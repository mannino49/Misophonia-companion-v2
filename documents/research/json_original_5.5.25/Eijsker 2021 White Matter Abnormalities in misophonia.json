Evidence for neurobiological abnormalities underlying misophonia is scarce. Since \nmany psychiatric disorders show white matter (WM) abnormalities, we tested for both macro and micro- \nstructural WM differences between misophonia patients and healthy controls. \nWe collected T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images from 24 patients and 25 \nmatched controls. We tested for group differences in WM volume using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry \nand used the significant voxels from this analysis as seeds for probabilistic tractography. After calculation of \ndiffusion tensors, we compared group means for fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and directional diffu-\nsivities, and applied tract-based spatial statistics for voxel-wise comparison. \nCompared to controls, patients had greater left-hemispheric WM volumes in the inferior fronto-occipital \nfasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, and body of the corpus callosum connecting bilateral superior frontal \ngyri. Patients also had lower averaged radial and mean diffusivities and voxel-wise comparison indicated large \nand widespread clusters of lower mean diffusivity. \nWe found both macro and microstructural WM abnormalities in our misophonia sample, suggesting miso-\nphonia symptomatology is associated with WM alterations. These biological alterations may be related to dif-\nferences in social-emotional processing, particularly recognition of facial affect, and to attention for affective \ninformation.   \n1.Introduction \nMisophonia is a newly described condition in which specific ordinary \nsounds, such as breathing or lip-smacking, provoke disproportionately \nstrong involuntary feelings of anger, anxiety, and/or disgust, with \naccompanying physiological arousal, such as sweating and increased \nheart rate, and skeletal muscle responses (see Edelstein et al., 2013; \nJager et al., 2020; Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014; Dozier et al., 2017 for \nreview; Dozier and Morrison 2017; Potgieter et al., 2019; Rouw and \nErfanian 2018; Schroder et al., 2013; Schroder et al., 2019 ). It has been \nproposed that low-intensity stimuli become conditioned triggers over \ntime, resulting in experience and context-dependent misophonic re-\nactions (Schroder et al., 2013; Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014; Dozier \n2015 ). Prevalence rate estimates vary between 3.2% (Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014 ) and 6% (Zhou et al., 2017 ). Population studies with \nundergraduate students indicate nearly 20–50% of students reported \nsome misophonia-like sound sensitivity (Naylor et al., 2021; Wu et al., \n2014 ), yet such studies are often subject to response bias (Groves et al., \n2004 ). In only 6% this was associated with clinical impairment (Zhou \net al., 2017 ) and when setting the threshold for clinical significance \nbased on symptom severity generally reported by help-seeking miso-\nphonia samples (Jager et al., 2020; Schroder et al., 2019 ), approximately \n12% of undergraduates would report clinically significant symptoms \n(Naylor et al., 2021 ). Misophonia symptoms are strongly associated with \nimpairments in work/study, social, and family life (Wu et al., 2014; \nZhou et al., 2017 ). The consistent and distinct pattern of symptoms \nsuggests it might be a discrete mental disorder (Jager et al., 2020; Pot-\ngieter et al., 2019; Schroder et al., 2013; Taylor 2017 ), yet \n*Corresponding author at: Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam 1105 AZ, The Netherlands. \nE-mail address: d.denys@amsterdamumc.nl (D.

Also areas responsible for sensory processing and \nbehavioral responses have been implicated (Cerliani and Rouw, 2020 ). \nFurthermore, evidence points to a symptom provocation-related wors-\nening of cognitive control on the Stroop task (Daniels et al., 2020 ), \ngenerally abnormal alerting attention (Frank et al., 2020 ), and a \nresponse bias – yet intact response inhibition – on the visual stop signal \ntask (Eijsker et al., 2019 ). We previously found higher resting-state \nfunctional connectivity between the amygdala and cerebellum, as well \nas within the visual cortex as part of the ventral attention network \n(Eijsker et al., 2021 ). This evidence points to patients additionally \nexhibiting attentional and behavioral abnormalities outside of \nsymptom-provoking contexts. Sensory function as early as pre-attentive \nauditory processing seems affected, as suggested by aberrant event- \nrelated electrophysiological potentials in response to (non-trigger) \noddball sounds (Schroder et al., 2014 ). \nOnly two studies have considered structural abnormalities in miso-\nphonia. In patients compared to controls, we previously found greater \ngray matter (GM) volume in the right amygdala (Eijsker et al., 2021 ), \nwhereas Kumar et al. (2017) found greater myelination of ventromedial \nprefrontal GM. White matter (WM) integrity is associated with global \ncognition and a range of executive and motor functions (Peters et al., \n2012; Vernooij et al., 2009 ). Therefore, it is not surprising that many \npsychiatric disorders show WM abnormalities. Functional aberrations \nlike those found in misophonia have been linked to WM structure ab-\nnormalities in other disorders. For instance, emotional disorders often \nshow reduced WM volumes, on the macrostructural scale, and integrity, \non a microstructural scale (Daniels et al., 2013; Jenkins et al., 2016 ). \nAdditionally, the poor attentional control found in adolescents with \nattentional, affective, and behavioral disorders has been linked to \ndecreased WM integrity in WM tracts that differed from those showing \nsuch a link in healthy participants (Shafer et al., 2020 ). Moreover, \ndecreased WM integrity has been linked to abnormal auditory and \nmultisensory processing and inattention in children with autism spec-\ntrum disorder and/or sensory processing disorders (Chang et al., 2014; \nOwen et al., 2013 ). Therefore, we tested whether misophonia patients \nshow differences in WM structure from healthy subjects. \nTo test for both macro and micro-structural WM differences between \npatients and controls, we used T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging \n(MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), respectively. Volumetric WM \nchanges can be assessed by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) \nto T1-weighted data, which is sensitive to local differences independent \nof large-scale brain volume (Ashburner and Friston 2001 ), whereas DTI \ndetects microstructural WM differences, including proxies for integrity \n(see Assaf and Pasternak 2008 for review). We also tested whether WM \nstructure correlated differently with age between the groups. Since re-\nports on WM structure in misophonia are close-to-none and there is \nconsiderable heterogeneity between more well-researched psychopa -\nthologies, such as trauma-related, autism-spectrum, and obsessive- \ncompulsive disorders (Daniels et al., 2013; Deramus and Kana 2015; \nvan den Heuvel et al., 2009 ), we opted for an exploratory whole-brain \nvoxel-wise approach. \n2.Materials & methods \n2.1. Participants \nTwenty-four misophonia patients were recruited from the Amster -\ndam University Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC, location Academic \nMedical Center) outpatient clinic. Patients underwent a standard psy-\nchiatric interview in which they were diagnosed on the basis of the criteria postulated by Schroder et al. (2013) by three AMC psychiatrists \nexperienced in diagnosing misophonia. The interview additionally \nassessed general medical and psychiatric histories. Twenty-five controls, \nmatched on age, sex, and education level, were recruited via adver -\ntisements at the Amsterdam UMC and University of Amsterdam. \nPotential participants, females and males aged between 18 and 65 \nyears, were assessed with a telephone interview by a psychiatrist (A.S.) \nnot involved in the initial misophonia diagnosis, in which they were \nasked about possible (additional) misophonia symptoms, psychiatric \ndiagnoses, current and previous health issues, medication use, alcohol or \nsubstance use, and handedness. We screened for personality disorders \nusing the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis II Disorders \n(SCID-II; First et al., 1997 ). Exclusion criteria for all participants \nincluded presence of major depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disor -\nder, psychotic disorder, autism spectrum disorder, substance related \ndisorder, hearing loss, epilepsy, structural central nervous system dis-\norder, stroke within the last year, and MRI contraindications. No hearing \ntests were applied, because previous extensive testing, including pure \ntone, speech audiometry, and loudness discomfort levels, of misophonia \npatients prior to receiving treatment, did not result in any notable \nhearing problems. An inclusion criterion only for patients was that they \nexperienced anger – a subset also experienced disgust – in reaction to \neating sounds and at least three of the following sounds: heavy breath -\ning/sniffling, keyboard typing, chewing, and slurping. One patient re-\nported symptoms with only two out of four sounds, but was still included \nbecause of severe symptoms. Patients additionally were required to not \nhave had treatment for their misophonia. Another exception was made \nfor one patient who had received unsuccessful treatment. Two patients \nhad comorbid attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder, of whom one \nused methylphenidate (30 mg daily), and another had a borderline \npersonality disorder. \nThe study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the \nAmsterdam UMC. All participants were informed about the nature of the \nexperimental procedures and subsequently provided written informed \nconsent prior to inclusion in the study. Current data were obtained in a \nlarger study in which we also collected functional MRI during symptom- \nprovocation (Schroder et al., 2019 ), performance of a stop signal task \n(Eijsker et al., 2019 ) and rest (Eijsker et al., 2021 ), with a total scanning \ntime of approximately 43 min. \n2.2. Demographic and clinical characteristics \nUsing SPSS software version 25 (IBM), we tested for group differ -\nences in sex, age, and education level to ensure demographically similar \ngroups. We also tested for group differences in score on the Symptom \nChecklist (SCL-90; Derogatis et al., 1973 ), Hamilton Anxiety and \nDepression Rating Scales (HAM-A; HAM-D; Hamilton 1959; Hamilton \n1960 ), and Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire subscales and total \nscore (BPAQ; Buss and Perry 1992 ) to assess differences in clinical \ncharacteristics. We used the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; \nSchroder et al., 2013 ), which is an adaptation of the Yale-Brown \nObsessive-Compulsive Scale (Goodman et al., 1989 ), to assess miso-\nphonia symptom severity. Factor analysis of A-MISO-S data has indi-\ncated it to be a unidimensional tool with good internal consistency \n(Naylor et al., 2021 ), yet further validation is needed. We compared \ngroups using Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Welch ’s t- \ntests for continuous variables, respectively. Effect sizes for these tests are \nexpressed in Phi coefficient and Cohen ’s d, respectively. We corrected \nfor testing 8 clinical scores using the Tukey-Ciminera-Heyse (TCH) \nmethod with the modification suggested by Sankoh et al. (1997) , which \ntakes the covariance of the tested measures into account and is suited \nwhen the scores are highly correlated (r F0.5). \n2.3. MRI data acquisition \nImages were acquired on a Philips Ingenia 3.0 T MRI system (Philips N. Eijsker et al."

To \nminimize movement artifacts, participants ’ heads were fixed using foam \npadding and participants were asked to lay as still as possible. We ac-\nquired whole-brain anatomical T1-weighted images (3D MP-RAGE, \nSENSE factor 2.5, voxel size 1 mm3, TR/TE 7000/3.2 ms, ma-\ntrix 256×256, field of view 256×240 mm, 180 transverse slices, \nscanning time 4 min and 14 s, automatic T1 stabilization) and diffusion- \nweighted images (2D spin-echo using a single shell without multiband \nacceleration and cardiac gating, SENSE factor 2, slice thickness 2 \nmm, TR/TE 8015/92 ms, matrix 112×112, field of view 224 mm, \n60 transverse slices, whole brain coverage) with diffusion gradients \napplied along 64 (n 46, scanning time 9 min and 31 s) or 48 (n 3; 1 \ncontrol and 2 patients, scanning time 6 min and 59 s) directions (b \n1000 s/mm2), and 4 (n 36) or 1 (n 13; 7 controls and 6 patients) \nreference b 0 image(s). No reverse-phase encoded scans were ac-\nquired. All DICOM files were converted to NifTI format using dcm2niix \n(https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix ). See Supplementary Table 1 \nfor additional acquisition information. \n2.3.1. VBM analysis \nT1-weighted images were preprocessed and analyzed in Statistical \nParametric Mapping (SPM) version 12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for \nNeuroimaging, 2014), implemented in Matlab version R2016a (The \nMathWorks, Inc.). The T1-weighted images were visually inspected and \ntheir origin was manually set to the anterior commissure to ensure \ncorrect segmentation. Then, they were segmented into GM, WM, and \ncorticospinal fluid (CSF) using rigid-body alignment and SPM ’s tissue \npriors, saving both native and Dartel imported images. Hereafter, WM \ntemplates were created using Dartel (Ashburner 2007; Ashburner and \nFriston 2009 ), which iteratively aligns the data to generate increasingly \ncrisp templates to which the native space images were subsequently \nspatially normalized. This resulted in WM maps in Montreal Neurolog -\nical Institute (MNI) space with voxels of 1.5 mm3, which were then \nsmoothed with an 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian \nkernel and Jacobian scaled. Total intracranial volume was calculated by \nsummation of GM, WM, and CSF volumes outputted by segmentation. \nWe added the groups to a general linear model, also adding age, sex, \nand total intracranial volume as covariates not-of-interest. All voxels \nwith intensities below 20% of the mean voxel intensity were excluded \nfrom analysis (absolute threshold masking at 0.2). We separately tested \nwhether the groups had a different relationship of age with a WM vol-\nume group ×age interaction, independent of overall group effects, and \nwith age demeaned within groups. No global normalization or overall \ngrand mean scaling were applied. Statistical tests were family-wise error \n(FWE) rate corrected for multiple comparisons at the peak level (p D\n0.05, two-tailed). \n2.3.2. DTI analysis \nDiffusion-weighted images were visually inspected and eddy qc was \nused for quality control (Bastiani et al., 2019 ). No movements exceeded \n3 mm of translation or 3 degrees of rotation and the groups did not differ \nin average (t(47) 0.1, p .93) or maximum (t(47) 0.3, p .77) \nmovement. Using MRtrix 3.0 functions, we denoised the data (dwi-\ndenoise ; Veraart et al., 2016 ), corrected for Gibbs ringing artefacts \n(mrdegibbs ; Kellner et al., 2016 ), extracted references images (dwiex -\ntract) and, if multiple were available, averaged them. Then, using \nfunctions from the FDT toolbox of FMRIB Software Library version 6.0 \n(FSL; http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ; Jenkinson et al., 2012 ), we \ncreated a binary brain mask by applying a 10% threshold (bet) to the \nreference images, which we then used to correct for eddy currents and \nsubject motion (eddy; Andersson and Sotiropoulos 2016 ). Weighted least \nsquares diffusion tensor models were subsequently fit at each voxel \n(dtifit), resulting in maps for each subject for diffusivity along the main \naxis – axial diffusivity (AD), the combined perpendicular axes – radial \ndiffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA), \nwhich describes how strongly oriented diffusivity is. Using the Tract- based Spatial Statistics (TBSS; Smith et al., 2006 ) toolbox, these maps \nwere aligned to the 1 mm3 FMRIB58_FA target provided by FSL, which is \nin MNI standard space. This was done by the nonlinear registration tool \nFNIRT (Andersson et al., 2007 ), which uses a b-spline representation of \nthe registration warp field (Rueckert et al., 1999 ). A threshold of 0.2 was \napplied to the average FA map to obtain a binary FA skeleton for use in \ngroup comparison. Lastly, subjects ’ aligned FA, MD, RD, and AD images \nwere projected onto this skeleton. \nFirst, we used Welch ’s t-tests to assess whether the means of these \nDTI measures differed between the groups and we calculated Cohen ’s d. \nWe corrected for testing 4 DTI measures using the modified TCH method \ndescribed above. Then, we applied voxel-wise statistical analysis to the \nFA, MD, RD, and AD maps using permutation testing (FSL ’s PALM ; \n10.000 permutations) with sex and age as covariates and Threshold-Free \nCluster Enhancement (TFCE), resulting in FWE-corrected p-values. \nUsing FSL’s cluster , we extracted cluster and peak information from the t- \nmap masked to show only significant voxels. Affected tracts were \nidentified using the JHU White-Matter Tractography Atlas and JHU \nICBM-DTI-81 White-Matter Labels (Mori et al., 2005; Wakana et al., \n2007; Hua et al., 2008 ). For visualization of the results, we fattened the \nresults to increase visibility using tbss_fill . We also tested whether the \ngroups had a different relationship of age with any DTI measure (group \n×age interaction, independent of overall group effects, and with age \ndemeaned within groups) again using permutation testing with TFCE. \nScans of 3 participants, 1 control and 2 patients, were acquired with \ndiffusion gradients in 48 instead of 64 directions, so we also tested \nwhether excluded these participants affected the results. \nLastly, we performed probabilistic tractography using the FDT \ntoolbox (BEDPOSTX; PROBTRACKX ), which uses Bayesian techniques \nand Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the most probable \nlocation of a pathway (Behrens et al., 2007 ). Due to a lack of evidence on \nmisophonia WM structure to inform tractography, we did fiber tracking \nusing the peak voxels of the VBM results as seeds. We did not perform \ntracking on the TBSS results, because these were considerably profuse \nand diffuse. After transforming the peak voxel MNI coordinates to sub-\nject space using SPM ’s coregister with nearest neighbor interpolation, \n5000 streamlines were initiated per seed using a step length of 0.5 mm \nand a curvature threshold of 0.2. We thresholded these maps to only \ncontain voxels with at least 20 (out of 5000) streamlines and binarized \nthem before transforming them back to MNI space using trilinear \ninterpolation. We inventoried the resulting tracts by identification using \nthe JHU WM Tractography and JHU ICBM-DTI-81 WM labels atlases. \nFor visualization, we then summed and thresholded these maps to only \nshow tracts shared by at least 50% of subjects. For two subjects, trac-\ntography using the seed depicted in Fig. 1A did not generate any plau-\nsible tracts. \n2.3.3. Correlational analysis \nTo see whether structural abnormalities had a linear relationship \nwith clinical characteristics in patients, we used SPSS to compute \nPearson correlations, for patients only, between WM volume at the peak \ncoordinates (based on p-value) and mean MD within the FA skeleton and \nscores on the A-MISOS-S, HAM-A, and anger subscale of the BPAQ. We \ncorrected for testing 3 clinical measures using the Dubey/Armitage- \nParmar (D/AP) method with the modification suggested by Sankoh \net al. (1997) , which is suited when the scores have low correlations (r D\n0.5). Lastly, we computed partial correlations to see whether correcting \nfor age and sex substantially influenced the correlations. \n3.Results \n3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics \nTable 1 shows group characteristics. The groups did not significantly \ndiffer in age, proportion of females/males, or education level.

White matter volume and probabilistic tractography \nPatients had greater WM volumes in frontal white matter (Fig. 1A \nand B) and we used the two significant peak voxels as seeds for proba -\nbilistic tractography. Tractography from the most anterior peak voxel (t \n(44) 5.17, p-FWE 0.044, MNI [–22, 54, \u00006]) showed streamlines \nalong the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and anterior \nthalamic radiation (ATR), whereas tractography from the peak voxel in \nthe body of the corpus callosum (BCC; t(44) 5.12, p-FWE 0.050, MNI \n[-15, 22, 27]) showed streamlines that extended bilaterally towards the \nsuperior frontal gyri (Fig. 1C). Additionally, this seed also showed \nstreamlines along the ATR, yet more along the dorsolateral aspect of the \nATR, whereas streamlines from the anterior peak voxel ran more along \nthe ventromedial aspect. We found no group ×age interactions for WM \nvolume. See Supplementary Table 2 for an overview of non-significant \nVBM results. 3.3. Diffusivity measures \nT-testing of FA, MD, RD, and AD averages indicated lower mean MD \nand RD within the FA skeleton of patients compared to controls, with \nCohen ’s d values around 0.8 (Table 2). Voxel-wise analysis indicated \nbilateral and widespread lower MD in patients compared to controls, \ncovering the forceps minor/genu of corpus callosum, superior and \ninferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the inferior fronto-occipital fascic -\nulus (Table 3; Fig. 2).

Prob-\nabilistic tractography using these locations as seeds implicated the \ninferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), anterior thalamic radiation \n(ATR), and the body of the corpus callosum (BCC). Patients also had \nlower averaged radial and mean diffusivities (RD and MD, respectively) \nwithin the fractional anisotropy (FA) skeleton and voxel-wise compari -\nson indicated large and widespread clusters of lower MD in patients \ncompared to controls. \nMacrostructural WM differences were found in tracts connecting \nfronto-polar and basal orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to occipital and su-\nperior parietal cortex (IFOF; Sarubbo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016 ) and \nthe medial portion of the superior frontal gyri bilaterally (BCC). Both \nseeds also generated streamlines along the ATR, which connects the OFC \nand dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) with the dorsomedial thalamus and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN; Coenen et al., 2012 ). On the \nmicrostructural level, patients had lower average MD and RD, which \nscale negatively with myelination and axonal density and positively \nwith presence of other cells, such as astrocytes, and axonal spacing and \nextracellular volume, respectively (Gulani et al., 2001; Mottershead \net al., 2003; Schwartz et al., 2004; Schmierer et al., 2008; Heckel et al., \n2015 ). Logically, an increase in axonal density is accompanied by \nincreased myelin volume and decreased extracellular space/axonal \nspacing. Since RD does not to correlate with myelin sheath thickness \n(Schwartz et al., 2004 ), these results likely reflect high myelin volume as \na result of high axonal density in patients (Gulani et al., 2001; Schmierer \net al., 2008 ). The findings also point to high WM integrity, because MD \nand RD scale negatively with FA and (sensory) nerve conduction ve-\nlocity, respectively (Gulani et al., 2001; Heckel et al., 2015 ). We found a \nmedium to large effect size (Cohen ’s d 0.6), though statistically \ninsignificant effect, for higher mean FA in patients. FA depends on the \nratio of the directional diffusivities, increasing when AD increases and/ \nor RD decreases. Both directional diffusivities were lower rather than \nhigher in patients, explaining why the group difference in MD, and not \nFA, reached statistical significance. Voxel-wise analysis indicated lower \nMD for patients compared to controls in various WM tracts, including \nbilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFOF), uncinate fasciculi \n(UF), anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), inferior and superior longitu -\ndinal fasciculi (ILF and SLF), and forceps minor and major (FMi and \nFMa). \nThe tracts affected in our misophonia patients are involved in two \ncooperative brain functions that are of particular relevance to miso-\nphonia: social-emotional processing and attention towards emotionally Table 1 \nDemographic and clinical characteristics.   \nControls (N 25) Patients (N 24) Statistical analysis \nTest statistic p-value Effect size \nSex (female; N, %) 19 (76%) 18 (75%) χ2 0.007 0.94 0.012 \nAge (years; mean, SD, range) 33.3 (9.8) 22–56 32.7 (9.5) 18–47 t(46.99) -0.22 0.83 \u00000.062 \nEducational level (median, range)]6 (2–7) 6 (2–7) χ2 0.72 0.87 0.122 \nAge of onset (years; mean, SD)  11.7 (3.3)     \nClinical measureszMean SD Mean SD    \nA-MISO-S   14.9 2.7    \nSCL-90 103.2 13.8 151.05 45.9 t(25.96) 4.83 D0.001¶  1.425 \nHAM-A 2.4 3.6 12.9 8.7 t(30.78) 5.51 D0.001¶  1.589 \nHAM-D 1.6 2.4 9.5 5.9 t(30.48) 6.09 D0.001¶  1.768  \nBPAQ        \nPhysical Aggression 16.3 3.3 19.5 5.8 t(34.25) 2.34 0.026  0.682 \nVerbal Aggression 11.8 2.9 12.0 2.9 t(45.62) 0.14 0.89  0.069 \nAnger 13.2 3.8 20.4 5.7 t(37.72) 5.08 D0.001¶  1.492 \nHate 14.2 4.0 20.3 8.0 t(31.87) 3.29 0.002¶  0.971 \nTotal score 55.8 9.4 72.1 18.5 t(32.05) 3.81 0.001¶  1.118 \nN number; SD standard deviation; A-MISO-S Amsterdam Misophonia Scale; SCL-90 Symptom Checklist; HAM-A Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; HAM-D \nHamilton Depression Rating Scale; BPAQ Bush Perry Aggression Questionnaire. \n]Educational level was categorized using the 2011 ISCED system (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2012), ranging from 0 (no finished education) to 8 (doctorate \nobtained). \nzMissing data: A-MISO-S: 1 patient, SCL90: 1 patient, 2 controls; HAM-A/HAM-D: 2 controls, BPAQ: 1 patient. \n¶Significant after TCH correction with Sankoh et al.

The ILF and UF connect the amygdala to the oc-\ncipital cortex, including the fusiform gyrus, and the OFC and frontal \npole, respectively.

Emotional \ndisorders were found to share alterations in the SLF, which the authors \nspecifically related to impaired perception of and attention to emotional \ninformation (Jenkins et al., 2016 ). The forceps minor and major connect \nthe bilateral frontal and occipital cortices, respectively. Higher MD and \nRD in the FMi of ADHD patients correlated positively with inattention \nand negatively with executive function (Lawrence et al., 2013 ), whereas \nthe FMa subserves visual processing. Lastly, the BCC connects bilateral \nsuperior frontal gyri. More specifically, the streamlines connected to a \nregion also called the Premotor Ear-Eye Field (PEEF) that is specifically \nsensitive to complex auditory information and involved in gaze-shifting \ntowards peripheral space based on information on sound spatial locali -\nzation from auditory cortex (see Lanzilotto et al., 2013 for review). \nThe functional role of both tracts and connected brain areas impli -\ncated in our imaging study fits well with the neuropsychological profile \nof misophonia. Aberrant social-emotional processing, particularly \nrecognition of facial emotion, is in line with the social nature of trigger \nsounds, which are generally produced by other humans, and previous \nstudies finding greater right amygdala volume and abnormal activation \nand heightened resting-state connectivity of the fusiform cortex (Eijsker \net al., 2021; Schroder et al., 2019 ), which processes stimuli of visual \nexpertise such as human faces (Burns et al., 2019; Fox et al., 2009 ). \nSpecifically, the latter was found with an independent component \nanalysis in both fusiform and superior occipital cortex as part of the \nventral attention network (Eijsker et al., 2021 ), which is involved in \nstimulus-driven attention. We interpreted this as sensory enhancement \nof trigger-related visual input, which we speculate could also be linked \nto the low MD in the FMi. WM abnormalities in attention-related net-\nworks is concordant with patients reporting heightened orientation to-\nwards aversive triggers, which activate the salience network, and their \nexperiencing difficulties to shift their attention to other aspects of the \nenvironment (Kumar et al., 2017; Schroder et al., 2019 ). Indeed, a se-\nlective attention impairment has been found in the presence of symptom \nprovoking sounds (da Silva and Sanchez 2018 ) and isin line with the \naberrant N1 potential reflecting early automatic attentional processes \n(Schroder et al., 2014 ). Frank et al. (2020) likewise found impaired \nalerting attention in misophonia patients, which was irrespective of \nexposure to trigger sounds, suggesting a general attention deficit rather \nthan a specific attentional bias. \nOur modest sample size limits the generalizability of the results and \npower of the analyses, explaining why group effects with considerable \neffect sizes did not reach statistical significance. Also, Kumar et al. \n(2017) found WM alterations within vmPFC, which we did not find. This \nis likely due to the authors limiting their structural analysis to the areas \nthat showed altered functional connectivity with the left anterior insula \nduring symptom provocation. We, on the other hand, performed whole- \nbrain exploratory analyses, which requires rigorous multiple compari -\nson correction and therefore detects only strong and/or widespread ef-\nfects. Still, replication of current results is warranted. Future studies \nmight relate WM alterations in misophonia to differences in emotional \nreactivity, attentional functioning, and cognitive control and the effect \nof symptom-provocation hereon. Specifically, considering the amount of \nevidence implicating alterations in amygdala, fronto-parietal, and oc-\ncipital areas, especially the fusiform cortices, we propose direct inves -\ntigation of processing of trigger-related visual scenes in misophonia. \nThis would primarily focus on human faces, considering the prevalence \nof nasal and oral misophonia triggers (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schroder \net al., 2013 ). \nIn conclusion, we have found both macro and microstructural WM \nalterations in misophonia patients, implicating systems involved in \nsocial-emotional and attentional processing. These results provide \nfurther evidence for a neurobiological basis of misophonia. Yet addi-\ntional research remains required to establish its biological basis that may \nprovide the foundation for its classification as a discrete disorder.
