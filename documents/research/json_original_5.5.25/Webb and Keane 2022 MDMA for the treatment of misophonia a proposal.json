Up to 50% of\npopulation samples endorse some symptoms of misophonia, with about\n20% having symptoms that impair normal life functioning. Most misophonia\npatients exhibit intense negative emotions and autonomic arousal (the ﬁght-\nﬂight-freeze response) in response to a trigger, similarly to how someone\nwith post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might respond to a trauma\ntrigger. Curiously, misophonia trigger sounds are often most distressing when\ncoming from a speciﬁc person, suggesting the disorder may be responsive\nto interpersonal relationship factors. Treatment of misophonia is currently\nlimited to the use of hearing modiﬁcations (e.g., earplugs or headphones)\nand psychotherapy, but many patients continue to suffer despite these best\nefforts. Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that MDMA is efﬁcacious at treating\nthe symptoms of autonomic arousal, negative emotions, and interpersonal\nsuffering found in PTSD. As such, we propose that MDMA may represent an\nideal treatment for some suffering from severe misophonia. In this perspective\narticle, we review the symptoms of misophonia, and outline how MDMA may\nbe uniquely suited for treating it, perhaps using a protocol analogous to the\nMAPS Phase 3 studies for PTSD.\nKEYWORDS\nMDMA, PTSD, misophonia, trauma response, psychedelic\nIntroduction\nMisophonia is a disorder characterized by exaggerated, negative emotional, and\nphysiological responses to otherwise benign sounds. The response to a trigger activates\nthe autonomic nervous system in a “ﬁght-ﬂight-freeze” response (1), which is distinct\nfrom how most other people respond to sounds that annoy them (2).\nThe term misophonia was ﬁrst used in 2001 (3), but as of this writing, has not yet\nbeen classiﬁed as a formal diagnosis in the DSM-V or ICD-11. Limiting issues so far\ninclude lack of a consistent deﬁnition and coherent diagnostic criteria for misophonia,\nalthough this is now being addressed through consensus work groups (2).

Given how\nuniversal and prevalent this distressing phenomenon is, it\nis surprising that it has taken this long for the clinical and\nscientiﬁc community to identify it as a clinical entity, let alone\nbegin formulating ways to treat it.\nTreatments for misophonia are still scarce and mostly\ninvolve audiology interventions (e.g., white noise generating\nhearing aids) or variations of cognitive behavioral therapy (7).\nThere are no controlled studies of medications yet, although case\nreports suggest that antidepressants (8–11), anxiolytics (12),\nstimulants (13), antipsychotics (14), and beta blockers (15) may\nhelp in some cases.\nThe biological mechanism of misophonia is slowly being\nelucidated (16, 17), and there are tantalizing clues that it\nshares overlap with the emotional and autonomic overreaction\nobserved in other mental health disorders, such as post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, and speciﬁc\nphobias. Many so-called “misophones” react to a trigger sound\nanalogously to how, for example, a soldier with PTSD after\nexposure to a bomb explosion might respond to hearing\nﬁreworks during a celebration, or how someone with a phobia\nof spiders may feel when encountering one. A ﬂood of negative\nemotions and a surge in “ﬁght-ﬂight-freeze” sympathetic arousal\nis common to these examples.\nAn unusual feature of misophonia is that a trigger sound\n(such as chewing) is often much more distressing when\ngenerated by a speciﬁc person (7), usually someone emotionally\nclose to the patient such as a parent or spouse. Other types\nof relationships, such as a new romantic interest, can have the\nopposite eﬀect, and may reduce perceived distress from a trigger.\nTrigger reactions to a sound are also more likely when the\nsound is felt by the patient to violate a rule or social norm.\nFor example, the sound of loud bass drums at a concert may\nbe perceived as acceptable or even enjoyable, but may become\na disabling trigger if a next door neighbor is playing music at\nnight, even if playing it quietly. An adult “rudely” smacking their\nlips may elicit uncontrollable rage, but this lip smacking may\nnot be noticed when generated by an infant who is perceived\nas too young to “know any better” (7). This suggests that\nmisophonia is not simply a reaction to the physical qualities of a\nsound, but that higher-order ﬁlters around relationship quality\nand social norms help modulate the perceived trigger distress,\nand may help determine whether the brain will activate a full\nﬁght-or-ﬂight response.\nMDMA is eﬃcacious in treating disorders of autonomic\narousal from negative stimuli. Recent Phase III trials (18), for\ninstance, suggest that it might be a eﬃcacious pharmacological\ntreatment we currently have for PTSD. MDMA also increases\nempathetic, prosocial feelings toward others, and may be\nfairly unique in addressing negative emotions arising frominteractions with others. These eﬀects may address two core\nproblems with misophonia: interpreting an otherwise benign\ntriggering event as being very emotionally negative, and the\ninappropriate activation of a threat response (ﬁght-or-ﬂight)\nthat typically comes with it.\nIn this perspective article, we examine the emotional\nand physiological features of misophonia and highlight the\nsigniﬁcant symptomatic overlap with other problems and\ndisorders that MDMA appears to be eﬃcacious at treating.\nWe hope this can serve as a framework for future clinical\ntrials for this common, sometimes disabling, and vastly\nunderstudied disorder.\nMethod of literature review for this\nperspective article\nWe searched the literature (PubMed, Google Scholar) for\nany publication with the term “misophonia”. One hundred\ntwenty results were returned, and were independently\nreviewed by both authors. The term “misophonia” yielded\nmultiple reports that explored the characteristic emotional and\nphysiological symptoms and proposed biological mechanisms\nunderpinning misophonia. Of note, misophonia was not found\nin association with the terms “MDMA, ” or any other dissociative\nor psychedelic treatments such as “ketamine”, “psychedelics, ” or\n“psilocybin”.\nTo review the eﬀects of MDMA on emotional and\nphysiological symptoms relevant to misophonia, we focused\non reports containing the term “misophonia” and any of the\nfollowing: “anxiety, ” “post-traumatic stress disorder/PTSD, ” and\n“phobia.” To review eﬀects on interpersonal relationships, we\nexamined the terms: “empathy, ” “relationship, ” “mirror” (for\nmirror neurons), and “interpersonal.” We also examined eﬀects\nof MDMA on the perception of negative stimuli, especially\nsound issues commonly associated with misophonia, and by\nsearching the terms “auditory, ” “phonophobia, ” “tinnitus, ” and\n“hyperacusis.”\nIn addition to search term reviews, references cited in recent\nreviews and meta-analyses were also examined, as were the\n“cited by” references in PubMed when examining key papers.\nWe also searched https://clinicaltrials.gov/ for any future trails\nof misophonia and found four results, but none related to\nMDMA, psychedelics, or any other medication intervention.\nThe literature regarding the mechanism and treatment of\nPTSD and other anxiety disorders is vast, and far beyond\nthe scope of this paper to fully capture. The study of the\nneurobiology of human relationships is similarly extensive, and\nbeyond the scope of this work. As such, we examined the most\nrecent reviews and meta-analyses on this subject (papers cited in\nResults section), to ensure an up-to-date accounting of the most\nrecent mechanistic hypotheses, which were then compared to\nthe literature regarding the mechanism of misophonia.

They\nare often repetitive in nature, and most commonly generated by\nthe mouth or nose of others. Chewing noises are prototypic, and\nare perhaps the most common trigger. That said, a vast number\nof diﬀerent trigger sounds have been described, including\nnon-human sounds such as dogs barking, water dripping, or\nthe sound of percussion instruments. Of note, other sensory\nmodalities can also serve as triggers and visual triggers (termed\nmisokinesia) are also quite common. Sound triggers are the\nmost extensively characterized, and are thus the focus for this\nperspective article.\nTrigger sounds can lead to extreme distress, and are often\ncompared to “the sound of nails on a chalkboard, ” or for\nsome, the feeling of being terrorized or physically assaulted.\nThe distress from triggers can lead to impaired school or\njob performance, avoidance of certain normal life activities,\nsocial isolation, reduced life quality, and in extreme cases, self-\nharm (19).\nSince misophonia involves a reaction to sound, it is\noften thought of as an auditory disorder, and frequently\nmentioned with other hearing problems such as tinnitus or\nhyperacusis (20). However, research now suggests that the\nperipheral auditory system, such as the tympanic membrane\nand auditory auditory nerve, is not the source of dysfunction in\nmisophonia and that misophonia may not be related to other\nperipheral auditory problems. As seen in recent research by\n(21), misophonia appears to be a higher-order, central nervous\nsystem problem, rather than due to pathology of the peripheral\nauditory pathway.\nEmotional response\nTrigger sounds characteristically cause an unpleasant,\naversive emotional response. Anger and rage has been the\nmost commonly reported emotion, experienced by up to 90%\nof respondents in surveys (7, 22). Anxiety, panic, disgust,\nresentment, and self-loathing are other common emotions that\ncan occur during a trigger.\nAfter an acute trigger response is over, many misophones\nfeel a sense of depression and guilt around how they\nresponded, especially if they had hostile thoughts or actions\ntoward someone. The intensity of these adverse emotions can\nsometimes lead to extreme feelings of hopelessness and even\nsuicidal ideation. Some also experience repetitive, intrusive\nthoughts about the trigger and may continue to hear the sound\nrepeat in their head, leading to continued physiological responsesymptoms. Anticipatory anxiety around future triggers is also\ncommon, and can lead to avoidance of situations that might\ncause a trigger.\nIn many cases, an adverse reaction to a trigger sound will\nonly occur when produced by certain people (1). Because of this\nunusual phenomenon, misophonia patients will often develop\nintense negative thoughts and feelings about this other person.\nResentment and hostility toward the trigger person is common,\nwith an internal narrative that the other person must not\ncare about them and is being intentionally rude, or is perhaps\nunacceptably oblivious to polite social manners that “should\nhave” convinced them not to make the trigger sound. Many\nmisophones recognize that these thoughts are irrational, and\ncan vocalize this in an interview, yet will still ﬁnd themselves\nhaving them during a trigger reaction, and even afterward (23).\nThis dichotomy of caring about another person while still feeling\na sense of hostility or avoidance toward them can be very\ndistressing, and often convinces the misophone that something\nis terribly wrong with them. Many will “joke” about believing\nthat they may have sociopathic traits, or worry that they may\nbecome “psychotic” or violent later in life.\nIn many cases, the hostile or avoidant reaction from the\nmisophone leads to interpersonal relationship troubles. It\nis characteristically hard for many misophones to explain\ntheir symptoms to a partner or family member. The\ndescription of symptoms often sounds, to the partner,\nas an attack on them for something that should be\nrelatively benign, such as the way they eat food. This\ncan lead to anger, confusion, and resentment in both\npartners, and compensatory activities that further harm\nthe relationship, such as if the patient will no longer eat meals\nwith their partner.\nPhysical/autonomic response\nVirtually all misophonic reactions to trigger sounds involve\nan immediate, involuntary autonomic response (1). The speciﬁc\nsymptoms vary somewhat from person to person, but generally\nsuggest a surge of sympathetic hormones leading to the so-\ncalled “ﬁght-ﬂight-freeze” response normally experienced in\nresponse to a dangerous threat. The symptoms also overlap\nconsiderably with someone exposed to a phobic threat, or\nduring a panic attack.\nAutonomic arousal happens within milliseconds of hearing\na trigger sound, and feels like an overwhelming surge of\nemotion and bodily sensations that cannot be consciously\ncontrolled. Common symptoms include: elevated heart rate,\nincreased respiratory rate, increased blood pressure, increased\nbody temperature, sweating, clenched or tense muscles, and a\npervasive sense of needing to ﬁght the trigger or ﬂee from it.\nMany misophones report being unable to think rationally when\nbeing triggered, and some will scream at or even hit the trigger\nsource. They often feel as if their body is overtaken by the\nintense neurophysiological changes, so that their entire focus\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org"

Annoying sounds can produce measurable\nphysiological eﬀects in humans, but do not typically elicit a ﬁght-\nﬂight-freeze trigger reaction normally seen when someone is\nintensely afraid or in grave danger.\nNeurobiology of misophonia\nMisophonia does not appear to arise from abnormalities\nin the peripheral auditory system as might be expected from\nhearing loss or tinnitus. Central auditory processing, on the\nother hand, was found to be abnormal for misophonia patients\nas measured by N1 auditory evoked potentials to oddball stimuli\n(24). Functional neuroimaging has also shown overactivity\nin the auditory cortex in misophones compared to controls\n(25, 26).\nBut these diﬀerences in central auditory processing do\nnot fully explain the symptom constellation observed in\nmisophonia, such as why highly speciﬁc, complex sounds\nare triggering, as opposed to types of sound with a certain\naudiological certain quality such as those that are too loud\nor high pitched, which we might expect from a peripheral\nauditory hypersensitivity. Auditory processing issues also do\nnot explain why trigger reactions seem to arise preferentially\nfrom certain people or only in certain social or environmental\ncontexts. And as noted, the intensity of the reaction to triggers\nis unlike the reaction to regular annoying sounds, and more\nresembles a reaction to life-threatening danger. These symptoms\nsuggest unique abnormalities in brain regions connecting\nsensory input to higher-order emotional processing and threat\nrecognition centers.\nChanges in those with misophonia have indeed been\nobserved in regions that mediate connection between\nperception of stimuli and emotions, in particular, increased\nactivation of the right anterior insular cortex (AIC), a core part\nof the salience network (25, 27). Abnormal connections between\nthe AIC and the posteromedial cortex (PMC), ventromedial\nprefrontal cortex (vmPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus were\nalso observed. The AIC is critical for managing focus and\nattention, and ensuring someone can devote the needed mental\nresources to processing a complex task. In line with these\nobservations, many misophones describe trigger sounds as\nbeing mentally intrusive (1). Studies similarly show that trigger\nsounds disrupt attention and focus in misophonia patients,\nwhen compared to disruption from simply hearing an annoying\nsound (28). This suggests that misophonia triggers are not\nsimply “annoying sounds” in the conventional sense, but\nmay be causing a deeper sense of cognitive disruption. Being\ninterrupted while trying to focus is commonly experienced\nas irritation and anger, which are also emotions commonly\nexperienced in response to a misophonia trigger.Positron Emission Tomography scans have revealed that\nMDMA decreases blood ﬂow to the motor and somatosensory\ncortex (29), which are regions important to the motor\nsensory integration component of misophonia. Blood decreases\nwere also observed in regions central to negative emotional\nprocessing, including temporal lobe, left amygdala, cingulate\ncortex, right anterior insula and thalamus (29, 30). This may\nsuggest a reduction in activity of these emotional centers\ninvolved in overactive threat responses, such as those suﬀering\nfrom PTSD and anxiety (31).\nMisophonia seems to involve overlapping brain regions\nalso aﬀected by MDMA, including the left amygdala, anterior\ninsular cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex (25–27, 32).\nMisophones also seem to exhibit overactivation of their left\namygdala and temporal lobe in direct response to auditory\ntriggers (32). Speciﬁcally, results showed hyperactivity in the\nbilateral superior temporal cortex during triggering episodes in\nmisophones. Increased activity in the left amygdala could also\nexplain the hypervigilance that is seen in misophones when\nexposed to particular triggers (32).\nA breakthrough in mechanistic thought about misophonia\nis that it may be due, at least in part, to excessive activity of\nthe brain’s motor system and mirror neurons. Mirror neurons\nrecognize complex behaviors and activity sequences in others\n(26). This system is thought to be crucial for understanding the\nactions, intentions, and emotions of others (33–35), and may\nplay a key role in socializing and having empathy for others (36).\nAt a more basic level, when mirror neurons recognize an\nactivity sequence in someone else (such as chewing food), the\nmotor cortex activates as if the observer was actually doing that\nactivity. It has been proposed that in misophonia, these mirror\nneurons may be “hyper-responding” to activities associated with\na trigger, and that this hyper-response causes distress (26).\nThe mechanism of misophonia appears to be quite complex,\nand involves aspects of cortical auditory processing, changes in\nattention and focus, aberrant negative emotional interpretation\nof a stimulus, and a corresponding physiological threat\nresponse. It will likely take many years before it is completely\nunderstood, but attempts to develop symptomatic treatments\nneed not wait this long. Misophonic reactions to triggers share\nconsiderable symptom overlap with other disorders that are\nbetter understood, and that have already powerfully responded\nto treatments such as MDMA.\nSimilarities of misophonia to post-traumatic\nstress disorder\nThe misophonic response to triggers shares considerable\nsymptom overlap with sound trigger responses observed in\nPTSD. As with misophonia, those suﬀering from PTSD can\nexperience a very strong emotional and physiological response\nto speciﬁc stimuli (such as sounds) that do not bother most\npeople. For example, someone who was abused may be triggered\nby the sound of a voice that resembles the attacker.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 04 frontiersin.org"

Autonomic hyperarousal\nis a risk factor for developing PTSD symptoms (37), and\nthose suﬀering from PTSD tend to have increased baseline\nsympathetic nerve activity (38). These autonomic symptoms\nbear a striking resemblance to those often observed in\nmisophonia, and notably, PTSD was found to be a common\ncomorbid condition with misophonia (39). This may speak to\ncommon underlying neurobiological traits and vulnerabilities\nfor both disorders.\nIt is important to note that although there are similarities\nbetween PTSD and misophonia, there are also many\nfundamental diﬀerences in these two disorders as well. PTSD is\nspeciﬁcally deﬁned as having an automatic strong reactivity to\na spontaneous, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memory\nof a terrifying traumatic event (39). While in misophonia, the\nstrong negative emotional reactivity is triggered by seemingly\nharmless stimuli only. PTSD and misophonia are two very\ndistinct disorders that also happen to share similar symptom\nproﬁles and neurobiological mechanisms.\nPTSD also features other symptoms not typical of\nmisophonia, such as intrusive recall of the trauma, emotional\nnumbing, an exaggerated startle response, and frequent\nﬂashbacks. These diﬀering symptoms clearly highlight how\nthese are diﬀerent disorders, just as PTSD is also not the same\nthing as, say, a speciﬁc phobia. That said, the strong overlap\nof inappropriate autonomic activation in both oﬀers clues\ninto what medication treatments might be useful. Medications\nthat reduce autonomic hyperactivity can reduce many of the\ndistressing symptoms of PTSD (40). And intriguingly, there are\nemerging observations that medications that reduce autonomic\nresponse may also be helpful in some cases of misophonia (15).\nFrom a neurobiological perspective, a hyperactive amygdala\nis observed in PTSD (41), and similarly, an enlarged and\noveractive amygdala is also observed in misophonia (17).\nAbnormal connectivity between the insula is also observed in\nboth misophonia and PTSD (42). While there are some general\nfunctional central nervous system (CNS) similarities with PTSD\nand misophonia, the complexities of measuring brain activity\nin response to stressors is complex and relies on numerous\nenvironmental and study population variables particular to each\nstudy. As such, a direct comparison under similar experimental\ncircumstances will be needed to more deﬁnitively compare CNS\nactivity between PTSD and misophonia.\nSimilarities of misophonia to panic and phobias\nWhile anger is the most common emotion experienced\nduring a trigger, anxiety, and panic are also very common.\nThe physiological symptoms of intense anxiety, phobia, andpanic attacks are very similar to those experienced in response\nto a misophonia trigger; and panic disorder and anxiety\nalso frequently co-occur in those suﬀering from misophonia\n(43). This may suggest some common mechanisms and\nvulnerabilities.\nIt is worth noting that misophones generally do not feel\nafraid of their triggers (1). As such, the misophonic response\nis not simply a phobia of sounds, which is a separate disorder\ntermed phonophobia. Phonophobia is more speciﬁcally a fear or\nintolerance to sounds, based on speciﬁc physical characteristics\nof sound such as volume and pitch. It usually arises secondary\nto an illness or defect in the peripheral auditory pathway\nthat causes an unpleasant sensitization to the sound, resulting\nin the patient becoming afraid or avoidant of sounds with\nthose qualities (44). This is diﬀerent from misophonia, which\nis a highly speciﬁc aversion to often quiet, non-threatening\nsounds that do not appear to be aversive based on their\nphysical qualities.\nMisophonia and other psychiatric disorders\nOther psychiatric disorders, such as depression, OCD, and\nanorexia can co-occur in misophonia, and may moderate the\nseverity of the symptoms (39). The wide variety of disorders\nthat may be associated with, and may aﬀect, the experience of\nmisophonia highlights how much we have yet to learn about it.\nProposed MDMA effects on\nrelevant misophonia symptoms\nThere are no formal studies on the use of MDMA to\ntreat misophonia, and so this proposal stems from theoretical\nobservations of how MDMA works.\nMDMA effects on perception of\nnegative external stimuli (e.g., sounds)\nThe process of being triggered from a sound likely\ninvolves, to some extent, abnormal auditory processing.\nImportantly, MDMA can aﬀect the perception of sound.\nAnimal models show that auditory sensory gating is directly\naﬀected during MDMA use (45), and that this action\ndepends on the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A (46). Since\nauditory gating may also be aﬀected in misophonia (24),\nit would be of interest to see if MDMA administration\ncould counteract these auditory gating abnormalities, but this\nremains to be examined.\nA study in healthy recreational MDMA users showed\nthat 75 mg reduced autonomic arousal to negative/unpleasant\nsounds, independent of the overall level of arousal (47). The\nauthors speciﬁcally noted that clients “felt less discomfort or\nmore at ease” when exposed to unpleasant sounds. While this\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org"

It is particularly\neﬀecacious at inhibiting a fearful or avoidant response to\nsuch stimuli, while allowing the user to maintain rational\ncognitive control, such as during a psychotherapy session.\nThe mechanism for this is not clear, but some have noted\nthat since MDMA decreases cortisol levels and amygdala\nactivation, which may allow the patient to better access\ndiﬃcult, emotional material in the session. At the same\ntime, MDMA may increase oxytocin levels (31), allowing for\nstronger bonding with the therapist and/or partner during the\ntherapy session.\nIn rodent models, MDMA may also modulate how fearful\nor unpleasant memories are recalled, again allowing for a\ncalmer, safer approach to processing them during a therapy\nsession (50). It may also improve the extinction of any\naversive emotions attached to unpleasant memories when\ndoing exposure-based therapy (51, 52), although the degree\nto which this happens is disputed (53). This impact on prior\nlearned emotional responses may oﬀer a way to also re-imagine\nthe emotions attached to triggers, and to the people who\nproduce those triggers.\nMDMA effects on disorders of\nautonomic hyperarousal (PTSD)\nMisophonia triggers induce a strong autonomic response\nthat mediates much of the physical symptoms, and can reinforce\nthe emotional perception of the trigger as being aversive,\nanalogous to the strong autonomic symptoms experienced\nduring a phobia reaction, panic attack, or a PTSD trigger.\nA pharmacological agent that could reduce this strong\nnegative, autonomic response may thus potentially be an\neﬀective treatment.\nNumerous reviews and meta-analyses consistently support\nMDMA as eﬃcacious for treating PTSD symptoms, even\nlong after the acute eﬀects of the drug (40, 54–60). These\nclinical beneﬁts appear to exceed any oﬀered by current\nﬁrst-line pharmacological treatments (61). A recently\ncompleted Phase III clinical trial (18) has similarly shown\ngood eﬃcacy for PTSD, and therefore, MDMA may soon\nbe oﬀered as a mainstream treatment for it. MDMA is\nalso showing promise for treating other anxiety-spectrum\ndisorders, particularly social anxiety (62). The eﬀects on\nother disorders such as phobias and panic are unclear, and\nneed more study.MDMA effects on rigidity and internal\nruminations\nMDMA and other entactogens have a unique ability to\npromote cognitive ﬂexibility, and help patients get unstuck from\nnegative thinking patterns that trap them in cycles of depression,\nanxiety, and PTSD. Patients will sometimes report feeling able\nto see a problem with a brand new perspective and see more\nhelpful ways to reframe it, or perhaps be able to forgive and\nclose a chapter on a painful topic. Indeed, negative memories are\nrated as less negative by subjects taking MDMA, while positive\nmemories are remembered more vividly (63).\nWhile external stimuli (triggers) are the main immediate\nsource of distress in misophonia, internal negative thoughts\nand feelings may also reinforce or aggravate the disorder, and\nperhaps sensitize the patient to have a stronger negative reaction\ntoward future triggers.\nThe sounds that become triggers also often associate with\nactivities seen as violating a social rule or norm. For instance,\na patient may develop a trigger reaction to family members\neating with their mouth open, when it has been implied in\nthat family that eating with your mouth open is rude. Hearing\nthumping music being played late at night violates the generally\naccepted social norm of not playing loud music after hours.\nWhile many people can get annoyed at late night loud music, for\nthe misophone, this dislike may grow over time into an intense,\ntriggering rage even when the music is not overly loud or rude.\nMisophonia suﬀerers have high levels of neuroticism (64),\nand anecdotally, often report that a more rigid insistence of\nrules and social norms may make them less tolerant of sounds\nand behaviors that may seem to violate these. Addressing\nneurotic personality traits is diﬃcult and usually requires years\nof therapy, often with incomplete results. MDMA can increase\nfeelings that run counter to a self-critical, neurotic state, namely:\nself-compassion, empathy, forgiveness, openness, and reduced\nfeelings of conﬂict (65–67). This may open a window of\ncognitive ﬂexibility to challenge how “rude” or “inappropriate”\na trigger sound really is. If a trigger sound could be reframed\nas something reasonable and acceptable, the distress around\nit may be reduced.\nMDMA effects on relationship quality\nA very unusual characteristic of misophonia trigger sounds\nis that they are often localized to speciﬁc people. Chewing\nsounds from friends may elicit no reaction, while the same\nchewing sounds from a parent may be intolerable. Certain\nkinds of emotive, new highly desirable relationships (e.g.,\nromantic), are anecdotally reported to be protective against\ntrigger eﬀects. This relationship speciﬁcity suggests that the\ninterpersonal, emotional context of a trigger may also play a role\nin determining its severity. If this is the case, then changing the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org"

Couples who\nuse MDMA often report sustained, reduced conﬂict, increased\nempathy for each other, happiness, feelings of closeness,\ncommunicativeness, generosity, attachment safety, bonding,\nand intimacy (65, 68, 69). MDMA signiﬁcantly increased the\nperceived pleasantness of human to human slow touch, but did\nincrease perceived pleasantness of fast touch (70, 71).\nThe prosocial eﬀects of MDMA were found to occur\namong couples in which one was suﬀering from prior trauma\n(69). MDMA thus appears to be a promising pharmacological\ntreatment for couples undergoing therapy (Cognitive Behavioral\nConjoint Therapy) when one partner has PTSD, with high\noverall satisfaction rates for both partners (72).\nThe biological mechanism of MDMA\neffects on misophonia\nIt has been previously noted that MDMA increases\nserotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine activity by\nstimulating neurotransmitter release and inhibiting\nneurotransmitter reuptake in the synaptic cleft (73).\nThis is thought to be part of the reason for the positive,\neuphoric eﬀects. MDMA also directly binds to and\nstimulates serotonin 2A receptors (5HT2AR) (74), and\nmany of MDMA ’s eﬀects on anxiety, fear, and processing\nof emotions appear dependent on normal functioning of\nthis receptor. MDMA also improves the results of exposure-\nbased therapy for PTSD, perhaps due to enhancement of\nfear memory extinction, although some studies dispute\nthis (50). In animal models, blocking the 5-HT transporter\n(5-HTT) eliminated fear memory extinction eﬀects (52),\nagain highlighting the importance of the 5-HTT and\n5-HT2A receptors.\nOf critical importance to misophonia, 5-HT2A receptors\nappear to also be critical for MDMA ’s ability to reduce\narousal caused by negative sounds (47). However, MDMA\nalso aﬀects numerous other neurotransmitters, hormones, and\nother gene regulators critical to homeostasis and emotional\nregulation, such as glutamate, oxytocin, cortisol, vasopressin,\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, and brain-\nderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (51, 75–77).\nLooking even more broadly, other biological systems related\nto inﬂammation and immune regulation may also help mediate\nthe eﬀects of MDMA (78). Whole-genome microarrays in\nanimal models exposed to MDMA show hundreds of gene\nexpression changes from a variety of diﬀerent cellular processes\n(79). These changes vary depending on location in the brain,\nconcurrent environmental cues, and also no doubt will varydepending on the animal model used (none have yet been\ndone in humans). As such, it is clear that a comprehensive\nmolecular understanding of how MDMA eﬀects change is still\nsome distance away.\nMeantime, regardless of how MDMA actually produces\nits neuropsychiatric eﬀects, we should not lose sight of how\nbeneﬁcial it can be in treating disorders that are otherwise\nnotoriously diﬃcult to help. Thus, the development of treatment\nprotocols should not wait on certain determination of the\nunderlying mechanism.\nDiscussion and proposed\ntreatment protocol\nMDMA oﬀers a unique constellation of beneﬁts that appears\nalmost custom-ﬁt for the symptoms commonly encountered\nin misophonia. It directly reduces autonomic reaction to\naversive sounds, and shows promise for treating disorders\ncharacterized by abnormal autonomic arousal (e.g., PTSD).\nMDMA reduces the fear and avoidance while promoting\nopenness, acceptance, and empathy, which may open a new\nwindow during psychotherapy sessions to retrain the negative\nresponse to misophonia triggers.\nMDMA also appears to uniquely address neurotic\nruminations while also reducing negative feelings that\nunderpin interpersonal conﬂict. We anticipate some cases\nin which a patient in assistive therapy will realize that they\nwere subconsciously holding on to social norms, neuroses, or\nresentments that are aggravating the emotional and autonomic\nresponse to triggers. The neuroplastic state induced by MDMA\nmay allow deeper ruminative underpinnings triggers to be\nconsciously identiﬁed, and perhaps laid to rest.\nThe ability of MDMA to facilitate healing in couples in\nwhich one member suﬀers from PTSD may be particularly\ngermane to misophonia. As with PTSD, the patient with\nmisophonia often suﬀers from abnormal emotional and\nphysiological responses to the partner, and the partner also\nsuﬀers as a result of these abnormal reactions. The beneﬁcial\neﬀect of MDMA on both people may thus oﬀer a unique\napproach to severe cases of misophonia in which both\npartners are suﬀering.\nRisks of using MDMA for misophonia\nMDMA is generally safe and well tolerated when used in\na therapeutic setting, and most side eﬀects occurred during\nacute treatment, and were transient. In a large study in healthy\nvolunteers (80), side eﬀects included a temporary increase in\nblood pressure, tachycardia, and increased body temperature\nin about 1/3 of participants, with no serious adverse eﬀects.\nA meta-analysis of MDMA for treating PTSD (54) also found\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org"

One of the most serious theoretical concerns\n(serotonin syndrome), is based on MDMA ’s ability to increase\nserotonergic activity, but so far no cases have been reported\nin clinical studies (81). Not all experience MDMA as pleasant\nand instead may feel anxiety and panic during a session (82),\nand thus it is necessary to counsel clients ahead of time that it\nis possible they will not enjoy or beneﬁt from the experience.\nIt is also possible that MDMA will not help some cases of\nmisophonia, which could be disappointing, particularly since\nthere are few other pharmacological alternatives at this time.\nIt is critical to understand that recreational use of MDMA\nis NOT recommended at all. This is a powerful treatment\nthat must be administered in a safe setting, by a trained\nmedical and psychological professional. The concentration and\npurity of MDMA used outside of research settings cannot\nbe validated since this still remains a schedule 1 substance.\nConsuming MDMA recreationally may involve risks such as\ningesting impure substances, ingesting excess amounts, and\nexperiencing unpleasant eﬀects in unsafe environments. Before\nrecommending MDMA to people struggling from misophonia,\nrandomized controlled trials with good generalizability are\nneeded for evaluating the eﬀectiveness of this treatment.\nProposed model for treatment of\nmisophonia with MDMA-assisted\ntherapy\nBased on the analogy of misophonia trigger symptoms\nwith PTSD, it seems likely that MDMA is a eﬃcacious\npharmacological treatment for PTSD, and may also be of beneﬁt\nin misophonia, both for individuals suﬀering, and for couples\nwho are both aﬀected as they often are in PTSD (69). Given the\nsimilarity of symptoms, we see no reason to deviate from the\nprotocol used in Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic\nStudies (MAPS ) Phase 3 studies.\nMAPS is one of the leading organizations investigating\nthe use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treating disorders\nsuch as PTSD. Their current Phase 3 PTSD protocol (83) has\nused 75–125 mg of oral MDMA, given during standardized\npsychotherapy sessions for PTSD in 2–3 total sessions each\nspaced about a month apart. Three preparatory psychotherapy\nsessions without MDMA were administered prior to the dosing\nsessions to build rapport and set goals, and 3–4 sessions would\nfollow, for a total of 8–10 sessions.\nDuring MDMA treatment, feelings and emotions around\ntriggers could be explored in a manner similar to that done\nfor other unpleasant subjects such as trauma. The therapists\ncould assist the client in examining when and how they\nreact to a trigger, and if they wished to consider examining\nwhether they should be more open and accepting toward thosemaking the trigger sounds. It may also be possible to do real-\ntime exposure work to triggers, since MDMA can reduce the\notherwise overpowering aversive response that could interfere\nwith the therapy.\nAs with the PTSD studies, it will be critically important\nto have the 3–4 follow up sessions in order to integrate the\nexperience, build skills around what was learned, and help any\nclients that may not have experienced suﬃcient beneﬁt from\nthe experience. In many cases, it will likely be appropriate to\ncontinue regular psychotherapy and medication management\nwell beyond the 8–10 session series, in order to reinforce new\nhabits and ways of responding to things.\nIn terms of patient selection and inclusion criteria, we would\nadvise that adult patients be selected who have misophonia\naccording to the 2022 consensus deﬁnition (2), and that\nscore in clinically concerning range on a generally accepted\nmisophonia rating scale, so that symptom reduction can be\nmore systematically tracked over the course of treatment.\nHistorically, the most widely used rating scale has been\nthe Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (Johnson, available\nonline , however this is slowly falling out of favor. Newer rating\nscales such as the S-Five: Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome\nStudy (84), Misophonia Response Scale (85), the A-MISO-\nS (4), or the now revised version AMISOS-R (7), the Duke\nMisophonia Questionnaire (86), and MisoQuest (87) have made\nprogress toward having a fully validated, internally consistent\nmisophonia rating instrument, and may also be a good choice\nfor tracking progress.\nExclusions for participation would include all comorbid\ndisorders. To establish promising and accurate results on the\neﬀectiveness of MDMA on misophonia, it is important to\ncontrol for all of the possible confounding factors, including\npre-existing comorbid disorders. In future clinical practice,\nwe anticipate that misophonia and PTSD will be frequently\ntreated together and see no reason to oppose this, but for\npurposes of an initial study, would advise these be kept separate.\nOther exclusions would be any medical contraindication for\nreceiving MDMA, concurrent Bipolar 1 disorder, borderline\npersonality disorder, eating disorder with active purging, or\nactive substance abuse.\nGiven the highly relational nature of some misophonia\nsuﬀerers, it would also be advisable to develop protocols for a\nseparate couples therapy study, similar to the successful couples\nwork in which one member suﬀers from PTSD (69). Empathy,\nunderstanding, and forgiveness related to misophonia triggers\nbetween the couple could also be an area of focus.\nIn terms of risk to participants compared to the current\ntreatment protocol (i.e., for PTSD), we note again that\nmisophonia suﬀerers have high levels of neuroticism (64), and\nthat neuroticism corresponds to a higher risk (82) of having\nan unpleasant experience with MDMA. This could mean that\na higher proportion of misophones will experience a negative\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org"

MDMA\nhas already proven itself safe and eﬃcacious in other similar\ndisorders characterized by aberrant emotional and autonomic\nresponses, and we propose it is ready to also be tested on\nmisophonia symptoms, with a protocol analogous to the MAPS\nPhase 3 trials for PTSD.
