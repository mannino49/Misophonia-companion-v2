Regarding  comorbid  disorders,  studies  show  great  \nheterogeneity,  with  estimates  ranging  from  28–76%  of  comorbid  mental  disorders  and  approximately  25%  with  comorbid  physical  disor  ders.  The  \nexact  etiology  is  currently  not  well  studied.  Initial  neurophysiological  explanations  and  imaging  studies  point  to  a  specific  physiologi  cal  response  in  \nmisophonia  patients.  Although  many  case  reports  are  now  available,  and  diagnostic  criteria  and  measurement  tools  have  been  developed,  \nmisophonia  currently  does  not  represent  a  distinct  neurological,  audiological,  or  psychiatric  disorder  in  the  DSM-5  or  ICD-11.  \nJournal  of  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry  and  Psychotherapy  (2022),  1–11Summary:  Misophonia  describes  a  phenomenon  in  which  affected  children  and  adolescents  show  a  strong  negative  physiological  and  emotional  \nreaction  when  confronted  with  specific  auditory  (misophonic)  stimuli  (most  commonly  eating  or  breathing  noises).  Individual  studies  with  adults  \nalready  provide  prevalences  between  6  and  20%  in  various  (clinical)  samples,  whereby  the  representativeness  of  the  samples  in  most  studies  was  \nonly  given  to  a  very  limited  extent.  However,  the  first  manifestation  of  the  symptoms  is  in  more  than  80%  of  cases  in  childhood  and  adolescence,  \nwhich  is  why  this  age  group  should  be  given  special  attention.  With  regard  to  comorbid  disorders,  there  is  also  great  heterogeneity  with  estimates  of  \nbetween  28%  and  76%  for  comorbid  mental  disorders  and  around  25%  for  comorbid  physical  illnesses.  The  exact  etiology  has  not  yet  been  \nsufficiently  investigated.  First  neurophysiological  explanations  and  imaging  studies  point  to  a  specific  physiological  reaction  in  misophonia  patients.  \nAlthough  there  are  now  a  large  number  of  case  reports,  diagnostic  criteria  and  measuring  instruments  have  been  developed  and  the  first  cognitive-\nbehavioral  treatment  approaches  have  been  evaluated,  misophonia  still  does  not  represent  an  independent  neurological,  audiological  or  psychiatric  \ndisorder  in  the  DSM-5  or  the  ICD-11.\nMisophonia  in  Childhood  and  Adolescence:  A  Narrative  Review  \nAbstract:  Misophonia  describes  a  phenomenon  in  which  the  affected  children  and  adolescents  show  a  strong  negative  physiological  and  emo  \ntional  reaction  when  confronted  with  specific  (misophonic)  auditory  stimuli  (most  commonly  eating  or  breathing  sounds).  Several  studies  with  adults  \nyielded  prevalence  rates  between  6%  and  20%  in  various  (clinical)  samples,  but  the  representativeness  of  samples  was  largely  limited.  \nbackgroundMisophonia  in  \nchildren  and  adolescents:\nA  narrative  review\nhttps:// doi.org/ 10.1024/1422-4917/ a000885  The  term  \"misophonia\" (Greek  misos  =  hate,  phone  \n=  noise),  literally  \"hatred  of  sounds\",  describes  a  \nphenomenon  in  which  those  affected  show  a  negative  \nphysiological  and  emotional  reaction  when  confronted  \nwith  specific  auditory  stimuli  (Brout  et  al.,  2018;  Jager,  \nde  Koning,  Bost,  Denys  &  Vulink,  2020).  Although  \ninitial  studies  indicate  that  the  phenomenon  of  \nmisophonia  is  quite  widespread  in  the  general  \npopulation,  is  associated  with  considerable  physical  \nand  emotional  stress  and  occurs  for  most  of  those  \naffected  for  the  first  time  in  childhood,  it  has  so  far  received  little  attentionifound  in  the  diagnosis  and  care  of  mentally  ill  children  \nand  adolescents  (Claiborn,  Dozier,  Hart  &  Lee,  2020).  \nThe  aim  of  this  review  article  is  therefore  to  create  an  \noverview  of  the  symptoms,  course  and  treatment  \noptions  on  the  basis  of  a  selective  literature  search  in  \norder  to  sensitize  specialists  to  the  disorder.  In  \naddition  to  the  psychiatric  perspective,  misophonia  \nhas  received  attention  in  a  large  number  of  related  \ninterdisciplinary  research  areas,  which  has  led  to  an  \ninterdisciplinary  conceptualization  of  the  disorder  in  \nthe  literature.  However,  this  article  focuses  on  the  \npsychological  and  psychiatric  facets  of  the  disorder.Marc  Allroggen  and  Cedric  Sachser,  Elisa  Pfeiffer  \nhttps://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1024/1422-4917/a000885  -  Monday,  July  25,  2022  9:07:34  PM  -  IP  Address:73.164.63.26  \nMachine Translated by Google"

The  \nsound  pattern  and  the  triggering  reaction  are  very  \nunpleasant  for  those  affected\nAlthough  initial  studies  have  already  attempted  to  \ncharacterize  the  clinical  picture  of  the  disorder  in  terms  \nof  diagnostic  criteria  and  the  level  of  suffering  of  those  affectedperceived  as  more  aversive.  On  the  contrary,  sounds  \nare  perceived  as  less  aversive  by  young  children,  adults  \nwith  intellectual  disabilities  and  elderly  people  with  \ndementia  (Dozier,  2015a).  For  individuals  affected,  \nmisophonia  can  be  associated  with  significant  \npsychoemotional  and  social  stress,  a  reduction  in  \nfunctional  level  and  quality  of  life. The  syndrome  misophonia  was  first  conceptualized  in  \nthe  scientific  literature  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2001)  by  \nthe  Americans  Margaret  and  Pawel  Jastreboff,  who  are  \nknown  for  their  research  in  the  field  of  tinnitus  (Jastreboff,  \n1990).  The  authors  describe  neurological  similarities  to  \nthe  disorders  hyperacusis  (extreme  sensitivity  to  loud  \nnoises,  occurs  e.g.  in  small  children)  and  phonophobia  \n(phobic  fear  of  noises).It  should  be  noted  that  misophonia  has  not  been  \nrecognized  as  a  neurological,  audiological,  or  psychiatric  \ndisorder  to  date.  In  addition,  the  disorder  cannot  be  \nclassified  and  diagnosed  as  an  independent  disorder  \nusing  the  current  classification  systems.  A  detailed  \noverview  of  the  differentiation  of  psychiatric  disorders  can  \nbe  found  in  Schröder,  Vulink  and  Denys  (2013).  A  working  \ngroup  led  by  Arjan  Schröder  published  a  first  proposal  for  \npossible  diagnostic  criteria  in  2013  (Schröder  et  al.,  \n2013),  followed  by  those  of  Thomas  Doziers'  working  \ngroup  in  2017  (Dozier  &  Morrison,  2017;  German  overview  \nin  Spitczok,  by  Brinsinski,  Semmler,  Schüller  &  Heiden  \nrich,  2019).  The  criteria  according  to  Schröder  were  \nrevised  by  the  Jager  working  group  in  2020  on  the  basis  \nof  new  findings  and  are  therefore  the  most  up-to-date  \ncriteria  (see  presentation  of  the  criteria  in  Table  1).  All  \nconceptualisations  of  the  diagnostic  criteria  are  largely  \nbased  on  studies  with  young  adults.\nThose  who  reported  sensitivity  to  a  variety  of  sounds  \n(made  by  people  or  objects)  (e.g.,The  authors  noticed  that  individual  hyperacusis  patients  \nreacted  sensitively  to  a  certain  group  of  sounds,  \nregardless  of  the  loudness  or  other  physical  characteristics  \nof  the  sounds.  In  contrast  to  hyperacusis,  the  triggering  \nsounds  were  variable  in  this  subgroup  of  patients.\nWith  regard  to  stimuli  typical  of  misophonia,  the  \nauthors  were  able  to  show  in  a  current  study  that  almost  \nall  misophonia  patients  reported  eating  sounds  (96%)  \nand  nasal  or  breathing  sounds  (85%)  as  misophonic  \nstimuli,  which  is  why  these  special  sounds  were  included  \nin  the  criteria.  In  their  sample,  78%  of  patients  also  \nreported  nonauditory  stimuli  as  misophonic  triggers,  but  \nauditory  stimuli  are  categorized  as  primary  triggers.The  stimuli  perceived  as  aversive,  which  are  also  \ncalled  “triggers”  or  “misophonia  sounds”,  include  eating  \nsounds  (e.g.  swallowing,  chewing,  biting  into  an  apple),  \nnasal/breathing  sounds,  mouth  and  throat  sounds,  \nknocking  sounds,  rustling ,  room  noises  (e.g.  telephone  \nringing)  or  repetitive  movements  (e.g.  scratching;  \noverview:  Jager  et  al.,  2020;  Siepsiak  &  Dragan,  2019).  \nThe  ensuing  automatic  emotional  response  (also  called  \nthe  “misophonia  response”  or  “misophonic  response”)  \ncan  manifest  itself  in  a  variety  of  feelings,  such  as  anger,  \nrage,  fear,  and  disgust,  or  at  the  behavioral  level,  in  the  \nform  of  avoidance  and  a  desire  to  to  escape  the  situation  \n(fight-flight  response;  Brout  et  al.,  2018;  Wu,  Lewin,  \nMurphy  &  Storch,  2014).  In  a  current  Dutch  study  with  N  \n=  575  misophonia  patients  (mixed  children,  adolescents  \nand  adults),  the  authors  were  able  to  show  that  93.8%  \nirritability,  89.5%  anger,  64%  disgust  and  13.6%  other  \nemotional  reactions  (e.g.  sadness  or  loss  of  control )  \nexperience  (Jager  et  al.,  2020).

A  recent  study  of  people  who  self-\nreported  having  the  disease  misophonia  reported  a  \nmean  age  of  onset  of  12.61  years  (SD  =  7.46,  range  \n0–15;  Claiborn  et  al.,  2020);  About  80%  of  the  study  \nparticipants  stated  that  symptoms  started  before  the  \nage  of  15.  Age  and  gender  of  the  patients  had  no  \ninfluence  on  the  age  of  onset  (Claiborn  et  al.,  2020;  \nJager  et  al.,  2020),  but  earlier  onset  of  symptoms  \nwas  permanently  associated  with  stronger  symptoms  \n(Claiborn  et  al.,  2020).  A  recent  study  (Jager  et  al.,  \n2020)  on  a  clinical  utilization  population  who  presented  \nwith  their  misophonia  symptoms  (n=575  of  the  N=779  \npatients  met  the  authors'  misophonia  criteria,  69%  \nfemale,  Mage  =13.17  years),  was  able  to  show  that  \nmost  patients  reported  a  gradual  onset  of  symptoms  \nand  a  chronic  course.  However,  there  are  still  no  \nconcrete  studies  on  long-term  courses  (e.g.realm  of  the  compulsive  personality.

Previous  studies,  most  of  which  were  carried  \nout  with  university  students  or  tinnitus  patients,  report  \nvery  different  prevalence  rates  and  only  allow  a  few  \nconclusions  to  be  drawn  about  the  general  population.  \nFor  example,  a  study  with  N  =  438  students  (16%  male)  \nin  the  USA  reported  clinically  significant  symptoms  of  \nmisophonia  in  20%  of  the  study  participants  (Wu  et  al.,  \n2014).  Another  study  with  students  in  Great  Britain  found\nThe  studies  available  to  date  must  also  be  interpreted  \nwith  caution,  since  in  some  cases  different  diagnostic  \ncriteria  for  misophonia  were  used,  e.g.  In  some  cases,  \nthe  study  populations  were  very  different  and  only  very  \nsmall  numbers  of  cases  were  considered  (Palumbo,  \nAlsalman,  De  Ridder,  Song  &  Vanneste,  2018).There  are  studies  among  patients  with  tinnitus  that  \nassume  a  prevalence  of  misophonia  of  10  to  60%  \n(Hadjipavlou,  Baer,  Lau  &  Howard,  2008;  Sztuka,  Pospi  \nech,  Gawron  &  Dudek,  2010).  Both  the  Wu  et  al.  (2014)  \nand  the  study  by  Zhou,  Wu,  &  Storch  (2017)  showed  \nthat  anxiety  symptoms  mediated  the  relationship  \nbetween  misophonia  and  outbursts  of  anger.\nIn  recent  years,  some  functional  imaging  studies  have  \nalso  been  conducted  with  misophonia  patients  (Giorgi,  \n2015;  Kumar  et  al.,  2017;  Schröder,  San  Giorgi,  van  \nWingen,  Vulink  &  Denys,  2015;  Schröder  et  al.,  2019).  \nWhen  misophonic  stimuli  are  presented,  the  findings  \npredominantly  show  an  increased  activation  in  the  \nauditory  cortex  as  well  as  the  amygdala  and  otherSo  far,  there  are  only  a  few  studies  that  have  dealt  with  \npossible  neurophysiological  correlates  and  causes  of  \nmisophonia  (Brout  et  al.,  2018).\nhttps://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1024/1422-4917/a000885  -  Monday,  July  25,  2022  9:07:34  PM  -  IP  Address:73.164.63.26  \nThe  exact  etiology  of  misophonia  has  not  yet  been  \nsufficiently  studied  (Siepsiak  &  Dragan,  2019).Studies  measuring  skin  conductance  during  the  \npresentation  of  misophonic  triggers  have  shown  a  \nspecific  stress  response  to  misophonic  triggers  in  \npatients  with  misophonia  but  not  in  healthy  controls  \n(Edelstein  et  al.,  2013;  Kumar  et  al.,  2017).

However,  a  recent  \nstudy  did  not  find  any  differences  in  the  activation  of  \nthe  auditory  cortex  in  misophonia  patients  compared  to  \nhealthy  controls,  but  rather  a  stronger  activation  in  \nareas  associated  with  orofacial  movements.  These  \nfindings  are  linked  to  previous  clinical  findings  showing  \nthat  the  noise  of  eating  in  particular  is  perceived  as  \nunpleasant,  so  that  it  is  discussed  whether  increased  \nactivation  of  motor  neurons  could  play  a  role  in  the  \ndevelopment  of  misophonia  (Kumar  et  al.,  2021). .  \nFindings  on  structural  changes  in  the  white  matter  also  \nindicate  that  the  impaired  visual  perception  of  facial  \nexpressions  could  have  a  possible  role  in  the  \ndevelopment  of  misophonia  symptoms  (Eijsker,  \nSchröder,  Liebrand,  Smit,  van  Wingen  &  Denys,  2021).\nAccording  to  the  study  by  Claiborn  et  al.  (2020),  only  \n24.7%  of  those  affected  report  having  sought  treatment  \nbecause  of  their  symptoms.  A  bigpart  reports  little  or  no  improvement  in  symptoms  as  a  \nresult  of  treatment.  Counseling  or  talk  therapy  was  used  \nmost  frequently  (13.7%),  followed  by  treatment  through  \ncognitive  behavioral  therapy  (8.2%).  However,  the  \ntreatment  spectrum  covered  a  very  wide  range  from  \nhypnosis  (2.9%)  to  pharmacotherapy  (2.8%).  Talk  \ntherapy  was  associated  negatively  (b  =  0.93;  p  <  .001)  \nand  psychopharmacotherapy  positively  (b  =  -1.39;  p  <  \n.001)  with  symptom  reduction.  Outside  of  regular  \ntreatment,  the  most  common  coping  strategies  used  by  \npatients  with  misophonic  symptoms  include  listening  to  \nmusic  (99%),  avoiding/range  of  the  limbic  system  (Eijsker,  Schröder,  Smit,  van  \nWingen  &  Denys,  2021;  Giorgi,  2015;  Schröder  et  al.,  \n2015;  Schröder  et  al.,  2019).

The  sub-item  \"Target  group\"  \nshows  whether  the  inventory  can  also  be  used  with  \nchildren  and  young  people.  There  is  currently  no  \ninstrument  specifically  designed  for  children  and  young  \npeople.Leaving  the  situation  (99%)  or  making  noises  (86–\n77%;  Jager  et  al.,  2020).et  al.  (2017)  also  found  increased  activation  in  the  area  \nof  the  anterior  insular  cortex  (AIC),  an  area  associated  \nwith  directed  attention  to  stimuli  (salience),  when  \nmisophonic  triggers  were  presented.  In  addition,  there  \nwas  impaired  connectivity  of  the  AIC  with  medial  frontal,  \nmedial  parietal  and  temporal  regions.\nCurrent  studies  on  the  treatment  of  misophonia  \nmostly  only  include  uncontrolled  case  studies/case  \nseries  (Bernstein,  Angell  &  Dehle,  2013;  Dozier,  2015a;  \nHaq,  Al  resheed  &  Tu,  2020;  McGuire  et  al.,  2015;  \nPotgieter  et  al.,  2019;  Reid,  Guzick,  Gernand  &  Olsen,  \n2016),  which  is  why  no  specific  treatment  \nrecommendations  can  yet  be  made.  The  treatment  \napproaches  known  to  date  are  briefly  presented  below.\nFirst  studies  on  confrontation  therapies  with  \nmisophonia  patients  were  able  to  show  that  \nexposure  to  misophonia  noises  did  not  lead  to  \ndirect  habituation  (Frank  &  McKay,  2019),  which  \nis  why  the  authors  adapted  their  treatment  model  \nand  included  an  inhibitory  learning  model  in  the  \ntreatment.

So  far  \nthere  are  only  single  case  studies  on  the  pharmacological  treatment  \nof  misophonia,  e.g.  B.  with  antidepressants  (Sarigedik  &  Yurteri,  \n2021).

The  book  \n“Misophonia:  Lisa’s  anger  and  the  noises” (Seebeck  &  \nHomrighausen,  2020)  was  published  especially  for  children  and  \nadolescents  and  can  be  a  helpful  tool  for  psychoeducation  with  \naffected  children  and  adolescents.\nOther  possible  underlying  pathomechanisms  (e.g.  pathophysiological  \nprocesses,  the  influence  of  life  events,  the  frequency  and  intensity  \nof  exposure  to  trigger  noises)  as  well  as  protective  and  risk  factors  \nfor  the  (individual)  course  of  the  disorder  must  be  examined  more  \nclosely  in  order  to  be  able  to  determine  a  better  (differenttuations  as  well  as  with  the  described  noise  sensitivity  are  taken  \ninto  account.\norg/10.1177/1534650114566924  \nAt  the  current  time,  it  is  still  questionable  whether  misophonia  \nshould  be  understood  as  a  symptom  manifestation  of  other  \nunderlying  or  comorbid  diagnoses  or  should  be  considered  as  an  \nindependent  diagnosis  in  the  classification  systems  of  psychiatric  \ndisorders.\nJournal  of  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry  and  Psychotherapy  (2022),  1–11conclusionliterature\nfnins.2018.00036Alternative  treatment  models\nCavanna,  AE  &  Seri,  S.
