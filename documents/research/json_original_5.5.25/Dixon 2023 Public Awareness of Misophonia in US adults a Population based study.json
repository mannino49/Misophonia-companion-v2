The term misophonia was first \ncoined in 2001 (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ), and although \nformal diagnostic criteria have not yet been established, \nmisophonia has been increasingly identified in clinical set -\ntings (Jager et al., 2020 ). Further, research on misophonia \nhas spanned the fields of neuroscience, psychology, psy -\nchiatry, and audiology. Beyond recognition in clinical and \nscientific communities, misophonia has also gained the \nattention of laypersons through news outlets (e.g., Barrow \n2015 ; Fulton, 2019 ) and social media (e.g., Newcastle Uni -\nversity, 2017 ). Despite this growing recognition, the level \nof awareness of misophonia in the general population is \nlargely unknown, which has significant implications for the \nadvancement of misophonia and patient care.\nExtensive research has examined the role of public aware -\nness in the recognition and treatment of mental health dis -\norders and medical conditions, such as depression (Gabriel Introduction\nMisophonia is a disorder characterized by selective sensitiv -\nity to certain sounds (e.g., chewing, pen clicking), which are \nexperienced as unpleasant and accompanied by strong nega -\ntive emotional (e.g., irritation, anxiety), physical (e.g., ten -\nsion), and behavioral (e.g., avoidance of places) responses \n(Swedo et al., 2022 ).

Despite \ngreater recognition of misophonia over the last two decades, the extent of awareness of misophonia in the general public \nis unknown. Extensive research emphasizes the importance of public awareness in recognition and treatment of mental \ndisorders and medical conditions. Awareness of misophonia is important for the continued advancement of misophonia \nresearch and identification of individuals with misophonia. As an important first step, this study investigated the general \npublic’s understanding of misophonia. Data were collected through Ipsos KnowledgePanel, which maintains a large, \nprobability-based web panel designed to be representative of the United States. Panel members were invited to complete \na brief survey, and the final sample was comprised of 4,005 participants (51.5% female). A small portion of individuals \n(11.3%, n = 451) recognized misophonia. A multivariate binary logistic regression model revealed that individuals who \nwere female, younger, White/non-Hispanic, had a Bachelor’s degree or higher, or reported an annual income between \n$75,000 - $99,000 were significantly more likely to endorse misophonia recognition. Most participants who were familiar \nwith misophonia reported an accurate understanding about misophonia; yet, low level of knowledge. The internet was \nmost commonly identified as the primary information source. Findings highlight the low level of misophonia awareness \namong laypersons and emphasize the need to increase public knowledge of misophonia.\nKeywords  Misophonia · Awareness · Public · Layperson knowledge · Sound sensitivityAccepted: 13 December 2022\n© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science +Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022Public awareness of Misophonia in U.S. adults: a Population-based \nstudy\nLaura.

Mental health knowledge and awareness in \nthe general public have been associated with numerous pos -\nitive outcomes. For example, researchers have found greater \nawareness increases likelihood of disclosure to friends or \nfamily and employers (Henderson et al., 2017 ), facilitates \nhelp-seeking behaviors (Picco et al., 2018 ), improves sup -\nport (Picco et al., 2018 ), enhances treatment options (Jorm, \n2012 ), and predicts treatment utilization (Bonabi et al., \n2016 ). In addition, mental health-related knowledge has \nbeen shown to enhance acceptance (Henderson et al., 2012 ) \nand increase willingness to be in social contact with those \nstruggling from mental health problems (Evans-Lacko et al., \n2013 ) among laypersons. In contrast, less knowledge has \nbeen linked to stigmatizing attitudes (Buizza et al., 2017 ), \nprejudice (Foster et al., 2018 ), and delays in assessment and \ntreatment (Thornicroft, 2008 ).\nTo date, there are no known studies on public aware -\nness of misophonia; however, one relevant study examined \nuniversity instructors’ knowledge of misophonia. In this \nstudy, undergraduate faculty ( N = 686) responded to ques -\ntions that assessed awareness of misophonia (Porcaro et al., \n2019 ). The results indicated that 18.4% of participants had \nknowledge of misophonia; yet, most of these individuals \nwere unable to provide a definition. These findings are the \nfirst to suggest that awareness of misophonia is relatively \nlow – even among those with higher education levels and \nworking in an environment where misophonia may be par -\nticularly common and problematic (Wu et al., 2014 ; Zhou \net al., 2017 ).\nGiven the rising interest in misophonia, the investigation \nof public knowledge of misophonia is critical for informing \nthe next stages of education and advocacy. Increasing public \nknowledge is critical for facilitating help-seeking behaviors \nfor individuals and within communities. Additionally, wide -\nspread awareness has the potential to lend to greater avail -\nability of resources, changes in public policy, and support \nfor publicly funded research (Entwistle et al., 1998 ). Conse -\nquently, the purpose of this study was to further understand \nthe level of misophonia awareness in a nationally repre -\nsentative sample of U.S. adults. First, rates of recognition of misophonia were examined. In particular, we evaluated \nthe specific role of demographic characteristics in relation \nto misophonia recognition. Previous studies have demon -\nstrated certain demographic characteristics are associated \nwith recognition of mental health disorders; therefore, we \nhypothesized that younger age (Stewart et al., 2019 ), White/\nnon-Hispanic background (Dillenburger et al., 2013 ; Stew -\nart et al., 2019 ), higher level of education (Buizza et al., \n2017 ; Coles et al., 2013 ; Dillenburger et al., 2013 ; Stewart \net al., 2019 ), higher income (Stewart et al., 2019 ), and living \nin an urban area (Huang et al., 2019 ) would be unique pre -\ndictors of recognition of misophonia. Second, we explored \npersonal experience with misophonia (self or other) and \ninterest in learning more about misophonia. Lastly, features \nof misophonia knowledge, such as level of knowledge and \ninformation source, were investigated among individuals \nwho endorsed prior awareness of misophonia.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Sampling\nData collection was conducted by Ipsos KnowledgePanel \n(KnowledgePanel), which maintains the largest, web-based \npanel of adults in the United States (U.S.; Ipsos Public \nAffairs, n.d.). The panel is estimated to include 60,000 mem -\nbers. Individuals are recruited using address-based sam -\npling methodology based on the latest Delivery Sequence \nFile from the U.S. Postal Service. This probability-based \nsampling includes all known households and facilitates the \nrecruitment of a nationally representative sample, includ -\ning hard-to-reach individuals. For instance, individuals who \ndo not have access to the internet are provided with a web-\nenabled device. Individuals agree to be a part of the panel \nand receive invitations to complete individual surveys. Par -\nticipation in surveys is voluntary, and a modest incentive \nprogram is used to encourage ongoing participation as a \npanel member. Consent is implicit in the completion and \nreturn of the survey.\nIn addition to the aforementioned procedures that Knowl -\nedgePanel uses to secure and maintain a nationally repre -\nsentative sample, KnowledgePanel uses sample weighting \nto further ensure that samples are representative of the U.S. \npopulation. Study-specific post-stratification weights are \napplied to survey data based on geodemographic bench -\nmarks from the latest U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Popu -\nlation Survey. This weight process included gender by age \ngroup, race/ethnicity, census region, education, and house -\nhold income. This weighting addresses any potential over- \nor undersampling of certain subgroups and yields a reliable \nestimate that reflects the parameters of the U.S. population.\n1 3"

      "text": "Current PsychologyParticipants\nA total of 6,688 individuals were invited to complete this \nsurvey, and the final sample included 4,005 individu -\nals (59.9% response rate). Approximately half the sample \nwas female (51.5%) and the mean age was 48.32 years \n(SD = 17.76). Weighted demographic characteristics are \nreported in Table 1.\nProcedure\nThe questions developed for the current study were \nincluded in a larger project investigating the prevalence of \nmisophonia in the general population (Dixon et al., 2022 ). \nThe survey was administered to randomly selected Knowl -\nedgePanel members aged 18 and older residing in the U.S. A pretest of the survey items was conducted in January of \n2022, and the survey was conducted between January 21, \n2022 and February 6, 2022.\nDemographic characteristics were recorded by Knowl -\nedgePanel, and participants responded to up to seven \nquestions that evaluated awareness and knowledge of \nmisophonia. First, recognition of the term misophonia was \nassessed (“Prior to this survey, had you heard of the term \nmisophonia?”). Next, participants received a brief definition \nof misophonia based on the consensus definition (Swedo et \nal., 2022 ):\nMisophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to \nspecific sounds (e.g., chewing, slurping, breathing, \npen clicking, typing) or stimuli associated with the \nsounds (e.g., visual triggers). Sounds are experienced \nas unpleasant or distressing and tend to evoke strong \nnegative emotional (e.g., anger, anxiety), physical \n(e.g., tension, sweating), and behavioral (e.g., agita -\ntion, avoidance) responses. These intense negative \nreactions are not seen in most other people and may \ncontribute to suffering, distress, and/or life impair -\nment. This disorder can be present in people with \nor without normal hearing, and symptoms are not \nexplained by other disorders, such as autism spectrum \ndisorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\nThis definition was provided to ensure that participants had \nan accurate definition of misophonia and could respond to \nthe subsequent questions. Following this information, per -\nsonal experience with misophonia was evaluated by assess -\ning if they identified as having misophonia (yes/no) or knew \nsomeone who had misophonia (yes/no). In addition, partici -\npants rated their interest in learning more about misophonia \non a 5-point Likert-type scale from “very uninterested” to \n“very interested.”\nParticipants who initially endorsed that they had heard \nof misophonia received three additional questions to further \nassess misophonia knowledge. With regard to the provided \ndefinition of misophonia, participants were asked “does this \ndescription match your understanding of misophonia?” and \ncould respond “yes”, “no”, “somewhat”, or “did not have \nan understanding of misophonia.” Next, level of familiar -\nity or knowledge of misophonia was rated on a 5-point \nLikert-type scale from “not at all familiar” to “extremely \nfamiliar”. Lastly, participants were asked to identify their \nprimary source of information on misophonia, and several \noptions were listed, including personal experience (e.g., self \nor someone I know), media (e.g., news article, television, \nTV , radio), social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, \nTikTok), health education (e.g., school, workshops), doc -\ntor or healthcare provider (e.g., audiologist, mental health), Table 1  Demographic characteristics ( N = 4,005)\n% (n)\nGender\n Male 48.5 (1942)\n Female 51.5 (2063)\nAge Group\n 18–24 8.4 (335)\n 25–34 19.5 (782)\n 35–44 17.9 (718)\n 45–54 14.0 (559)\n 55–64 18.0 (720)\n 65–74 14.8 594)\n 75+ 7.4 (295)\nRace/Ethnicity\n White, non-Hispanic 62.5 (2,505)\n Black, non-Hispanic 12.0 (480)\n Other, non-Hispanic 7.2 (287)\n Hispanic 16.9 (676)\n 2 + races, non-Hispanic 1.4 (58)\nEducation\n <High School 9.6 (384)\n High school graduate (high school\n diploma or GED equivalent)28.3 (1133)\n Some college 27.1 (1084)\n ≥Bachelor’s degree 35.0 (1403)\nHousehold Income\n < $25,000 12.8 (513)\n $25,000 to $49,999 17.0 (682)\n $50,000 to $74,999 16.3 (654)\n $75,000 to $99,999 13.2 (527)\n $100,000 to $149,999 17.9 (717)\n ≥ $150,000 22.8 (911)\nMetropolitan Area\n Non-Metro 13.3 (534)\n Metro 86.7 (3471)\nNote.

Third, multiple binary \nlogistic regression analyses were conducted to examine \nthe separate and unique roles of demographic characteris -\ntics in predicting recognition of misophonia. To examine \nthe effects of demographic characteristics on recognition \nof misophonia, each demographic variable (age, gender, \nrace/ethnicity, education, household income, metropolitan \narea) was entered separately into a binary logistic regres -\nsion model. Then, all demographic variables were simulta -\nneously entered into one binary logistic regression model. \nIn these models, age was a continuous variable, gender and \nmetropolitan status were binary variables, and race/ethnic -\nity, education, and income were categorical variables. For \neach categorical variable, simple contrasts were conducted \nwith the first reference group.

However, unlike this study, higher levels of \nincome were not uniformly predictive of misophonia rec -\nognition in the current study. In the full model, those in the \nmiddle household income category of $75,000 - $99,999, \nhad a 57.3% greater likelihood of recognizing misophonia \ncompared to the reference group ( < $25,000).\nUnexpectedly, metropolitan status was not a significant \npredictor, which is inconsistent with research showing \nsignificantly lower recognition of mental health disorders \n(Huang et al., 2019 ) and limited access to health information \n(Chen et al., 2019 ) in rural areas. One possible explanation \nis that research shows that the internet and social media are \ncommon sources for health and medical information (Hesse \net al., 2005 ), which improves access of information. How -\never, quality of information warrants consideration as phy -\nsicians are rated as the most trusted sources of information \namong patients (Hesse et al., 2005 ), and low health literacy \nhas been associated with high rates of using social media \nor celebrity blogs/webpages for health information (Chen \net al., 2018 ). Given that individuals in rural areas have less \naccess to specialists (Chen et al., 2019 ), additional research \nis recommended to identify potential disparities in misopho -\nnia (mis)information between rural and urban areas.\nAltogether, these data provide further support for the \nlink between demographic characteristics and mental health \nawareness. In terms of implications, these findings suggest \nthat awareness campaigns may need to deploy specific strat -\negies to reach groups with lower recognition of misophonia, \nsuch as men, older adults, ethnic minority groups, high and \nlow household incomes, and lower education levels. Pre -\nvious research suggests these groups are often affected by \nhealth disparities, and factors such as public stigma and low \nmental health literacy are significant barriers to treatment \n(Kantor et al., 2017 ) across these sociodemographic groups, \nincluding minorities (Pérez-Flores & Cabassa, 2021 ) and \nolder adults (Lavingia et al., 2020 ). Consequently, the next \nsteps of increasing awareness should consider specific strat -\negies for engaging these groups. For instance, partnering Varying degrees of familiarity or knowledge of misopho -\nnia were reported, with most participants reporting they \nwere “slightly” familiar (45.3%) or “somewhat” familiar \n(28.3%). Regarding participants’ primary source of infor -\nmation on misophonia, the most common source was the \ninternet, such as Google or Wikipedia (32.3%), followed by \npersonal experiences (19.9%), media outlets (13.2%; e.g., \nnews article, radio), health education (11.4%; e.g., school), \nand social media (6.8%). Interestingly, a small portion of the \nsample identified misophonia-specific materials (6.3%; e.g., \nmisophonia website) or health care professionals (4.7%) as \nthe primary source of information.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study to evaluate misophonia awareness and \nknowledge in a representative sample of adults in the U.S. \nThe results provide an initial foundation for understanding \nthe level of misophonia awareness and knowledge in the \ngeneral population, which is a critical step for advancing \nresearch and facilitating the identification and treatment of \nindividuals with misophonia.\nOverall, a small portion of the full sample reported \nrecognition of misophonia.

      "text": "Current PsychologyThe final aim of this study was the examination of features \nof misophonia among individuals who recognized misopho -\nnia. These results revealed that understanding of misopho -\nnia was largely consistent with current scientific and clinical \nconceptualization. Further, the majority of participants \nreported moderate levels of misophonia knowledge. As a \nnext step, questionnaires evaluating knowledge of misopho -\nnia symptoms, causes, and treatment options may be help -\nful for shedding light on gaps in information and potential \nmisconceptions associated with misophonia that could be \nclarified through awareness campaigns. Regarding pri -\nmary sources of misophonia information, individuals com -\nmonly identified the internet, personal experience, media, \nand health education. This is consistent with recent studies \nshowing that many individuals receive medical information \nfrom online sources (Hesse et al., 2005 ). Although social \nmedia can provide an easily accessible and cost-efficient \nplatform for health information (Zhou et al., 2018 ), it is \nalso associated with greater propagation of health misinfor -\nmation (Suarez-Lledo & Alvarez-Galvez, 2021 ) and may \nperpetuate stigmatizing attitudes (Devendorf et al., 2020 ). \nEfforts to improve misophonia awareness should carefully \nconsider how information is disseminated through differ -\nent sources. For instance, increasing healthcare providers’ \nknowledge and communication of misophonia with patients \nmay be a critical next step given that misophonia is a rel -\natively new condition and greater trust is associated with \nhealth information provided by physicians (Hesse et al., \n2005 ). Consequently, it is important for stakeholders to take \nan active role in distributing accurate misophonia informa -\ntion (e.g., Devendorf et al., 2020 ), particularly in these early \nphases of dissemination.\nDespite the novel contributions of this study, several \nlimitations warrant mention. First, the findings are thought \nto represent adults in the U.S.; however, different patterns \nof misophonia awareness would likely be observed in other \ncountries (Yu et al., 2020 ). In addition, these data represent \ncurrent awareness and knowledge of misophonia; however, \nreplication and extension of this study in the next 5–10 \nyears would be helpful for understanding the continued \nexpansion of misophonia knowledge. Second, despite the \nlarge, representative sample, certain group level inferences \nmay have been limited by the small portion of individuals \nreporting misophonia recognition and knowledge. Third, \nalthough participants received a definition of misophonia \nto inform responses to subsequent questions, it is possible \nthat participants may have conflated misophonia with other \nsound sensitivities (e.g., hyperacusis). Lastly, this study was \nrestricted by the small number of survey items, which limits \nthe scope of the data. For instance, the item assessing inter -\nest in learning more about misophonia was not contextu -\nalized, nor was the importance or value of learning about with key community figures for the development of cultur -\nally-sensitive community-focused campaigns can increase \nknowledge and positive beliefs about mental health dis -\norders and treatment options (Abotsie et al., 2020 ; Jorm, \n2012 ). Additional work is needed to apply the literature base \non increasing mental health awareness to misophonia.\nIn terms of our exploratory analyses, 13.2% of the full \nsample reported knowing someone with misophonia and \n7.5% identified as having misophonia based on the defini -\ntion of misophonia. These results are not diagnostic; how -\never, they illustrate that upon receiving information about \nmisophonia, a small portion of individuals connected these \nsymptoms to someone in their life. This knowledge may \nrepresent an important first step as awareness of symptoms \nis a critical first step for receiving treatment (Jorm, 2012 ). \nInterestingly, there was a discrepancy between recognition \nof the term “misophonia” and personal contact with miso -\nphonia. Specifically, a small portion of individuals had not \nheard of the term misophonia, but identified as having miso -\nphonia or reported knowing someone with misophonia after \nreceiving the definition of misophonia. One possible expla -\nnation for this result is that laypersons may be familiar with \nmisophonia symptoms, but may not be familiar with the \nterm misophonia or may not be able to distinguish symp -\ntoms from other syndromes with similar features, such as \ntinnitus, autism spectrum disorder, phonophobia, and hyper -\nacusis. However, these results may suggest that merely pro -\nviding the clinical definition facilitated increased awareness \nof misophonia. Additional research is needed to further elu -\ncidate layperson recognition of terminology and knowledge \nof the symptoms of misophonia and closely connected dis -\norders (e.g., Furnham & Anthony, 2010 ; Jorm et al., 2006 ). \nFor instance, in addition to assessing recognition, it may be \nbeneficial to provide definitions and evaluate respondents’ \nability to identify and distinguish between disorders. With \nregard to interest in learning more about misophonia, a size -\nable portion of the sample indicated some level of interest, \nsuggesting that public awareness campaigns may be suc -\ncessful in outreach and increasing misophonia knowledge. \nNevertheless, a portion of the sample indicated little or no \ninterest in learning more about misophonia. Without addi -\ntional information, it is difficult to interpret this lack of \ninterest; however, it would not be expected that everyone \nin the general public would have a strong level of inter -\nest in obtaining additional information on misophonia. For \ninstance, it is possible that these individuals were apathetic \ndue to competing areas of interest and/or the absence of \ncompelling information on the impact of misophonia at the \nsocietal and personal level (V on Wagner et al., 2009 ). Future \nresearch exploring determinants of interest in misophonia \nknowledge may be advantageous for understanding how to \nimprove the dissemination of information.\n1 3"

Future studies \nincorporating comprehensive surveys, vignettes, and inter -\nviews are needed to more thoroughly understand public \nperceptions of misophonia, particularly as information on \nmisophonia continues to grow.\nThrough past research, the importance and value of \nawareness, and its effect on positive societal outcomes for \nmental health issues, have become readily apparent (e.g., \nEntwistle et al., 1998 ). The current study provides evidence \nthat awareness of misophonia is currently low in the gen -\neral population; yet, knowledge appeared to be accurate \namong the small portion of individuals who have heard of \nmisophonia. Furthermore, these findings identify certain \ndemographic groups that are less likely to be familiar with \nmisophonia and may need to be targeted in healthcare set -\ntings and through community-based campaigns.

Consequently, such efforts may serve as poten -\ntial next steps for improving knowledge of misophonia \namong the general population, at-risk communities, and \npotential providers. Cumulatively, the results are critical \nfor understanding current levels of public awareness and \nare important for informing the next stages of advocacy for \nmisophonia.\nAuthor contributions  LJD : Conceptualization, Methodology, Inves -\ntigation; Writing – Original Draft; Writing – Reviewing & Editing, \nProject Administration, Funding Acquisition, Supervision.
