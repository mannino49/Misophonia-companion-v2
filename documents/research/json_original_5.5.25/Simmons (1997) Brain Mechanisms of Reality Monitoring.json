      "text": "Review\nBrain  Mechanisms  of  Reality\nMonitoring\nJon  S.  Simons,1,*Jane  R.  Garrison,1and  Marcia  K.  Johnson2\nReality  monitoring  processes  are  necessary  for  discriminating  between  inter-\nnally  generated  information  and  information  that  originated  in  the  outside\nworld.  They  help  us  to  identify  our  thoughts,  feelings,  and  imaginations,  and\nto  distinguish  them  from  events  we  may  have  experienced  or  have  been  told\nabout  by  someone  else.  Reality  monitoring  errors  range  from  confusions\nbetween  real  and  imagined  experiences,  that  are  byproducts  of  normal  cogni-\ntion,  to  symptoms  of  mental  illness  such  as  hallucinations.  Recent  advances\nsupport  an  emerging  neurocognitive  characterization  of  reality  monitoring  that\nprovides  insights  into  its  underlying  operating  principles  and  neural  mecha-\nnisms,  the  differing  ways  in  which  impairment  may  occur  in  health  and  disease,\nand  the  potential  for  rehabilitation  strategies  to  be  devised  that  might  help\nthose  who  experience  clinically  signi ﬁcant  reality  monitoring  disruption.\nHow  Do  We  Know  What  Is  Real?\nThinking  back  over  your  life,  you  can  often  ﬁnd  yourself  mentally  transported  back  in  time,\nreliving  a  past  episode,  sometimes  in  vivid  detail.  Except  –  how  do  you  know  that  you  were\nactually  there  when  the  event  originally  took  place?  How  can  you  be  sure  that  you  are\nremembering  a  faithful  representation  of  what  happened,  as  opposed  to  an  event  you  might\nhave  previously  imagined,  or  a  story  told  to  you  by  someone  else?  In  short,  how  do  you\ndetermine  whether  your  memories  are  real?\nOne  prominent  theory,  the  Source  Monitoring  Framework,  proposes  that  there  are  decision\nprocesses  involved  in  making  attributions  about  the  origin  of  information  that  comes  to  mind,\nincluding  discriminating  information  that  was  generated  by  internal  cognitive  functions,  such  as\nthought  and  imagination,  from  information  that  was  derived  from  the  outside  world  by  per-\nceptual  processes  (‘reality  monitoring ’  [1,2]).  According  to  this  framework,  memories  do  not\ncontain  propositional  tags  that  directly  specify  their  source.  Instead,  we  make  attributions  about\nthe  origin  of  a  mental  experience  by  considering  its  features  in  light  of  assumptions  about  the\ncharacteristics  that  tend  to  be  associated  with  various  sources.  For  example,  a  person  might\ninfer  that  an  apparent  ‘memory ’  rich  in  visuoperceptual  detail  is  likely  to  be  real  (‘I  can  remember\nwhat  the  dentist ’s  ofﬁce  looked  like ’  [3])  whereas  one  comprising  mainly  traces  of  internally\ngenerated  thoughts  might  instead  have  been  imagined  (‘I  could  remember  I  had  a  very  speci ﬁc\nreason  for  making  the  association ’;  ‘I  made  the  decision  by  knowing  what  my  train  of  thought\nwas  during  the  exercise ’  [4]).\nReality  monitoring  errors  tend  to  involve  misidentifying  internally  generated  events  as  being  real,\nfor  example  misattributing  particularly  vivid  imaginations  to  perception,  or  assuming  that  the\nabsence  of  memory  for  cognitive  operations  indicates  that  a  memory  is  unlikely  to  have  been\nself-generated  [4],  although  misattributions  in  the  other  direction  also  occur,  such  as  in\ncryptomnesia  [5].  Similarity  between  potential  sources  increases  the  likelihood  of  source  errors\n[6].  For  example,  misattribution  errors  are  more  common  for  auditory  than  visual  stimuli,Trends\nMounting  evidence  identi ﬁes  anterior\nprefrontal  cortex  as  playing  a  key  role\nin  reality  monitoring,  the  ability  to  dis-\ntinguish  internally  from  externally  gen-\nerated  information.\nIndividual  differences  in  reality\nmonitoring  performance  in  healthy\nvolunteers  are  associated  with  varia-\nbility  in  functional  activity  and  structural\nmorphology  in  this  region  of  the  brain.\nDifferences  are  also  seen  in  clinical\nconditions  such  as  schizophrenia,  in\nwhich  people  sometimes  experience\ndisturbed  awareness  of  what  is  real.\nDysfunction  in  anterior  prefrontal  cor-\ntex  increases  vulnerability  to  misiden-\ntify  internally  generated  information  as\nexternal  in  origin,  providing  a  possible\nneurocognitive  basis  for  psychiatric\nsymptoms  such  as  hallucinations.\n1Department  of  Psychology,  University\nof  Cambridge,  Cambridge,  UK\n2Department  of  Psychology,  Yale\nUniversity,  New  Haven,  CT,  USA\n*Correspondence:\njss30@cam.ac.uk  (J.S.

      "text": "perhaps  because  ‘inner  speech ’  and  real  speech  tend  to  be  more  similar  than  visual  imagery\nand  actual  visual  perceptions  and,  hence,  are  more  vulnerable  to  confusion  [7].  It  is  important  to\nnote  that  the  features  that  are  activated  when  a  ‘target ’  memory  is  cued  are  determined  by\nprocesses  engaged  during  encoding  of  the  event  (e.g.,  the  quality  of  feature  binding),  during  the\ninterval  between  the  initial  event  and  the  act  of  ‘remembering ’  (e.g.,  the  number  of  reactiva-\ntions),  and  during  retrieval  (e.g.,  the  cue  eliciting  the  memory).  In  addition,  features  from  other\nevents  can  be  activated  at  any  point,  potentially  inﬂuencing  the  characteristics  of  the  remem-\nbered  event  [8].  In  addition  to  the  phenomenal  qualities  of  mental  experiences,  reality  monitor-\ning  may  also  involve  explicit  retrieval  of  supporting  or  conﬂicting  information,  and  may  be\ninﬂuenced  by  prior  knowledge,  beliefs,  and  motives  [9].  Thus,  there  are  multiple  factors\noperating  during  encoding  and  retrieval,  as  well  as  in  the  intervening  period,  that  can  produce\nsource  misattributions  in  healthy  individuals,  and  multiple  ways  that  processes  can  be  dis-\nrupted  in  clinical  populations.\nIn  the  past  few  years  a  number  of  laboratories  around  the  world  have  explored  the  brain\nmechanisms  underlying  reality  monitoring  processes  using  cognitive  neuroscience  methods\nincluding  functional  brain  imaging  of  healthy  volunteers  and  studies  of  neurological,  psychiatric,\nand  developmental  disorders,  as  well  as  of  normal  aging  [10].  The  aim  has  been  to  understand\nhow  the  brain  supports  our  capacity  to  determine  the  sources  of  mental  experiences,  including\ndistinguishing  what  is  real  from  what  we  have  imagined,  an  ability  that  is  vital  for  maintaining\nconﬁdence  in  our  memories,  and  in  understanding  ourselves  as  individuals  in  the  world  with  a\npast  and  a  future.  In  characterizing  how  these  processes  might  be  instantiated  in  the  brain,  we\ncan  better  understand  the  way  in  which  they  may  break  down  in  disorders  such  as  schizo-\nphrenia,  in  which  a  person ’s  relation  to  reality  can  be  altered  in  ways  that  disrupt  their  everyday\nfunctioning.\nAnterior  Prefrontal  Cortex  (PFC)  and  Reality  Monitoring\nNeuropsychological  and  neuroimaging  studies  have  identi ﬁed  a  network  of  brain  regions\ninvolved  in  the  recollection  of  source  information,  which  include  prefrontal,  medial  temporal,\nand  parietal  cortices  [10 –12].  In  broad  terms,  regions  of  PFC  are  thought  to  provide  cognitive\ncontrol  over  the  encoding  and  retrieval  of  feature  representations  that  are  bound  together  in  a\nspatial  frame  by  the  hippocampus  and  further  integrated  by  parietal  cortex  into  a  ﬁrst-person\nperspective  that  supports  the  subjective  experience  of  remembering  [9,13] .  The  role  of  the  PFC\nappears  to  be  particularly  crucial  for  source  memory,  and  lesions  to  the  frontal  lobes  typically\ncause  severe  difﬁculties  with  the  recollection  of  such  contextual  details  even  when  old/new  item\nrecognition  is  unimpaired  [14,15] .  Distinct  prefrontal  regions  may  make  separable  functional\ncontributions  to  source  memory  [11],  with  ventrolateral  PFC  subregions  linked  to  the  speci ﬁ-\ncation  of  retrieval  cues  and  the  maintenance  of  retrieved  information,  and  the  dorsolateral  PFC\nexhibiting  activity  during  post-retrieval  monitoring  [16 –18].\nOne  region  that  has  emerged  as  playing  a  key  role  in  reality  monitoring  is  the  anterior  PFC,  an\narea  right  at  the  front  of  the  brain  that,  in  relative  terms,  is  roughly  twice  as  large  in  the  human\nbrain  than  in  even  the  great  apes  [19].  It  has  lower  cellular  density  and  higher  dendritic\ncomplexity  than  comparable  cortical  regions  [20],  and  is  thought  to  be  among  the  last  areas\nto  achieve  myelination  [21],  enabling  nerve  cells  to  transmit  information  more  rapidly  and\nfacilitating  more  complex  cognitive  abilities.  As  such,  although  the  functions  performed  by  this\narea  are  not  well  understood,  they  have  generally  been  considered  likely  to  be  among  the\n‘higher ’  levels  of  human  complex  cognition  [21 –24].  The  role  played  by  the  anterior  PFC  in\nmemory  has  been  difﬁcult  to  characterize.  Several  neuroimaging  experiments  published  in  the\nearly  2000s  reported  activation  in  this  region  during  the  recollection  of  source  details\n[16,18,25,26] ,  but  this  was  not  consistently  observed  [17,27,28] .  An  absence  of  anterior\nPFC  activity  could  of  course  always  be  attributable  to  insuf ﬁcient  experimental  power  or  to\nTrends  in  Cognitive  Sciences,  June  2017,  Vol.  21,  No.  6  463"

Although  there  is  some  variability  in  the  patterns  of  activity\nelicited  by  such  tasks,  these  studies  have  consistently  identi ﬁed  the  medial  aspect  of  the\nanterior  PFC  in  particular  as  exhibiting  differential  activity  during  the  retrieval  of  internal  versus\nexternal  aspects  of  context  (Figure  2).  For  example,  medial  anterior  PFC  responses  distinguish\nrecollection  of  the  encoding  task  undertaken  compared  to  remembering  where  on  the  screen\n[29 –31]  or  when  in  time  [32,33]  stimuli  were  presented,  or  remembering  the  size  in  which  they\nwere  displayed  [25,34] .  The  same  region  is  involved  in  remembering  whether  verbal  phrases\nwere  previously  presented  in  full  on  the  screen  (e.g.,  ‘bacon  and  eggs ’),  or  whether  a  word  was\nmissing  which  participants  needed  to  imagine  (e.g.,  ‘bacon  and  ?’)  to  complete  the  phrase\nStudy phase Test phase\nLiving/nonliving?\nLiving/nonliving?Pleasant/unpleasant?Pleasantness task before?\nBigger before?\nGirl-boy\nMan-carThe man drove the\nThe girl loved the boy\nRomeoSubject\nExperimenter\nRock and rollRomeo and ?1,Self; 2 experimenter\n1,Self; 2 experimenterRock\nFigure  1.

      "text": "themselves  [30,35] .  Likewise,  medial  anterior  PFC  is  differentially  engaged  during  recollection\nof  whether  a  visual  object  was  previously  seen  or  imagined  by  participants  [36],  as  well  as  when\njudging  whether  oneself  or  another  person  performed  a  particular  action  with  stimuli  [37 –39].\nThe  sensitivity  of  this  region  to  reality  monitoring  distinctions  is  apparent  regardless  of  whether\nwords,  faces,  or  objects  are  being  remembered  [29,32,34,36] ,  suggesting  that  the  effect  is\nindependent  of  stimulus  type.  Moreover,  medial  anterior  activation  has  been  observed  irre-\nspective  of  whether  the  ‘internal ’  or  ‘external ’  condition  is  associated  with  lower  recollection\naccuracy  and  longer  response  times,  or  vice  versa,  or  whether  such  behavioral  factors  are\nmatched  between  conditions  [29,32] ,  suggesting  that  an  account  in  terms  of  differential  task\ndifﬁculty  is  unlikely  to  be  sufﬁcient.  Possible  explanations  of  the  observed  activity  include  that\nmedial  anterior  PFC  represents  records  of  cognitive  operations  involved  in  self-generation,  or  is\ninvolved  in  self-referential  processing  or  self-representation,  or  that  the  region  operates  as  a\ngateway,  biasing  attention  between  self-generated  and  externally  generated  information,\nirrespective  of  whether  that  information  is  experienced  currently  or  in  the  past  [21,40] .\nNot  everyone  exhibits  perfect  reality  monitoring  performance,  of  course.  Performance  varies\nconsiderably  even  in  apparently  healthy  individuals,  with  some  people  reliably  able  to  distin-\nguish  internally  from  externally  generated  stimuli  whereas  others  perform  closer  to  chance\nlevels  [41].  Consistent  with  the  functional  neuroimaging  evidence  discussed  above,  recent\nresearch  points  to  these  individual  differences  as  having  a  speci ﬁc  brain  structural  basis  in  the\nmedial  PFC.  One  structural  landmark  in  this  region  of  the  brain  that  exhibits  considerable\nmorphological  variability  within  the  general  population  is  the  paracingulate  sulcus  (PCS),  which\nlies  dorsal  and  parallel  to  the  cingulate  sulcus  (Figure  3).  The  PCS,  which  is  prominent  in  roughly\nhalf  of  the  normal  population,  is  a  tertiary  sulcus,  one  of  the  last  structural  folds  to  develop\nbefore  birth  and,  due  to  a  combination  of  genetic  and  environmental  inﬂuences,  varies\nconsiderably  in  size  between  individuals  [42].  This  brain  structure  variation  appears  to  be\nlinked  to  reality  monitoring  ability:  healthy,  apparently  cognitively  intact,  adults  whose  MRI\nscans  indicate  bilateral  absence  of  the  PCS  are  signi ﬁcantly  less  accurate  in  reality  monitoring\ndecisions  than  people  with  a  prominent  PCS  on  at  least  one  side  of  the  brain  [41].  PCS\nreductions  are  typically  associated  with  increased  grey  matter  volume  in  the  surrounding\nanterior  cingulate  cortex  [43]  and,  consistent  with  this  observation,  voxel-based  analyses\nreveal  that  reality  monitoring  performance  correlates  negatively  with  medial  PFC  volume\n[41].  Reduced  sulcal  folding  and  increased  surrounding  cortical  volume  may  reﬂect  weakened\nlocal  and  long-range  connectivity,  according  to  theories  of  morphogenesis  [44,45] .  These\nﬁndings  thus  suggest  an  explanation  for  individual  differences  in  reality  monitoring  ability  as\nreﬂecting,  in  part,  variations  in  connectivity  between  the  medial  PFC  and  other  cortical  regions\ninvolved  in  processing  the  sensory/perceptual  and  other  features  that  constitute  our  memories.\nFigure  2.

      "text": "Reality  Monitoring  in  Schizophrenia\nOne  of  the  applications  of  the  work  seeking  to  characterize  the  brain  mechanisms  of  reality\nmonitoring  has  been  to  inform  understanding  of  the  cognitive  dysfunction  seen  in  clinical\nconditions  such  as  schizophrenia.  Although  schizophrenia  can  vary  in  its  presentation,  among\nthe  positive  symptoms  often  observed  are  hallucinations,  such  as  hearing  voices  when  none\nare  present.  For  example,  a  person  with  schizophrenia  might  imagine  a  voice  conveying  a\nspeci ﬁc  message,  and  misidentify  that  voice  as  being  real,  coming  from  another  person.\nHallucinations  also  occur  in  other  psychiatric  conditions  including  bipolar  disorder,  major\ndepressive  disorder,  borderline  or  schizotypal  personality  disorder,  post-traumatic  stress\ndisorder,  and  dissociative  identity  disorder  [46 –48],  but  affect  between  60%  and  80%  of\npatients  with  a  schizophrenia  diagnosis  [49,50] .  Auditory  and  visual  hallucinations  are  the\nmost  common  forms,  with  a  prevalence  of  around  59%  and  27%  in  schizophrenia,  respectively\n[51],  but  olfactory,  tactile,  somatic,  and  gustatory  hallucinations  have  also  been  reported\n[52 –54].  Activity  associated  with  hallucinations  is  often  observed  in  sensory  processing  areas,\nsuch  as  the  superior  temporal  gyrus  during  auditory  hallucinations  and  extrastriate  cortex\nduring  visual  hallucinations  [55],  suggesting  that  separable  modality-speci ﬁc  impairments\ncontribute  to  different  types  of  hallucinations  across  patients.  One  possibility  is  that  halluci-\nnations  primarily  reﬂect  unusually  vivid  internally  generated  experiences  represented  in  one  or\nmore  of  these  modality-speci ﬁc  processing  areas,  experiences  that  are  so  vivid  that  they  seem\nto  be  external  events.  In  addition,  it  is  possible  that  hallucinations  may  in  part  result  from  a  more\ncentral  difﬁculty  in  discriminating  between  perceived  and  imagined  information,  perhaps\n0.90\n0.80\n0.70\n0.60Accuracy\nProminent le/g332 Prominent le/g332\nProminent right Prominent right Absent right Absent rightAbsent le/g332 Absent le/g332120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0PCS length (mm)\nControls No hallucina/g415ons  Hallucina/g415ons∗∗∗\n∗PCS PCS\nCS CS\nFigure  3.

      "text": "because  self-generated  events  have  attenuated  or  missing  records  of  the  cognitive  or  motor\noperations  that  produced  them  [56].\nDespite  the  interpretational  complexities  inherent  in  studying  a  heterogeneous  syndrome  such\nas  schizophrenia,  a  number  of  predictions  have  been  tested  that  arise  from  the  hypothesis\nlinking  disrupted  reality  monitoring  with  hallucinations,  and  the  assumption  that  some  common\nprocesses  are  involved  in  distinguishing  reality  from  imagination  both  retrospectively  and  in  real\ntime.  One  prediction  is  that  individuals  with  schizophrenia  should  be  impaired  on  seen  versus\nimagined  memory  tasks  that  have  been  shown  to  elicit  anterior  PFC  activity  in  healthy\nvolunteers.  Of  20  studies  of  reality  monitoring  in  schizophrenia  surveyed  for  this  article  (Table  1),\ninvolving  a  total  of  700  patients  and  505  controls,  19  studies  reported  impaired  reality\nmonitoring  in  the  patients,  including  four  studies  in  which  the  deﬁcit  was  found  to  be  speci ﬁc\nto  reality  monitoring,  with  item  recognition  memory  being  preserved  [57 –60].  A  second\nprediction,  if  hallucinations  result  from  misidentifying  imagined  stimuli  as  being  real,  is  that\nan  externalization  bias  should  be  observed  in  schizophrenia  during  reality  monitoring  perfor-\nmance,  with  more  errors  on  self-generated  than  externally  generated  trials,  and  that  this  bias\nshould  be  greater  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  who  experience  hallucinations  than  in  those\nwho  do  not.  Of  the  four  studies  reporting  a  speci ﬁc  reality  monitoring  impairment  in  schizo-\nphrenia,  three  noted  that  the  deﬁcit  only  (or  disproportionately)  involved  the  misidenti ﬁcation  of\ninternally  generated  stimuli  as  having  been  externally  generated  [58 –60].  Furthermore,  all  ﬁve\nstudies  that  compared  reality  monitoring  in  patients  with  and  without  hallucinations,  and\nmeasured  externalization  bias,  observed  a  greater  likelihood  of  misidentifying  internally  gener-\nated  stimuli  as  being  real  in  the  patients  who  experienced  hallucinations  ([57,61 –64],  see  also\n[65,66]  for  previous  reviews  highlighting  such  associations).\nA  third  prediction  is  that  the  anterior  PFC  region  activated  in  healthy  volunteers  during  reality\nmonitoring  performance  should  be  among  the  areas  that  are  dysfunctional  in  patients  with\nschizophrenia.  Consistent  with  this  prediction,  the  anterior  PFC  region  linked  to  reality  moni-\ntoring  in  healthy  volunteers  overlaps  closely  [30]  with  one  of  the  areas  that  consistently  exhibit\nreduced  activity  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  compared  with  controls  during  performance  of  a\nrange  of  cognitive  tasks  [67 –71].  Moreover,  lower  anterior  PFC  activity  in  healthy  individuals\nduring  reality  monitoring  correlates  with  proneness  to  psychosis  and  schizotypal  trait  expres-\nsion  [37],  an  effect  that  is  also  observed  in  adolescents  at  risk  of  developing  schizophrenia  [72],\nsuggesting  its  potential  as  a  possible  marker  in  young  people  of  those  with  heightened\nlikelihood  of  converting  from  prodromal  to  full  psychosis  [73].\nA  fourth  prediction  is  that  healthy  volunteers  who  exhibit  reduced  levels  of  activity  in  anterior\nPFC  should  make  more  of  the  externalization  misattribution  errors  often  observed  in  schizo-\nphrenia.  Accordingly,  analysis  of  activity  in  the  anterior  PFC  across  participants  during  reality\nmonitoring  performance  has  revealed  a  signi ﬁcant  negative  correlation  with  the  likelihood  of\nmistakenly  endorsing  imagined  items  as  having  been  seen  [30].  A  ﬁfth  prediction  is  that  patients\nwith  schizophrenia  should  exhibit  disproportionately  reduced  activity  in  anterior  PFC  during\nperformance  of  reality  monitoring  tasks,  an  effect  that  has  been  reported  in  three  studies  to  date\n[60,74,112] ,  and  which  may  be  partly  ameliorated  by  cognitive  training  interventions  [74]\n(although  this  latter  possibility  requires  replication  in  larger  samples).  A  sixth  prediction,  if\nhallucinations  in  schizophrenia  are  attributable  to  overstimulation  of  sensory  processing  areas\nand  reality  monitoring  dysfunction,  is  that  altered  functional  connectivity  should  be  observed\nbetween  posterior  sensory  cortices  and  anterior  PFC.  Accordingly,  several  studies  have\nreported  impaired  functional  integration  between  superior  temporal  cortex  and  medial  regions\nof  anterior  PFC  associated  with  misattribution  by  patients  with  schizophrenia  of  their  own\nspeech  as  that  of  somebody  else  [75,76] .  Finally,  based  on  the  speci ﬁc  structural  basis  for\nreality  monitoring  identi ﬁed  in  the  PCS  [41],  hallucinations  in  schizophrenia  should  be\nTrends  in  Cognitive  Sciences,  June  2017,  Vol.  21,  No.  6  467"

      "text": "Reality  Monitoring  and  Hallucinations\nThese  ﬁndings  provide  evidence  that  reality  monitoring  impairment  may  be  a  key  component  of\nthe  cognitive  basis  for  the  hallucinations  experienced  by  many  patients  with  schizophrenia.\nHowever,  it  is  not  only  people  with  a  mental  health  diagnosis  who  experience  hallucinations.\nApproximately  1%  of  the  general  population  report  hearing  voices  when  no  speaker  is  present,\nbut  do  not  seek  professional  help  or  receive  a  clinical  diagnosis  [79].  Phenomenally,  the  auditory\nhallucination  experience  tends  to  be  similar  in  clinical  and  non-clinical  voice-hearers  in  terms  of\nloudness,  involvement  of  others ’  voices,  number  of  voices,  and  so  forth,  but  can  differ  in\nfrequency,  duration,  and  content,  with  patients  typically  experiencing  negative  voices  whereas\nnon-clinical  individuals  are  sometimes  more  likely  to  report  neutral  or  pleasant  content  to  their\nhallucinations  [80 –82].  Recent  interest  has  focused  on  whether  there  might  be  a  common\nneurocognitive  basis  for  hallucinations  in  clinical  and  non-clinical  groups.  If  reduced  reality\nmonitoring  ability  is  part  of  the  explanation  for  the  hallucinations  observed  in  schizophrenia,  can\nit  also  account  for  the  symptoms  experienced  by  non-clinical  voice-hearers?\nEvidence  consistent  with  a  common  underlying  mechanism  comes  from  one  study  of  reality\nmonitoring  in  healthy  volunteers  which  found  that  participants  who  were  prone  to  experience\nhallucinations  were  more  likely  than  other  participants  to  misidentify  self-generated  words  as\nhaving  been  spoken  by  the  experimenter  [83].  However,  two  more  recent  studies  involving\nhealthy  individuals  with  a  proneness  to  hallucinations  found  no  evidence  of  an  impairment  in\nsource  or  reality  monitoring,  or  of  an  increased  externalization  bias,  in  such  non-clinical  voice-\nhearers  [84,85] .  Evidence  from  neuroimaging  suggests  common  hallucination-related  activity  in\nauditory  processing  areas  such  as  the  superior  temporal  gyrus  in  clinical  and  non-clinical\ngroups  [86],  and  a  correlation  between  the  auditory  hallucination  proneness  scores  of  non-\nclinical  participants  and  activity  in  superior  temporal  gyrus  when  imagining  voices  they  subse-\nquently  misidenti ﬁed  as  being  heard  [87].  Clinical  and  non-clinical  voice-hearers  also  have\nsimilar  aberrant  microstructure  of  the  arcuate  fasciculus  connection  between  frontal  and\ntemporal  cortices  [88,89] ,  but  there  is  so  far  no  evidence  as  to  whether  hallucinations  experi-\nenced  by  non-clinical  individuals  reﬂect  the  same  pattern  of  anterior  PFC  dysfunction  that  has\nbeen  observed  in  patients  with  schizophrenia.\nIt  may  well  be  that  there  is  more  than  one  route  by  which  hallucinations  might  occur  in  clinical\nand  non-clinical  groups.  Hallucinations  are  sometimes  experienced  spontaneously  in  healthy\nindividuals  during  periods  of  sensory  deprivation  [50],  auditory  hallucinations  can  follow  the\nonset  of  deafness  [90],  and  visual  hallucinations  can  occur  following  visual  cortex  injury  [91].\nThese  observations  ﬁt  with  the  proposal  that  hyperactivation  of  sensory  processing  cortices\nmight  provide  the  perceptual  content  for  hallucinatory  experiences  [92].  Consistent  with  this\nproposal  is  evidence  that,  in  healthy  individuals  during  periods  of  silence,  there  is  spontaneous\nrandom  activity  in  speech-sensitive  auditory  processing  areas  within  the  superior  temporal\ngyrus,  together  with  associated  activation  in  the  anterior  cingulate  region  of  the  medial  PFC\n[93].  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  hallucination  is  initiated  by  spontaneous  random  activity  in\nsensory  processing  areas,  such  as  the  superior  temporal  gyrus  in  the  case  of  auditory\nhallucinations,  reﬂecting  spontaneous  ‘inner  speech ’  and/or  remembered  speech,  which\nmay  occur  with  greater  intensity  or  frequency  during  periods  of  stress  or  heightened  emotion\n[81].  In  healthy  individuals  who  do  not  experience  hallucinations,  such  sensory  activity  may  be\ncorrectly  identi ﬁed  as  being  internally  generated  by  reality  monitoring  processes  supported  by\nanterior  medial  PFC,  and  experienced  as  an  imagined  voice.  In  patients  with  schizophrenia  who\nexperience  hallucinations,  spontaneous  sensory  hyperactivity  may  be  even  more  intense,\naccompanied  by  hypoactivation  of  medial  PFC  regions  (consistent  with  studies  of  connectivity\n[75,76] ),  resulting  in  a  reality  monitoring  impairment  that  leads  to  failure  to  recognize  the  activity\nas  self-generated  and  to  the  experience  of  a  hallucination.  In  non-clinical  voice-hearers,  the\nspontaneous  activity  in  sensory  processing  areas  may  either  be  of  such  intensity,  or  be\nTrends  in  Cognitive  Sciences,  June  2017,  Vol.  21,  No.  6  469"

      "text": "sufﬁciently  unusual  in  character  (perhaps  due  to  emotional  stress,  trauma,  or  tiredness  [81]),\nthat  an  otherwise  intact  reality  monitoring  system  fails  to  recognize  the  stimuli  as  generated\ninternally,  and  a  sporadic  hallucination  is  experienced.  A  multifactor  model  such  as  this  (see  also\n[92,94] )  can  also  explain  why  some  participant  groups,  such  as  older  adults  [95],  people  with\ndevelopmental  disorders  such  as  autism  [96],  and  healthy  volunteers  with  bilateral  PCS\nabsence  [41],  may  exhibit  reductions  in  performance  on  reality  monitoring  tasks  but  do  not\napparently  experience  hallucinations.  These  ﬁndings  may  be  less  compatible  with  single  factor\naccounts,  such  as  those  involving  prediction  error  (e.g.,  [97]).\nConcluding  Remarks\nThere  is  still  much  to  discover  about  the  brain  mechanisms  underlying  reality  monitoring,  and\nthe  ways  in  which  they  may  fail  in  health  and  disease,  impairing  the  accuracy  of  judgments\nabout  what  is  real  (see  Outstanding  Questions).  Reality  monitoring  processes  are  fundamental\nfor  maintaining  an  understanding  of  the  self  as  a  distinct,  conscious  agent  interacting  with  the\nworld,  perceiving  and  interpreting  external  information  relating  to  events  happening  around  us\nand  generating  our  own  thoughts  and  imaginations  and  responses.  Generally,  people  are  able\nto  keep  the  ‘internal ’  and  ‘external ’  worlds  distinguished  sufﬁciently  from  one  another  to\nfunction  under  everyday  circumstances  but,  occasionally,  anyone  may  confuse  real  experi-\nences  with  those  they  might  have  been  told  about  or  imagined  or  dreamt.  Some  individuals  face\na  greater  difﬁculty  in  reality  monitoring,  perhaps  reﬂecting  speci ﬁc  individual  differences  in  the\ngeneral  population  or,  in  more  severe  cases,  dysfunction  caused  by  neurological  or  psychiatric\ndisease.\nThe  evidence  from  cognitive  neuroscience  research  to  date  converges  to  suggest  that  the\nanterior  PFC  region  of  the  brain  is  central  to  reality  monitoring  ability  and  disability.  It  is  a  key\ncomponent  of  brain  networks  that  are  engaged  when  distinguishing  internally  and  externally\ngenerated  information,  and  its  disruption  is  associated  with  misattributions  of  reality,  confusing\ninternally  generated  information  with  events  taking  place  in  the  outside  world.  It  appears  to  play\nan  important,  and  previously  underappreciated,  role  in  the  psychotic  experiences  that  charac-\nterize  disorders  such  as  schizophrenia.  The  processes  underlying  reality  monitoring  are,\nsimilarly  to  many  higher  cognitive  functions,  complex  [9],  but  progress  has  been  made  by\nlaboratories  around  the  world  in  recent  years  leading  to  a  greater  understanding  of  the  brain\nregions,  especially  the  anterior  PFC,  that  subserve  reality  monitoring  mechanisms.  An  impor-\ntant  next  challenge  will  be  to  apply  this  knowledge  to  the  development  of  cognitive  training\ntechniques  and  other  rehabilitation  interventions  aimed  at  enhancing  the  ability  to  distinguish\nbetween  real  and  imagined  experiences  in  people  whose  sense  of  reality  may  be  disturbed.\nPreliminary  evidence  suggests  that  such  an  approach  might  have  potential  [74,98] ,  but\nresearchers  are  only  at  the  beginning  of  this  road  and  there  is  much  further  work  to  do  before\nit  can  be  determined  whether  the  potential  is  real.\nAcknowledgments\nPreparation  of  this  article  was  supported  by  a  James  S.
