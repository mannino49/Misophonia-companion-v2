These obser-\nvations lead us to propose that ASMR is a distinct phenomenon owing to its\nattention dispatch mechanism and its connection with emotion regulation.We suggest that increased activations in the insula, along with reduction\nin connectivity within the salience and default mode networks in ASMR\nresponders, may account for their experiences of relaxation and flow states.\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Sensing and feeling: an integrative\napproach to sensory processing and emotional experience ’.\n1. Introduction\nAutonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a nonclinical term to describe\na multidimensional phenomenon primarily triggered by auditory and audio-\nvisual stimuli [ 1,2]. Individuals who experience ASMR describe a tingling\nsensation, originating in the head and spreading down to the body, accompaniedby a feeling of relaxation and a mental state known as ‘flow ’[1,3]. In a flow state, a\nperson is fully engrossed in an activity, free from self-consciousness, deeply\nfocused and experiencing a distortion of time [ 4].\nThe estimated prevalence of ASMR ranges from 23.5 to 28% [ 5,6]. The\ncommon ASMR triggers include auditory and audio-visual stimuli made with\npersons whispering, eating, and using objects to make sounds [ 2]. Low-pitched\nsounds with dark timbre are effective in inducing ASMR [ 2,7].\nASMR can be regarded as an illusion or altered perception, transitioning from\naudio-visual information to tactile sensation. In this article, we compare ASMRwith related sensory phenomena, including sensory processing sensitivity\n(SPS), synaesthesia, Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) and misophonia.\nIndividuals with a SPS trait are easily overstimulated by external stimuli, andresearch has shown that their ASMR intensity is associated with SPS levels [ 8].\nSynaesthesia is a phenomenon where a stimulus in one sensory modality elicits\nsensations in that modality and other modalities, and a higher prevalence of\n© 2024 The Authors.

      "text": "synaesthesia has been found among ASMR responders [ 1,6,9]. AIWS is a neurological condition known for distorted perception of the\nbody and space, and it shares a distortion of time perception with ASMR. In addition, the prevalence of AIWS symptoms among\nASMR responders (46.6%) is higher than the prevalence of AIWS in the general population (approx. 9%) [ 10–12]. Individuals with\nmisophonia experience negative emotions and aversive responses elicited by specific auditory and visual stimuli. Given the overlapin triggers between ASMR and misophonia (e.g. eating sounds and repetitive tapping), ASMR and misophonia are suggested to share\nsame mechanisms [ 13]. Although ASMR is linked to positive emotions, and misophonia is associated with negative emotions, there is\na higher prevalence of misophonia among ASMR responders and vice versa [14–16].\nThis article reviews functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate the brain activations observed in\nthese phenomena or in individuals who experience these phenomena, with a focus on the following brain regions: the insula and\ncingulate cortex (CC) related to social cognition and emotion regulation, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the reward system, and thesensory-motor system, including the premotor area (PMA), supplementary motor area (SMA) and somatosensory cortex.\nThree large-scale brain networks in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), including the salience network (SN), default mode network\n(DMN) and central executive network (CEN) ( figure 1 ), are also compared between ASMR and its related phenomena. The SN is\ninvolved in detecting salient stimuli and switching between the DMN and the CEN [ 17]. The DMN is active when a person is at\nwakeful rest, such as during mind wandering and introspection. Meanwhile, the CEN is active when a person is engaged in\nspecific tasks [ 18–22]. Through these comparisons, we aim to elucidate the similarities and differences in the brain circuits in ASMR\nand related phenomena. In addition to the brain circuits, we explore triggers, physiological responses, comorbidities and genetic\npredisposition associated with these phenomena.\nTo investigate brain activations and networks in these phenomena, we conducted a search on PubMed using keywords specific\nto each phenomenon, along with ‘fMRI ’. In most cases, there are a handful of papers to review. Nevertheless, our search yielded\nnumerous papers on synaesthesia. As many of these papers provide evidence supporting the theory of increased co-activations or\nconnectivity across brain regions in synaesthetes, we only referred to some of the most cited papers that support and oppose thistheory. Additionally, we searched for related literature using ‘electroencephalography (EEG) ’and ‘magnetoencephalography\n(MEG) ’, but we found a very limited amount of literature using EEG and MEG to investigate these phenomena.\n(a) Autonomous sensory meridian response\nASMR elicits physiological responses in ASMR responders, including increased pupil diameters [ 23], enhanced skin conductance\nand reduced heart rate [ 24,25]. These observations suggest that ASMR induces arousal and relaxation among these individuals.\nThere are two types of fMRI studies in ASMR research: task-positive fMRI studies, which compare brain activations in ASMR\nresponders and non-responders while they watch ASMR videos and control videos; and task-negative rs-fMRI studies, whichcompare brain functional connectivity between ASMR responders and non-responders. In task-positive fMRI studies, brain acti-\nvations in the insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), NAc, secondary somatosensory cortex and SMA are more\npronounced for ASMR responders when they experience a tingling sensation during ASMR videos than watching a fixationcross (namely, the control condition) [ 26]. In another study, while both ASMR responders and non-responders watched ASMR\nand control videos, ASMR responders showed more activity in the dACC, PMA and SMA in the ASMR condition than in the con-\ntrol condition, but non-responders only showed increased activity in the cuneus [ 27]. Auditory-only ASMR stimuli have been\nshown to increase activations of the insula and NAc compared with the resting condition [ 28]. The involvement of the insula\nand ACC suggests the significance of social cognition, emotion regulation and the perception of social pain in ASMR experience\n[29,30]. The insula, ACC and NAc are also activated during music-induced chills [ 31–34].\nWhile the activations in the insula and dACC, the key hubs in the SN, increase in ASMR responders when they watch ASMR\nvideos, rs-fMRI studies showed less connectivity in the precuneus-centred DMN, SN and CEN (except in the left middle cingulate\ncortex) in ASMR responders than in non-responders [ 35,36].

The salience network consists of the\ninsula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC).

In addition to SN, DMN and CEN, other networks such as the sensorimotor and\nvisual networks have been compared between ASMR responders and non-responders. The results show reduced functional\nconnectivity in these two networks in ASMR responders [ 36].\nThe EEG studies exploring brain waves in different frequency ranges show increased alpha-wave activities when ASMR\nresponders experience ASMR responses (i.e. tingling sensation) to ASMR stimuli [ 38,39]. Interestingly, footstep sounds, a less\ncommon ASMR trigger, were also observed to increased alpha-wave activities, especially among those who were less sensitiveto these sounds and have a positive attitude toward them [ 40]. These findings indicate facilitation of attention-directed information\nand inhibition of irrelevant information [ 41]. This implication is consistent with the fMRI finding of insula activation in ASMR\nexperiences, as the insula plays an important role in salience detection [ 17,42–44].\nAlthough ASMR and autism share auditory sensitivity, there is no evidence supporting the association between ASMR and\nautism [ 45]. ASMR videos have been reported to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety [ 1,46].\n(b) Sensory processing sensitivity\nSPS is defined as a personality trait characterized by being overstimulated by external stimuli, especially the positive ones, with heigh-\ntened emotional responses [ 47,48]. SPS exhibits a prevalence ranging from 15 to 31% [ 48,49]. The Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) scale\n[49] has been used to measure the level of SPS, in addition to the Orienting Sensitivity subscale of the Adult Temperament Question-\nnaire [ 50]. The HSP scale comprises three subscales: low sensory threshold (LST), ease of excitation (EOE) and aesthetic sensitivity\n(AES) [ 51]. Genetic and twin studies suggest that SPS is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, with the AES subscale dif-\nferentiating from the LST and EOE subscales [ 52,53]. The intensity of ASMR is associated with the AES subscale [ 8], while autism\nsymptoms, alexithymia, anxiety and depression are linked to the EOE and LST subscales [ 54,55].\nThere are various triggers for individuals with SPS. In a study subjecting a group of adolescents to a stress test, their changes in\nheart rate, heart rate variability and skin conductance were not correlated with SPS, but their perceived stress was associated withSPS [ 56]. The relationship between SPS and subjective perception of stress indicates that the insula, especially the anterior insula,\nmay play an important role in SPS. The anterior insula has been argued to integrate information from the internal and external\nstimuli, and its activity is associated with subjective feeling [ 42].\nSeveral fMRI studies have explored the relationship between SPS levels and brain activations by using various stimuli. The SPS\nlevels were positively correlated with reaction times to detect major and minor changes in visual stimuli and activations in the\nright claustrum, bilateral temporal cortex, bilateral precuneus and right inferior parietal cortex [ 57]. Another study observed\nthe association between SPS levels and activations in the CC and PMA by using partner ’s and strangers ’faces with different\nemotions [ 58]. In addition, the primary somatosensory cortex and ventral tagmental area (VTA) were specifically activated by com-\nparing the brain activations for partner ’s and strangers ’happy face. In another study, wherein the participants were touched by an\nexperimenter, SPS levels were linked to brain activations in the insula [ 59]. Collectively, these findings in fMRI studies highlight the\nbrain regions related to social cognition and empathy for social stimuli, such as the insula and CC, and those related to the reward\npathway for positive stimuli, such as the VTA.\nAn rs-fMRI study has shown that the SPS levels were associated with e nhanced brain connectivity within the SN and the dorsal atten-\ntion network, as well as the limbic network [ 60]. These findings suggest an important role of attention and emotion regulation in SPS.\n2. Synaesthesia\nSynaesthesia is a phenomenon wherein a stimulus for a sensory modality elicits sensations in that modality and other modalities.\nThe prevalence of various forms of synaesthesia is 4.4%, and the estimated prevalence of grapheme –colour synaesthesia, in which\nletters and numbers elicit colour perception, is 1.1% [ 61]. Although the presence of synaesthesia in family members suggests a\nhereditary connection [ 62,63], a twin study demonstrates that synaesthesia is a heritable condition that is influenced by epigenetic\nand environmental factors [ 64]. Previous studies have reported a higher prevalence of synaesthesia in the autism population com-\npared with the neurotypical population. This association between autism and synaesthesia is believed to be mediated by attention\nto details and abnormal sensory processing [ 65–69].\nNumerous studies have explored the neural basis of synaesthesia and identified activation in the sensory cortices beyond the\nstimulated modality and increased connectivity in sensory networks [ 70–73]. An rs-fMRI study revealed increased intranetwork\nconnectivity from the medial and the lateral visual networks to the right frontoparietal network in grapheme –colour synaesthetes\n[74]. Nevertheless, ongoing debate persists about these findings and whether we should consider alternative neural models [ 75].\nFor example, the report of activation in the insula and CC in synaesthesia should be noted [ 76].\nMirror-touch synaesthesia, which involves experiencing tactile sensations on their own bodies upon seeing someone else\ntouched [ 77], has been reported in approximately 1.6% of the population [ 78]. Some researchers debate about whether this\nphenomenon is a synaesthesia or vicarious experience, an empathetic state induced by seeing someone ’s sensations, emotions\nand actions [ 79]. Activations in the somatosensory cortex in mirror-touch synaesthetes may be related to empathy [ 80–83].\nAdditionally, mirror-touch synaesthetes exhibit higher autistic trait scores compared with the control group [ 84].\n(a) Alice in Wonderland syndrome\nAIWS is a neurological condition characterized by distorted perception of the body, objects, space and time [ 10,85–87]. These percep-\ntual distortions can manifest across the visual (e.g. dysmorphopsia, macropsia, micropsia and teleopsia), auditory and somaestheticroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans.

AIWS has also been found among people who use certain medication, such as 5-HT2 antagonist,\nand during intoxication with some substances, such as cannabis [ 10].\nA lesion-mapping study identified local maxima across the lesions in the right occipital lobe, primarily driven by those with\nAIWS symptoms in the visual domain [ 102]. Those patients who had AIWS symptoms only in the somaesthetic domain exhibited\nlesions in the limbic system, including the insula, thalamus, CC, hippocampus and parahippocampus. This lesion study did notinclude participants perceiving time distortion, but the insula has been argued to be involved in time perception [ 103].\nAn imaging study that compared migraine patients with AIWS, migraine patients with typical aura, and healthy individuals\nshowed that all migraine patients (with and without AIWS) had a lower functional connectivity in the lateral and the medial visualnetworks and higher functional connectivity in the SN and DMN compared with the healthy individuals [ 104].\n3. Misophonia\nMisophonia describes the phenomenon of experiencing negative emotions and aversive responses triggered by specific auditory and\nvisual stimuli. Given the lack of well defined criteria for misophonia, estimates of its prevalence vary widely, ranging from 5.9 to 49.1%\n[16,105–109]. Although misophonia is not included in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), researchers have\nproposed diagnostic criteria of misophonia to address this issue [ 110–112]. Misophonia typically involves excessive and dispropor-\ntional negative emotions, often leading affected individuals to avoid the triggering stimuli. Furthermore, individuals with\nmisophonia exhibit physiological responses when exposed to such triggers, including increased skin conductance, elevated heartrate and an increased low-frequency component of heart rate variability [ 113–117]. These physiological responses indicate heightened\nsympathetic tones.\nfMRI studies have established a connection between misophonia and increased brain activation in the insula, auditory cortex,\ntemporal cortex, CC, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and PMA. Furthermore, misophonia is linked to increased functional con-\nnectivity between the insula and the mPFC, the key hubs in the SN and the DMN [ 114,115,117], indicating the link between the SN\nand the DMN. On the other hand, the association between misophonia and increased brain activations in the orofacial motor arearemains debated [ 118,119].\nMisophonia has been found to be comorbid with various psychiatric conditions, including obsessive –compulsive personality\ndisorder, mood disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, tinnitus, hyperacusis, post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), eating disorders, migraine with visual aura, anxiety sensitivity, and hypersensitivity [ 15,109,120–123].\n4. Discussion\nThis review encompasses the identification of the common and distinctive neural circuits associated with ASMR and related sen-\nsory phenomena, including SPS, synaesthesia, AIWS and misophonia, to shed light on their underlying neural mechanisms.Among these phenomena, ASMR and SPS share activation in the reward pathway. Activation in the NAc are observed in\nASMR, while activations in the VTA are observed in SPS. The involvement of these reward-related regions in ASMR is consistent\nwith experiences of music-induced pleasure and frisson, characterized by the sensation of goose-bumps or shivers down the spine[33,34]. ASMR and mirror-touch synaesthesia share activation in the somatosensory cortex. While the role of the somatosensory\ncortex in mirror-touch synaesthesia is suggested to be linked to empathy, the role of the somatosensory cortex in ASMR may be\nlinked to sound localization and head orientation [ 124,125].\nThe insula, a pivotal brain region, emerges as a shared activation site in ASMR, SPS, AIWS (in the somaesthetic domain) and\nmisophonia. The insula has connections with the cingulate, frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices and subcortical struc-\ntures, such as the amygdala and NAc [ 126–129]. The insula plays an important role in novel stimuli detection and is part of the SN,\nalongside the dACC and amygdala. In addition to salience detection, the insula is involved in visceral sensations, autonomic\ncontrol, affective processes, sensorimotor processes, auditory processing, taste, olfaction and pain. The insula is proposed to be\nthe centre of awareness and the interoceptive template for a ‘feeling ’[42–44]. The insula and ACC are closely connected and\nusually activate together, and they play an important role in social pain and empathy [ 130,131]. In summary, activation in the\ninsula observed in ASMR, SPS, AIWS and misophonia is associated with peculiar perception and emotional responses observed\nin these phenomena.\nDiverging from the previously mentioned shared brain activations, rs-fMRI studies uncover unique facets of these phenomena.\nASMR responders exhibit weaker connectivity in the SN despite strong activations in the key hubs of the SN, the insula and\nthe dACC. This finding suggests a diminished capacity for attention switch between internal and external stimuli. Furthermore,non-synchronization of the SN with strongly activated insula and dACC may result in altered perception. By contrast, increased\nconnectivity in the SN is observed in SPS and AIWS, potentially linked to their sensory sensitivity or distortion.\nThis review also explores the comorbidities associated with these phenomena. ASMR exhibits links to temporary reduction of\nanxiety and depression symptoms but not to autism. Meanwhile, SPS is associated with autism, anxiety and depression;\nsynaesthesia with autism; AIWS with migraine; and misophonia with autism, anxiety, depression and migraine. In other\nwords, ASMR is on the opposite of the phenomena SPS, synaesthesia and misophonia.\nThis review acknowledges certain limitations. Heterogeneity amongst the participants in ASMR, SPS, synaesthesia, AIWS\nand misophonia studies, stemming from symptom-based definitions and questionnaire assessments poses a significant\nlimitation. The modest amount of literature on these phenomena (except synaesthesia) also exacerbates this limitation.royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

      "text": "Furthermore, the diversity of the stimuli employed in physiological and imaging studies, the relatively small sample sizes and\nvariations in experimental paradigms contribute to the need for caution in drawing definitive conclusions. Accordingly, this article\nserves as a basis for further investigations aimed at unravelling the intricate correlations between ASMR-induced sensations and\nneural networks. Future studies should address standardized stimuli and psychophysical approaches to objectively identify thetarget group.\n5. Conclusion\nThe culmination of previous studies demonstrates that ASMR is distinct from related phenomena with altered sensory processing,including SPS, synaesthesia, AIWS and misophonia. Nonetheless, ASMR, SPS and misophonia all involve activation of the insulaand CC related to social cognition and emotion regulation. ASMR differentiates itself from SPS through its reduced connectivity\nwithin the SN. Reduced connectivity in the SN during ASMR experiences indicates a particular way to direct attention that links to\nthe feeling of relaxation and the flow state.\nData accessibility.\nAll data gathered for this review may be available upon request to the corresponding author.\nDeclaration of AI use.
