Evidence suggests that misophonia develops in adolescence and \nthe emotions and behaviors are a conditioned response to distress, resulting in social avoidance, stress, and \nfamily conflict. In addition, co-occurrence with other psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety, OCD, and Tourette \nsyndrome is common. A transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapeutic (CBT) approach appears appropriate. \nThere are currently no controlled studies of youth with misophonia. The current paper describes the approach to \na pilot randomized, blinded family-based treatment study for youth ages 8-16 years. Preliminary results from a \npilot open trial also are described. \nMethods: A 2-phase dual site telehealth treatment study using a transdiagnostic CBT approach, the Unified \nProtocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A; \nEhrenreich-May et al., 2018), is proposed. Phase 1 consisted of a 4-case pilot of UP-C/A. Phase 2 includes a \nrandomized trial comparing the UP-C/A to a standard relaxation and education protocol. \nResults: Preliminary results from the pilot show modest improvements in evaluator-rated misophonia symptoms \non the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement scales . \nLimitations: There is little research to inform evidence-based practice for youth with misophonia. Study limita -\ntions include lack of standardized misophonia assessment instruments and an absence of formal diagnostic \ncriteria. \nConclusions: The current paper describes proposed methods for the first randomized controlled trial for youth \nwith misophonia and their families along with results from a 4-case pilot.   \n1.Introduction \nMisophonia, from the Latin miso ‘hatred ’ and phonia ‘sound, ’ was \nfirst described by audiologists, Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2001) , to be a \ncondition marked by a strong aversion to specific sounds and noises. \nOver the past decade, there have been increasing clinical reports and \nstudy of misophonia, but notably, there has been a lack of diagnostic \nclassification in either DSM-5 or ICD-10. Merriam-Webster (n.d.) defines \nmisophonia as: \nA condition in which one or more common sounds (such as the ticking of a clock, the hum of a fluorescent light, or the chewing or \nbreathing of another person) cause an atypical emotional response (such \nas disgust, distress, panic, or anger) in the affected person hearing the \nsound. \nThe scientific and clinical communities ’ descriptions of misophonia \ngenerally converge, characterizing the central nature of misophonia to \nbe an emotional experience to sound triggers as opposed to abnormal \nsensory perception/pain. Abnormal hearing thresholds have not been \nreported in misophonia (Schroder et al., 2013 ). The sound ’s source is \noften highly specific and/or context dependent. For example, the \n*Corresponding author at: ABPP Department of Pediatrics, University of South Florida Rothman Center for Neuropsychiatry, 601 7th St. South, Suite 425, St. \nPetersburg, FL 33701, United States. \nE-mail address: alewin@usf.edu (A.B.

      "text": "Journal of Affective Disorders 291 (2021) 400–408\n401expectation of a sound and/or observation of someone chewing through \na sound-proof window can elicit similar levels of emotional reaction. \nMisophonia likely has less to do with the physical properties of partic -\nular trigger sounds (e.g., frequency, intensity) than with the context and \nhistorical emotional experiences associated with the sound (Jastreboff \nand Jastreboff, 2001 ). Therefore, misophonia is best defined as selective \nsensitivity to sound triggers accompanied by emotional distress, physi -\nological arousal, and possibly behavioral reactions (e.g., avoidance). \n1.1. Phenomenology \nUnfortunately, the literature lacks comprehensive characterizations \nof misophonia, and there is very little replication from the case studies \nand convenience samples that provide most of the extant descriptions, \nespecially with regard to pediatric populations (Johnson et al., 2013 ). \nThere are no validated biological models, and the etiology of misopho -\nnia is unknown. From the first known clinical description, misophonia \nhas been described as emotional reactivity and autonomic arousal in the \ncontext of trigger sounds (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001 ). Anger, irri-\ntation, distress or disgust, and intense behavioral reactions (e.g., \navoidance, tantrums, aggression), which are markedly disproportional \nto the intensity or duration of the stimuli, are commonly reported. \nAnxiety, stress, and panic also are not uncommon, but people typically \ndo not report being fearful of the sound (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Physi -\nological hyperarousal is also common (Schwartz et al., 2011 ). It is \nposited that misophonia develops via conditioning: sounds become \nassociated with aversive emotions and physiological discomfort \n(Dozier, 2015 ; Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014 ; Lewin et al., 2015 ). The \nsocial context, attribution, or interpretation (e.g., presumed intent) \nappear to influence the subjective response to the sensory trigger \n(Bruxner, 2016 ; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). For \nexample, individuals with misophonia may be able to replicate a sound \n(e.g., chewing) without experiencing the arousal or discomfort that \noccurs when hearing a sibling chew. While classical conditioning may \nexplain development, operant learning mechanisms may serve to \nmaintain misophonia-related distress and impairment. As individuals \navoid contact with trigger sounds and experience immediate relief, they \nfail to learn to regulate negative emotions and come to rely upon escape \nor avoidance to manage distress (Hall et al., 2016 ; Jastreboff and Jas-\ntreboff, 2014 ). \nNotably, studies suggest hearing (sensitivity) threshold for in-\ndividuals with misophonia is within normal limits, possibly indicating \nthat the condition is not simply a result of a heightened acuity to sound. \nImpairment is commonly reported in misophonia, with symptoms \naffecting functioning in work, school, and family/social relationships. \nInitial studies suggest onset of symptoms in childhood to early teenage \nyears (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2017 ), although more \nsystematic study is needed to characterize onset and course. Similarly, \nthere are few data regarding the incidence of misophonia. Assessing \nincidence is further complicated by lack of formal ICD/DSM-5 diag-\nnostic criteria. It is generally agreed that the condition is not uncommon \nbut underreported and often not assessed, even in the context of psy-\nchiatric evaluation. A self-report survey of college students showed that \n20% of the sample indicated abnormal sensitivity to sound (Wu et al., \n2014 ). Notably, most of the sample identified symptom onset prior to \nadolescence (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). Findings vary \nwith regard to the presence of psychopathology in conjunction with \nmisophonia. Approximately 50% of an internet sample of adults with \nmisophonia reported at least one psychiatric disorder (N 301; Rouw \nand Erfanian, 2018 ). In the largest clinical sample to date, Jager et al. \n(2020) found that 22% of the sample met criteria for at least one psy-\nchiatric disorder (major depression 6.8%; obsessive-compulsive disorder \n[OCD] 2.8%). Erfanian et al. (2019) found that posttraumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD; 15.4%), OCD (11.5%), major depression (9.6%) and \nanorexia nervosa (9.6%) were the most common co-occurring condi -\ntions. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that this relationship may be bi-directional, especially in children and adolescents with OCD \nand tic spectrum disorders (Hazen et al., 2008 ; Lewin et al., 2015 ). \nUnfortunately, most phenomenological data on misophonia have been \ncollected from adults in convenience samples. The paucity of studies \ninvestigating misophonia among children and adolescents limits our \nunderstanding of its prevalence and course. \n1.2. Treatment research \nNot surprisingly, there are no formal practice parameters for the \ntreatment of misophonia. In fact, the misophonia treatment literature is \ndevoid of clinical trials or any controlled studies. Thus, there is no \nformative guidance for treating individuals with misophonia aside from \ncase studies and an open trial. Given the central nature of distress and \nemotional arousal combined with high associations with anxiety and \ndepressive disorders, investigating psychological treatment options ap-\npears warranted. Notably, Spankovich and Hall (2014) discussed six \npotential directions for misophonia treatment. Two approaches were \npsychological (counseling and psychological/psychiatric therapy). Two \nother options for intervention (“misophonia retraining therapy ” and \n“positive association and desensitization ”) also fall within the scope of \nbehavioral health and are centered around principles of operant and \nclassical conditioning as well as selective attention and accept -\nance/mindfulness (e.g., pairing pleasant stimuli with unpleasant, \nselectively focusing attention on other stimuli). The fifth approach to \ntreatment was a combination of autonomic calming tools such as \nrelaxation and meditation in addition to healthy diet and exercise. \nFinally, the authors discussed the use of hearing protective devices (e.g., \nearmuffs, noise cancelling devices) to attenuate sounds. The use of \nhearing protective devices is not recommended because individuals with \nmisophonia do not experience pain, but rather a strong emotional \nresponse to trigger sounds. Therefore, protective devices limit tolerance \nand emotional adjustment to the distress by reinforcing the belief that \nthe sounds must be avoided. In sum, despite initial description in \naudiology circles, misophonia has many characteristics of a psychiatric \ndisorder (Lewin et al., 2015 ; Lewin et al., 2015 ; Taylor, 2017 ) with key \nbehavioral and emotional treatment targets. Intense negative affect in \nthe context of sensory triggers, marked avoidance, deficit emotional \nregulation, poor flexibility, and potential cognitive processing biases are \npossible targets for intervention. \nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appears to be the appropriate \nstarting approach for developing and testing a psychotherapeutic \nintervention for misophonia. To date, the only relatively large trial (N \n90) found that 48% of adult subjects showed a significant reduction in \nmisophonia across two measures (Much or Very Much Improved on the \nCGI-I and a 30% reduction in symptoms on the AMISO-S; Schroder et al., \n2017 ). Nine percent reached symptom remission and 58% showed \nimprovement on the CGI-I only (Much or Very Much Improved on the \nCGI-I). The treatment focused on four domains: (1) attentional shifting \naway from certain stimuli (e.g., redirect focus of attention from a trigger \nsound); (2) counterconditioning to disrupt classically conditioned as-\nsociations between neutral/positive stimuli that have become paired \nwith negative emotional experiences; (3) stimulus manipulation exer-\ncises (allowing the participant to manipulate the sounds to engender a \nsense of control); and (4) relaxation exercises to improve emotional \ncontrol. The intervention was administered in groups for 7-8 sessions. \nUnfortunately, there is little information about the treatment of \nchildren and adolescents with misophonia despite the likely onset dur-\ning childhood (Mean age of misophonia onset 12.5 years; Schroder \net al., 2017 ). Similarly, in a large online sample of 301 adults with \nmisophonia (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ), 45% reported onset in child -\nhood, 30% during adolescence, and 15% “as long as I can remember. ” \nOnly 9% of those sampled reported that their symptoms began during \nadulthood. The overwhelming majority reported that their symptoms \nprogressively worsened with age. Given (1) the majority of misophonia \ncases are reported to begin in childhood, (2) there is some evidence for A.B. Lewin et al."

      "text": "Journal of Affective Disorders 291 (2021) 400–408\n402worsening /continuation of symptoms if untreated, (3) the limited \ntreatment research in children and adolescents with misophonia, and (4) \na better probability of remission in younger patients (Ginsburg et al., \n2011 ), empirical examination of a CBT approach for misophonia in \nchildren and adolescents appears indicated. \n1.3. Current treatment approach \nFor children and adolescents with misophonia, their emotional \nresponse to trigger sounds, and resulting behavioral problems and \nfunctional impairment, appear to be the primary targets for psychosocial \nintervention. Notably, many childhood cases occur in the context of \nother psychiatric disorders including OCD, Tourette, anxiety, mood, \nexternalizing, and eating disorders. Accordingly, we needed to select a \npsychotherapeutic approach to be specific enough to target misophonia \n(distress, avoidance, tolerance, externalizing responses, etc.) but broad \nenough to address co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symp -\ntoms and related functional impairment. Rather than developing a “CBT \nfor misophonia, ” which may have a complex and heterogeneous pre-\nsentation, established transdiagnostic approaches targeting mechanisms \nassociated with putative processes of misophonia and associated con-\nditions may provide a feasible solution. Transdiagnostic approaches are \nbased on the assumption that emotional dysfunction is shaped by \noverlapping emotional and behavioral processes and shared risk factors. \nThese transdiagnostic factors include poor emotional regulation ability \nand decreased ability to tolerate emotional (or physical) discomfort, \noften in the context of negative affective states. As a result of this poor \ntolerance of negative affective states, individuals engage in behaviors to \nsuppress, escape, or avoid the situations eliciting such distress (e.g., \navoidance, aggression, blame), which are negatively reinforced over \ntime (Barlow et al., 2014 ). A number of transdiagnostic factors appear \nconsistent with the emergence and maintenance of misophonia, \nincluding information processing biases (e.g., selective attention), \nincreased negative arousal, poor emotional control, low tolerance of \ndistress, heightened anxiety sensitivity, behavioral avoidance, and \nparenting behaviors that maintain maladaptive emotion regulation in \nchildren. The transdiagnostic targeting of distress intolerance, anxiety \nsensitivity, poor emotional regulation, and other factors may disrupt the \nmaintenance of misophonia. \nPilot CBT studies have investigated some of these transdiagnostic \nfactors in adults. Schroder and colleagues (2017) used a CBT approach, \nwhich included elements of conditioning and extinction, relaxation, \nattentional control, and procedures to increase one’s locus of control \nover emotions/sensations. In a similar approach, Frank and McKay \n(2019) suggested that inhibitory learning within the context of exposure \ntherapy might improve perceived control over emotional reactions, even \nin the absence of habituation to certain sounds. Mindfulness and \nacceptance-based strategies also have been suggested for inclusion in the \ntreatment of misophonia (Schneider and Arch, 2017 ). Unlike models of \nexposure therapy with response prevention to fears/anxiety, it is not \nexpected that individuals with misophonia would habituate to sounds. \nRather, the target for therapy can better be conceptualized as the \ntolerance of distress in the context of sound triggers; exposure therapy \nmay be useful for facilitating use of mindfulness, inhibitory learning, \nand similar approaches for emotional regulation. \n1.4. Unified protocol \nThe Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional \nDisorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A) are manualized treat-\nments for emotional disorders among youth (Ehrenreich-May et al., \n2018). The UP-C/A utilize a transdiagnostic family-based approach to \naddress underlying mechanisms implicated in the development and \nmaintenance of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and ado-\nlescents via evidence-based cognitive-behavioral and “third wave ” \nbehavioral treatment techniques, such as cognitive reappraisal, problem-solving, mindfulness, and opposite action strategies. The hy-\npothesized mechanisms of change in the UP-C/A are increased tolerance \nof distress when experiencing strong or intense emotional states. A \nsecondary target is the reduction of (1) frequent negative affect re-\nsponses to inert triggers, and (2) excessive avoidance behavior. The UP- \nC/A have been shown to help adolescents and children with emotional \ndisorders (e.g., anxiety, depression) in multiple baseline, open trial, and \nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) across intervention and prevention \ncontexts (Ehrenreich et al., 2009 ; Ehrenreich-May et al., 2017 ; Kennedy \net al., 2019 ; Kennedy et al., 2018 , Hawks et al., 2020 ). The UP-C/A \nappear ideally suited for patients with misophonia because of the \nstrong evidence suggesting the protocols can improve the characterized \nemotional and autonomic arousal targets (Sherman and Ehrenreich- -\nMay, 2020 ). The UP-C/A were developed to address core dysfunctions \n(e.g., heightened negative affect, poor tolerance of emotions, and \nexperiential avoidance) associated with a range of emotional or inter-\nnalizing disorders, including anxiety, depression, and related condi -\ntions. The UP-C/A include modules on motivation, mindful awareness, \nflexible thinking, problem-solving, and opposite actions, including a \nrange of exposure and activation techniques. The protocols have a \ncompanion caregiver-focused component to enhance adaptive parenting \nbehaviors that may be engaged when a caregiver encounters child \ndistress. The UP-C/A do not impose a rigid course of treatment, but \nrather, allow the clinician to personalize treatment components to the \nhighest priority challenges using a core set of evidence-based strategies \nand assessment tools (e.g., Top Problems; Weisz et al., 2011 ). In \nparticular, tools to improve emotional awareness, increase flexibility of \ncognitive appraisals, improve tolerance of physical/sensory sensations, \nand decrease emotional and situational avoidance are strongly consis -\ntent with models for treating misophonia-related distress and impair -\nment (Frank and McKay, 2019 ; Hall et al., 2016 ). \n1.5. Aims and hypotheses \nIn order to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a \ntransdiagnostic approach to the behavioral treatment of misophonia \namong children and adolescents, a 2-phase study was designed using the \nUP-C/A. In Phase 1 (completed), our aim was to conduct a pilot open \ntrial (N 4) for procedural refinement followed by a small-scale ran-\ndomized controlled trial (RCT; N 44) in Phase 2 (ongoing). The RCT \nwill compare the transdiagnostic approach using the UP-C/A to psy-\nchotherapy focused on misophonia education and emotional/physio -\nlogical relaxation (RE). We hypothesize that, relative to the relaxation- \nfocused approach, reduction in misophonia and overall psychiatric \nseverity (at post-treatment) will be greater for children and adolescents \nreceiving the UP-C/A. We also expect higher rates of treatment re-\nsponders in the UP-C/A condition. The current paper outlines proced -\nures for the RCT (Phase 2) and preliminary results from the pilot (Phase \n1). \n2.Methods \n2.1. Procedures \nAll study participants will receive 10 treatment sessions and partic -\nipate in 3 assessments. The assessments will occur at baseline (prior to \nsession 1), mid-treatment (after session 5), and post-treatment (after \nsession 10). Assessments will be conducted by independent evaluators \n(IE) who will be blinded to treatment condition (see Fig. 1 for a list of \nassessments). Participants who meet initial phone screen requirements \nwill attend a screening visit that includes informed parent consent, child \nassent, and a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of inclusion/exclu -\nsion criteria.

Children and adolescents with comorbidities will be \nincluded, but misophonia must be identified as one of the primary \nproblems. Inclusion is purposefully broad given (1) this is among the \nfirst controlled studies of misophonia among children and adolescents, \n(2) we expect diagnostic heterogeneity, and (3) the UP-C/A are trans -\ndiagnostic and equipped to treat broadly presenting symptoms. Family \nparticipation is required. \n3.Assessment \n3.1. Assessment of misophonia and other disorders \nThe Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5: Parent and \nChild Versions (ADIS-5-C/P) is a semi-structured interview that will be \nused to assess for various disorders in children and adolescents (Silver -\nman & Albano, in preparation). IEs will assign a clinician severity rating \n(CSR) on a scale from 0 (absent) to 8 (very severe) for each disorder. By \nconvention, a CSR ≽4 is considered to represent diagnostic threshold. \nSince the ADIS-5 does not include a misophonia module, the Misophonia \nAssessment Interview (MAI) was developed by the principal investigator \nfor this study and was designed to emulate an ADIS-5 module. Infor-\nmation about specific misophonia triggers, emotional responses to \nsound, behavioral responses, avoidance, insight/awareness, functional \nimpairment domains, and timeframe will be collected using the inter-\nview. The IE will assign a CSR rating for misophonia, which is consistent \nwith ADIS-5 procedures. \nPrimary Outcome Measures. The Clinical Global Impression \nSeverity and Improvement Scales (CGI-S/I; Guy, 1976 ) and the Child ’s \nGlobal Assessment Scale (CGAS; (Shaffer, 1983 ) will be the primary \noutcome measures. The CGI-I is a 7-point rating that establishes treat-\nment response from “very much improved ” to “very much worse. ” \nResponder status will be defined as a CGI-I rating of “much improved ” or \n“very much improved. ” The CGI-S is a 7-point rating that establishes \nseverity of illness from “not at all ill” to “extremely ill.” Misophonia \nremission status will be provisionally defined as (1) “borderline ” or “no \nillness ” on the CGI-I and (2) sub-diagnostic threshold on the CSR at \npost-treatment (Kelly and Mezuk, 2017). The CGI-S/I will be collected \nfor both misophonia and overall presentation. The CGAS will be used to \nrate general functioning and impairment independent of diagnoses. \nSecondary Outcome Measures. See Fig. 1 and Table 1 for all \nmeasure descriptions and assessment timeline. Therapists in both con-\nditions will establish top problems during the first session and obtain \nratings with parent and child at each session thereafter. Top problems \nwill be rated subjectively on a scale from 0 (not at all a problem) to 8 \n(very much a problem). Therapists will monitor participants ’ response \nto treatment using the top problem ratings according to the procedures \noutlined by Weisz et al., (2011) . Notably, assessment of misophonia is \nnot well-established. As such, many of the proposed outcome measures \nhave significant psychometric limitations. Therefore, secondary \noutcome measures will include broadband and narrowband scales \ncompleted by the parent and youth. Ratings of misophonia are supple -\nmented by well-established measures of comorbid conditions and \nbroad-based assessments. Given both the transdiagnostic nature of the \nUP-C/A and the typically heterogenous clinical presentation of miso-\nphonia, we decided to examine outcomes in multiple ways. We will \ndetermine the clinical severity and improvement using the CGI-S/I. We \nwill use the ADIS-5/MAI to examine diagnostic improvements. Broad \nand narrow symptom measures (e.g., BASC-3, RCADS, MAQ, AMISO-S) \nand measures of putative transdiagnostic processes (e.g., distress toler-\nance) will be used to determine global improvements in emotion regu-\nlation. Finally, parent and child top problems will be collected weekly to \nexamine functional changes. This comprehensive approach is aimed at \n(1) examining group differences in misophonia treatment and (2) better \nunderstanding characterization of symptom and functional changes in \nyouth with a complex, under-researched condition.

Specific measures of \ninterest in Phase 1 reported here included CGI-S/I Overall and Miso-\nphonia (primary outcome measure), CSR Misophonia, Misophonia \nAssessment Questionnaire (MAQ; Johnson, 2013 ), Amsterdam Miso-\nphonia Scale (AMISO-S; Schroder et. al, 2013 ), Revised Children ’s \nAnxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; Chorpita et al., 2000 ), Distress \nTolerance Questionnaire (DTS; Simons and Gaher, 2005), and a \nsemi-structured feasibility and acceptability exit interview. MAQ scores \nwere interpreted as raw scores and were categorized as subclinical \n(0-11), mild (12-24), moderate (25-37), severe (38-50), and extreme \n(51-63). AMISO-S scores were interpreted as raw scores and were \ncategorized as subclinical (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), severe \n(15-19), and extreme (20-24). The RCADS was interpreted using \nT-scores with a clinical cutoff of 65 or greater. Finally, DTS was inter-\npreted using the total raw score where higher scores indicated greater \ntolerance to distress. \n3.2. Planned analysis \nPhase 1 analyses included descriptive statistics focused primarily on \nthe feasibility and acceptability of the treatment approach (see below for \nresults and discussion). In Phase 2, comparisons between groups in terms of primary and \nsecondary outcomes (see Table 1) will be evaluated with mixed-effects \nrepeated measures models. Models will include a random intercept \nand slope, and fixed effects for site (if significant), treatment group, visit, \nand treatment group-by-visit interaction. Effect sizes estimates (i.e., \nCohen ’s d) will be derived from covariate-adjusted estimated marginal \nmeans and standard errors. The proposed sample size of provides \nadequate power to detect an effect size of f .20 for the interaction \nbetween group and time, which Cohen (1988) characterizes as a small to \nmedium effect. \n3.3. Rater and therapist training and supervision \nStudy therapists will be supervised postdoctoral fellows or advanced \ndoctoral students with significant experience in misophonia and/or the \ncare of children/adolescents with emotional disorders. Therapists for \nthe UP-C/A will complete a 2-day training with the last author; a parallel \ntraining will be conducted with RE therapists. Both conditions will have \nweekly calls for supervision (by separate supervisors) and treatment \nfidelity following treatment initiation. Sessions will be recorded in Phase \n2, and 10% of recordings will be reviewed for fidelity to the intervention \nusing adapted versions of established UP-C/A fidelity and competence \ncoding procedures. Therapists trained in the UP-C/A will not administer \nthe RE intervention in order to prevent overlap between the two con-\nditions. IEs will (1) undergo comparable training, weekly monitoring, \nand fidelity checks, (2) score sample cases to demonstrate reliability, \nand (3) attend weekly cross-site calls to ensure accurate ratings under \nsupervision of the first author. All assessments will be video recorded, \nand 20% of interviews per year will be blindly reviewed to assess \ninterrater reliability. \n3.4. Treatment conditions \nThe UP-C/A and RE treatment protocols will include 10, 1-hour \nsessions. All participants in Phase 1 received the UP-C/A. Participants \nin Phase 2 (N 48) will be randomized to the UP-C/A (two-thirds) or the \nRE (one-third) condition (see Figure 1). The treatment protocols will \nvary in approach to treatment of misophonia, and there will be few \nshared features across protocols. Some common elements will include \nweekly parent/child top problem ratings to monitor change over time, \nmisophonia psychoeducation, and mindfulness skills. However, the \nintroduction of mindfulness will occur at significantly different time \npoints in treatment (session 3 for UP-C/A compared to session 8 for RE). \nBoth protocols are family-based and will include parent participation in \nevery session. These common elements are consistent with a basic CBT \nsession structure for treatment of emotional disorders. Importantly, \nthese similarities in structure will ensure RE is a rigorous control to the \nUP-C/A. \n3.5. The unified protocols for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional \ndisorders in children and adolescents (UP-C/A) \nProgression through treatment will include (1) learning about the \nemotional and behavioral underpinnings of emotions and misophonia; \nidentifying top problems and common triggers for the child/adolescent; \n(2) learning the relationship between sound triggers and automatic \nthoughts, feelings, and adaptive or maladaptive behaviors while also \npracticing “opposite action ” to the emotional behavior that occurs \nfollowing a sound trigger; (3) learning appropriate opposite action \nstrategies such as present moment awareness, non-judgmental aware -\nness, and awareness of physical sensations using interoceptive exposure \nwith body scans; (4) identifying thinking traps and employing detective \nthinking and problem-solving in response to automatic negative \nthoughts and difficult problems; (5) developing an emotion ladder for \ntrigger sounds; (6) exposure to trigger sounds while practicing response \nprevention; and (7) reviewing the treatment and planning for the future.

Children and adolescents with misophonia \npresent with heightened sensitivity to sound triggers and low tolerance \nto discomfort, especially emotional distress. Thus, exposure will be used \nas a mechanism to practice distress tolerance within an inhibitory \nlearning framework. Among the goals will be for the child to better \ntolerate emotional distress (to misophonic and other triggers) through \npractice with the therapist and at home through home learning assign -\nments. More detail about the UP-C/A can be found in published manuals \n(Ehrenreich et al., 2009) and the procedural adaptation for misophonia \nis provided in the context of a case paper from one of our pilot partici -\npants (Tonarely et al., 2021). \n3.6. Relaxation and education (RE) \nWe are using an active comparison condition in the randomized \nphase of the study. A relaxation-based treatment was chosen because (1) \nhigh rates of distress and anxiety are reported among youth with \nmisophonia, (2) there is skepticism about the appropriateness of \nexposure-based treatments within the misophonia patient community, \n(3) the chosen protocol was feasible in previous clinical trials, and (4) \nrelaxation-based treatments are often the cornerstone of anxiety treat-\nments outside of specialty exposure/response prevention practice. The \nspecific relaxation protocol chosen for this study was modified for a 10- \nweek format from the manual used by Piacentini et al. (2011). This \nprotocol has demonstrated a 35% response rate in comparison \nfamily-based exposure therapy (Piacentini et al., 2011). Progression \nthrough treatment will include (1) learning about misophonia and how \nto monitor it using a subjective units of distress scale; (2) rewarding the \nchild/adolescent’s use of relaxation strategies taught during treatment; \n(3) practicing a variety of relaxation strategies, including diaphragmatic \nbreathing, progressive muscle relaxation with combined muscle groups, \nguided imagery, combined progressive muscle relaxation with guided \nimagery, and mindfulness (body scanning, mindful eating, using the five \nsenses); and (4) reviewing the treatment and planning for the future. \nThis condition will not include exposure with response prevention \nstrategies. \n3.7. Results from a pilot implementation \nPhase 1 (completed) consisted of four pilot cases for the modified UP- \nC/A in order to test the feasibility of the 10-week protocol, assessment/ \nmeasurement, and supervision procedures. Families also provided their \ninput about the acceptability of the intervention. Mean age of pilot \nparticipants was 15.5 years and 75% of participants were female. \nTable 2 reflects the CGI-S/I scores at baseline and post-treatment for \neach participant’s misophonia symptoms and overall distress. All four \nyouth and their families completed the treatment with improved CGI-S/I \nscores (75% of participants were rated as “much improved” on the CGI-I \nMisophonia, which is considered a treatment responder). Table 3 re-\nflects the CSR misophonia ratings at baseline and post-treatment. Three \nout of four participants were rated as improved by 1-2 points at post- \ntreatment. Notably, the second participant ended treatment after ses-\nsion seven. Consequently, 2-3 fewer sessions of exposure were included, which might explain the less robust response (Misophonia CGI: mini-\nmally improved; Overall CGI: much improved; CSR: no change). \nAll participants completed the Misophonia Assessment Question -\nnaire (MAQ) and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (AMISO-S) at base-\nline and post-intervention. Table 4 shows the MAQ and AMISO-S raw \nscores from baseline to post-intervention for each participant. Three out \nof four participants rated improvement at post-intervention on the MAQ. \nBaseline scores ranged from 12 (mild) to 54 (extreme), while post- \ntreatment scores ranged from 3 (subclinical) to 25 (moderate). One \nparticipant (UM 2) reported worsening symptoms on the MAQ, but not \non the AMISO-S. All participants rated improvement at post-treatment \non the AMISO-S. Baseline scores ranged from 9 (mild) to 17 (severe), \nwhile post-treatment scores ranged from 6 (mild) to 12 (moderate). \nThe Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) Total \nAnxiety and Depression subscale and Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) \nTotal score were collected for most participants at baseline and post- \ntreatment in addition to the above noted misophonia-specific ques-\ntionnaires. Table 4 shows the RCADS T-scores and DTS raw scores from \nbaseline to post-treatment for each participant. These were collected to \nmeasure global improvements in distress tolerance, anxiety, and \ndepression given the comorbidities associated with misophonia. All \nparticipants’ total DTS scores increased somewhat at post-treatment, \nindicating improved tolerance to distress. DTS scores ranged from 31 \nto 73 at baseline and 38 to 75 at post-treatment. In addition, all par-\nticipants’ Total Anxiety and Depression T-scores on the RCADS \nimproved from baseline to post-treatment. T-scores ranged from 39 to 54 \nat baseline and 26 to 44 at post-treatment. Notably, no participants rated \nthemselves in the clinically significant range on the RCADS Total Anx-\niety and Depression subscale at baseline. USF 1 did not complete enough \nitems on the RCADS at baseline to generate a T-score. \nFamilies provided universally positive feedback in a brief follow-up \ncall with the study coordinator. More specifically, all participants pro-\nvided the highest acceptability ratings (i.e., 4/4) when asked to report \nabout the quality of the UP-C/A, whether they received the kind of \nservice they wanted, whether the UP-C/A helped them deal with their \nproblems more effectively, and whether the UP-C/A met their needs. In \naddition, all participants indicated they would definitely recommend \nthe study to a friend with a similar condition. All participants rated their \nquality of service as excellent. Minor modifications such as greater \nhomework specificity were noted by participants. Although not sur-\nprising, participants reported they disliked exposure, but they under -\nstood its utility and purpose. \nTable 2 \nCGI scores at baseline and post-treatment.   \nMisophonia Overall \nParticipant Baseline CGI-S Post CGI-S Post CGI-I Baseline CGI-S Post CGI-S Post CGI-I \nUM 1* Severe (6) Moderate (4) Much Improved (2) Severe (6) Moderate (4) Very Much Improved (1) \nUM 2 Severe (6) Moderate (4) Minimally Improved (3) Moderate (4) Moderate (4) Much Improved (2) \nUSF 1 Severe (6) Mild (3) Much Improved (2) Severe (6) Moderate (4) Much Improved (2) \nUSF 2 Moderate (4) Mild (3) Much Improved (2) Mild (3) Mild (3) Much Improved (2) \n*Note.

      "text": "Journal of Affective Disorders 291 (2021) 400–408\n4074.Discussion \nMisophonia is a condition that typically develops in adolescence and \nis marked by autonomic arousal, emotion dysregulation (e.g., anxiety, \nanger, irritability, rage), and distress intolerance in response to trigger \nsounds. Misophonia is thought to develop through a process of classical \nand operant conditioning wherein sounds are associated with distress \nand maladaptive behaviors are reinforced with escape. Further, miso-\nphonia often develops alongside other psychiatric disorders such as \nOCD, anxiety, and Tourette syndrome. Thus, transdiagnostic, family- \nbased CBT treatments that emphasize exposure and distress tolerance \nare a logical approach to treatment, particularly given that habituation \nto sounds per se is not an appropriate goal. \n4.1. Contributions \nThe current study is among the first studies of treatment of miso-\nphonia in youth and is the first proposed RCT to compare treatment \napproaches. The UP-C/A is an established transdiagnostic family-based \ntreatment for emotional disorders that emphasizes distress tolerance \nthrough opposite action using mindful approaches and exposure tech-\nniques. Some argue that exposure therapy is inappropriate for miso-\nphonia because habituation to sounds is unlikely. However, exposure \nmay in fact be a powerful agent of change for individuals with miso-\nphonia who have underdeveloped distress tolerance. Exposure is a \nprocess by which individuals learn how to withstand distress and \ndisconfirm prior beliefs about their ability to approach strong emotions. \nExposure therapy in this study is used as a tool to enhance distress \ntolerance, not as a mechanism to decrease arousal via repetitive en-\ncounters with a trigger stimulus. By contrast, relaxation also may be an \neffective treatment component for individuals with misophonia. Dif-\nferences in these potential active ingredients will be explored further \nthrough this RCT. Preliminary results suggest that individuals can \ntolerate distress associated with trigger sounds. \n4.2. Limitations \nThere are some notable limitations with regard to the current RCT. \nExtant literature does not provide direction for screening and diagnosis \nof misophonia. As such, the inclusion criteria for the study are broad, \nand the presentation and severity of misophonia among participants is \nvariable. Our diagnostic and assessment procedure had to be developed \nfor this study. Further, improvement in symptoms is difficult to oper-\nationalize given the lack of formal assessment procedures. We provi -\nsionally defined remission in symptoms in a manner consistent with \ntrials for childhood OCD, anxiety, and mood disorders. However, it is \nunclear if we can expect symptom remission for misophonia in a manner \nsimilar to internalizing neuropsychiatric conditions. \nAuthors’ contribution \nAll authors approved the final article. \nAdam B.
