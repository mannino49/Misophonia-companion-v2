The  study  will  also  examine  your  own  understanding  of  the  condition.  As  of  today,  \nthere  are  few  qualitative  studies  of  misophonia  and  none  that  examines  these  topics.  The  study  can  contribute  \nto  increasing  understanding  of  what  it  is  like  to  live  with  misophonia  and  will  be  a  unique  contribution  to  the  \nknowledge  base  about  the  phenomenon.\nThe  project  applied  for  will  investigate  how  people  with  misophonia,  i.e.  people  who  experience  strong  \ndiscomfort  when  exposed  to  certain  sounds,  experience  their  own  condition  and  experience  being  met  by  \nothers,  including  by  healthcare  personnel.  The  committee  believes  that  the  project  will  be  able  to  generate  \nknowledge  about  such  experiences  by  living  with  the  condition,  but  that  this  will  not  be  new  knowledge  about  \nillness  and  health  as  understood  in  the  Health  Research  Act.  The  committeeThe  term  has  apparently  reached  many  people  through  the  internet  and  in  recent  years  the  Norwegian  \nmedia  have  made  several  reports  about  people  who  experience  misophonia  as  a  major  burden  in  their  \neveryday  lives.  The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  obtain  more  knowledge  about  how  it  feels  to  live  with  \nmisophonia.  Interviews  will  be  conducted  with  people  who  state  that  they  suffer  from  misophonia  and  the  data  \nwill  be  analyzed  using  thematic  analysis.Institution  responsible  for  research:  University  of  Oslo\nREK's  assessmentMisophonia  is  a  little-explored  condition  that  has  received  increasing  scientific  attention  in  recent  decades.  \nMisophonia  is  characterized  by  the  fact  that  everyday  sounds  can  trigger  a  strong  negative  emotional  and  \nphysiological  response.  The  trigger  sounds  can  be  smacking,  eating,  chewing,  heavy  breathing  or  other  \nrepetitive  sounds  that  usually  come  from  other  people.\nREK  south-east  CApplication  number:  266604Marit  Råbu\nWe  refer  to  the  application  for  prior  approval  of  the  above-mentioned  research  project.

As  my  final  main  thesis,  I  will  carry  out  a  qualitative  study  of  experiences  with  misophonia.  In  this  \nstudy,  I  will  interview  people  who  suffer  from  misophonia  about  their  experiences  and  experiences  with  \nthe  condition.  The  purpose  of  the  study  is  to  obtain  more  knowledge  about  what  it  is  like  to  live  with  \nmisophonia  and  how  this  affects  those  who  suffer  from  it.  The  study  will  particularly  investigate  how  the  \nparticipants  are  met  by  other  people  when  it  comes  to  these  ailments.  The  topic  of  the  interview  will  \ntherefore  be  experiences  and  experiences  with  misophonia  in  meeting  with  other  people  -  such  as  in  \neveryday  situations  or  in  meeting  with  health  personnel.  I  therefore  want  to  get  in  touch  with  people  who  \nhave  misophonia  and  who  at  some  point  in  their  lives  have  considered  seeking  professional  help  because  \nof  this.  Current  participants  may  have  both  sought  help  for  misophonia,  or  only  considered  doing  so.
