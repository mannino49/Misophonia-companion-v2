The research further \nexplores how these sensory sensitivities impact daily functioning and how they may differ across genders in a \npediatric population.\nMethods: A total of 60 children aged 2–12 years, diagnosed with ASD, intellectual disability, borderline intel-\nlectual functioning, or co-occurring ADHD, participated in the study. Parental consent was obtained, and parents \ncompleted the Misophonia Impact and Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaires, which assess the presence and \nseverity of sound sensitivities. Data analysis included frequency distributions and Spearman ’s rank correlation to \nexamine potential associations between age and the severity of sensory symptoms.\nResults: The study found that 45 % of participants exhibited misophonia, and 38 % showed signs of hyperacusis. \nA slightly higher prevalence of misophonia and hyperacusis was observed in female participants (50 % and 43 %, \nrespectively) compared to males (43 % and 37 %, respectively). No significant correlation was found between the \nage of participants and the severity of misophonia (r 0.22, p F0.05) or hyperacusis (r 0.19, p F0.05).\nConclusions: Misophonia and hyperacusis are prevalent sensory challenges among children with ASD, with a \nslightly higher occurrence in females. These findings suggest that sensory sensitivities persist across develop -\nmental stages and may be more pronounced in females. Early identification and gender-sensitive, sensory- \nfocused interventions are critical for improving the quality of life and daily functioning of children with ASD. \nFuture research should explore the underlying mechanisms of these sensory sensitivities to enhance intervention \nstrategies across diverse populations.\n1.Introduction\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental \ncondition characterized primarily by social-communication challenges \nand restricted, repetitive behaviors, forming the core criteria for its \ndiagnosis. Variations in intellectual and language abilities contribute to \nthe diversity in ASD presentations [1,2]. Symptoms of ASD typically \nmanifest before age 3 and persist throughout life, though severity may \nvary over time [3]. ASD affects individuals across multiple domains, \nimpacting communication, reciprocal social interactions, and learning; \nthese limitations are compounded by repetitive or stereotyped behaviors \nthat vary widely among affected individuals [4,5].\nWhile the exact causes of ASD remain elusive, multiple risk factors \nhave been identified, including advanced paternal age, maternal health conditions (e.g., diabetes and thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy), \nand environmental exposures [6]. Genetic predisposition is also \nconsidered substantial, with recent research emphasizing the impor -\ntance of gene-environment interactions in ASD development [7,8]. \nAdditionally, emerging studies suggest that early-life environmental \nfactors, such as excessive screen time between ages 1–2, may contribute \nto the risk or exacerbation of ASD symptoms [9,10]. The global preva -\nlence of ASD is estimated at 1 in 100 children, making it a significant \npublic health concern [11,12].\nAtypical sensory processing is common in ASD, with many in-\ndividuals exhibiting sensitivity to environmental stimuli, such as \nsounds. Recent studies indicate that 50–70 % of individuals with ASD \nexperience decreased sound tolerance (DST), which can lead to \nconsiderable distress and functional impairment, manifesting in anxiety, \n*Corresponding author.

      "text": "behavioral challenges, and difficulties in community participation, ed-\nucation, and employment [13,14]. This hypersensitivity is particularly \nrelevant when exploring the link between ASD and misophonia, a con-\ndition characterized by extreme discomfort in response to specific \nsounds. In a recent study, Ertürk et al. identified a correlation between \nthe severity of misophonia symptoms and the presence of autistic traits, \nunderscoring the potential overlap in sensory processing differences \nacross these conditions [15,16].\nInvestigating the neurobiological mechanisms, developmental tra-\njectories, emotional and cognitive dimensions, and environmental trig-\ngers associated with sensory sensitivities in ASD is essential. Such \nresearch will not only deepen our understanding of ASD but also inform \neffective, culturally sensitive interventions tailored to diverse pop-\nulations [17,18]. This study aims to examine the relationship between \nmisophonia, hyperacusis, and ASD in Indian children aged 2–10 years \nand to compare these findings with data from Western populations. \nUnderstanding these cross-cultural presentations will provide valuable \ninsights into the impact of cultural context on sensory sensitivities in \nASD and guide intervention strategies globally [19,20].\n2.Methods\nThis study included 60 participants diagnosed with Spoken Language \nDisorder secondary to Autism Spectrum Disorder (SLD 2•to ASD), ASD \nwith Intellectual Disability (ID), ASD with Borderline Intellectual \nFunctioning (BIF), and ASD with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Dis-\norder (ADHD). Table 1provides a breakdown of these co-existing di-\nagnoses. Of the 60 participants, 14 were female, and 46 were male, with \nan age range of 2–12 years (mean age 5.8 years).\nThe target population included children with ASD, those exhibiting \nsignificant autistic features, or those with an autism component in di-\nagnoses involving ASD, ID, BIF, or ADHD. Parental consent was obtained \nfor all participants prior to study commencement.\nParents completed two questionnaires: the Misophonia Impact \nQuestionnaire (Parent version) and the Hyperacusis Impact Question -\nnaire (Parent version), developed by the Hashir International Specialist \nClinics and Research Institute for Misophonia, Tinnitus, and Hyperacusis \n[21]. The Misophonia Impact Questionnaire assesses responses to dis-\nliked sounds (e.g., cooker whistles, mixer grinders), including difficulty \nignoring these sounds, disruptions to daily activities, and feelings of \nanxiety, anger, irritation, or low mood. It also queries whether the \nparticipant avoids family members who speak loudly. The Hyperacusis \nImpact Questionnaire assesses discomfort, anxiety, fatigue, low mood, \nand difficulty with daily activities due to loud sounds, as well as chal-\nlenges in maintaining concentration. Both questionnaires are based on a \n4-point rating scale: 0–1 day (score 0), 2–6 days (score 1), 7–10 days \n(score 2), and 11–14 days (score 3), with each containing eight ques-\ntions. Completion of both questionnaires took approximately 15 min.\n3.Results\nThe results of the study showed that 27 out of 60 children showed \npresence of Misophonia. Out of 27, seven were females and 20 were \nmales. This shows that 50 % (7 out of 14) female children and 43 % (20 out of 46) male children reported of Misophonia (Fig. 1). We also found \nthat 23 out of 60 children showed presence of hyperacusis. Out of 23, six \nwere females and 17 were males. 43 % (6 out of 14) female children and \n37 % (17 out of 46) reported of hyperacusis (Fig. 2). This supports that \nthe prevalence of hyperacusis and misophonia was slightly more for \nfemale children with ASD compared to males.\nSpearman ’s rank correlation was done to determine if there is any \ncorrelation between the age of the participants and the misophonia and \nhyperacusis scores. The results of the study also showed that there was \nno correlation between the age of the participants and the misophonia \nscores (r 0.22, p F0.05) and hyperacusis scores (r 0.19, p F0.05).\n4.Discussion\nThe study results revealed that 45 % of children with Autism Spec-\ntrum Disorder (ASD) in the sample exhibited misophonia, while 38 % \ndemonstrated hyperacusis. Demopoulos and Lewine [22] reported that \n37 % of participants with ASD had sound sensitivity in at least one ear. \nDanesh et al. [23] found that 69 % of individuals with Asperger ’s Syn-\ndrome reported hyperacusis. A meta-analysis by Williams et al. [24] \nestimated the current prevalence of hyperacusis in individuals with ASD \nto be 41.42 % which is similar to results obtained in our study. Williams \net al. [25] examined the overlap between autistic traits and misophonia \nin adults and suggested that rates of autism might be elevated in in-\ndividuals with misophonia. While specific prevalence percentages in \nchildren with ASD were not provided, the study highlights a notable \nassociation. Further targeted studies are needed to provide precise \nprevalence rates for misophonia in individuals with ASD, particularly \namong children.\nIt was found in the study that 50 % of female participants (7 out of \n14) and 43 % of male participants (20 out of 46) were affected by \nmisophonia, suggesting a slightly higher prevalence in females with \nASD. Similarly, hyperacusis was observed in 43 % of female participants \nand 37 % of males, indicating a marginally higher occurrence in females. \nThis gender difference may reflect variations in sensory processing \namong children with ASD, as recent studies also report gender-based \ndifferences in sensory sensitivity and response patterns in ASD [19,26,\n27].\nSensory processing challenges, including hyperacusis and misopho -\nnia, are known to be prominent in children with ASD, impacting daily \nfunctioning and quality of life [24]. Such sensory sensitivities are linked \nto emotional distress, social withdrawal, and increased anxiety, making \ntargeted support essential for improving daily experiences for affected \nchildren [28,29]. Studies indicate that sensory processing difficulties in \nASD do not typically diminish over time but remain stable, as seen in the \nlack of correlation between participant age and the severity of miso-\nphonia (r 0.22, p F0.05) or hyperacusis (r 0.19, p F0.05) in this \nstudy. This finding supports prior work demonstrating that sensory \nsensitivities persist across developmental stages in ASD [30,31].\nThe slightly higher prevalence of misophonia and hyperacusis \namong female participants is noteworthy. Emerging research suggests \nthat females with ASD may experience greater sensory sensitivity than \ntheir male counterparts, which may exacerbate anxiety and affect social \nengagement, school participation, and functional outcomes [19,26]. \nGiven these findings, early identification and intervention for sensory \nsensitivities in ASD, particularly for females, may offer substantial \nbenefits.\nRecent studies advocate for sensory-focused therapies, which have \nshown promise in managing sensitivities and promoting better social \nintegration and emotional well-being [18,28]. Addressing these sensory \nneeds through personalized therapy could reduce behavioral challenges \nand enhance engagement in daily activities. However, further research \ninto the neurobiological underpinnings of sensory processing in ASD and \ngender-based response patterns is needed to guide more effective in-\nterventions across diverse populations [27,29].Table 1 \nNumber of children with associated clinical diagnoses.\nDiagnosis Number of children\nSLD 2•to ASD 42\nSLD 2•to ASD (?) 4\nSLD 2•to ASD with ID 7\nSLD 2•to ID with ASD 3\nSLD 2•to ASD with BIF 2\nSLD 2•to ASD with ADHD 1\nSLD 2•to ID 1\nBorderline SLD with ASD 1M.S.

Nearly half of the children displayed misophonia, while over a \nthird experienced hyperacusis, with a slightly higher prevalence \nobserved in female participants. This finding suggests that girls with \nASD may exhibit greater sensory sensitivity compared to boys.\nThe persistence of these sensory sensitivities, regardless of age, in-\ndicates the need for ongoing support as children with ASD grow. \nAddressing these sensory challenges is crucial, as they can contribute to \nincreased anxiety, social withdrawal, and difficulties with school and \ncommunity engagement. Early identification and intervention for these \nsensitivities could improve daily functioning and overall quality of life.\nImplementing sensory-focused therapies tailored to individual sen-\nsory profiles may help alleviate the impact of sensory sensitivities on \nthese children ’s lives. Future research should explore the underlying \nmechanisms of sensory processing in ASD and examine how cultural, \nenvironmental, and gender-related factors influence sensory responses. \nBy developing targeted and culturally responsive interventions, it is \npossible to support better outcomes and enhance the well-being of individuals with ASD globally.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nManasi Sadanand Katikar: Writing – review & editing, Writing – \noriginal draft, Visualization, Validation, Software, Project administra -\ntion, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, \nConceptualization.
