In this study, we aimed to \ninvestigate the possible associations of specific psychological traits with misophonic symptoms in psychiatric \noutpatients. \nSubjects: Misophonic Symptoms Checklist (MSC), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short Form \n(EPQRS), Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Buss-Perry \nAggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) were used to assess various \npsychological traits in a sample of consecutive outpatients at University Hospital Psychiatry Department in \nSeptember 2019. \nResults: After multiple regression analysis, we found that the MOCI, STAI, EPQRSneuroticism, SASS, and BPAQ \npredicted misophonic symptoms where only SASS and MOCI were significant predictors. \nConclusions: Our findings indicate that proneness to somatization and obsessivecompulsive symptoms are \nsignificantly associated with misophonic symptoms. These findings contribute to the phenomenological under -\nstanding of misophonia.   \n1.Introduction \nThe term misophonia was introduced by Jastreboff and Jastreboff to \ndescribe patients ‘who react negatively to specific sounds with specific \npatterns and/or meanings to individuals in specific situations ’ (Jas-\ntreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Although the first \ndescriptions of this condition stemmed from audiology literature related \nto hyperacusis; recently more evidence from neurophysiology and \nneurobiology research has supported its neuropsychiatric features and \ndiscussed it as a candidate neuropsychiatric disorder (Song et al., 2014 ; \nBrout et al., 2018 ). Currently, misophonia is still not classified as a \ndistinct psychiatric disorder in any diagnostic classification system \nthough it shares many aspects of a psychiatric disorder (Kumar et al., \n2017 ). \nMisophonia was described as abnormal or disproportionately aver-\nsive and emotional reactions to specific sounds, generally but not limited to the oral or nasal origin, which interfere with patients ’ psychosocial \nfunctioning (Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Taylor, 2017 ). Negative strong \nemotional and autonomic reactions such as the ‘fight or flight ’ response \nare elicited by specific stimuli called ‘trigger sounds ’ (Edelstein, Brang, \nRouw, & Ramachandran, 2013 ). Trigger sounds include breathing, \nwheezing, chewing, eating, slurping, lip-smacking, pen clicking/tap -\nping, typing, and cracking knuckles (Kumar et al., 2017 ; McKay, Kim, \nMancusi, Storch, & Spankovich, 2018 ). In some cases, images or visual \nstimuli such as leg-rocking, watching someone chewing, or \nhair-twiddling, could provoke similar emotional, behavioral, and \nphysiological reactions to trigger sounds (Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ). \nEmotional reactions to the stimuli vary from discomfort, anxiety, and \ndistress to irritation, disgust, hate, anger, feeling trapped, impatience \nand loss of self-control, and could even be related to the subject or \ncontext (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Schroder, Vulink, \n& Denys, 2013 ). Indeed, some authors suggested that aggressive \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: oguzhan2036@gmail.com (O.

Besides, physiological or autonomic reactions are reported to be \nimportant aspects of misophonia. Autonomic arousal in individuals with \nmisophonia causes a variety of symptoms, possibly due to activation of \nthe sympathetic nervous system activated by ‘trigger sounds ’ (Vidal, \nVidal, & Lage, 2010 ). Furthermore, misophonic patients were reported \nto have specific maladaptive coping mechanisms such as avoidance of \nsocial situations in which the trigger sound might occur, which in turn \ncould interfere with the interpersonal and occupational functioning of \nthe patient (Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Webber & \nStorch, 2014 ). \nPhenomenological features of misophonia have been associated with \na variety of psychiatric disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorders, \nagoraphobia, tic disorders, mood disorders, panic disorder, attention \ndeficit hyperactivity disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic dis-\norder, eating disorder, trichotillomania, skin picking, and autism spec-\ntrum disorders have been reported to have significant associations with \nmisophonic symptoms (Cavanna, 2014 ; Ferreira, Harrison, & Fonte -\nnelle, 2013 ; Hazen et al., 2008 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ; McGuire et al., \n2015 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Taylor, 2017 ; Taylor, Conelea, McKay, \nCrowe, & Abramowitz, 2014 ; Webber, Johnson, & Storch, 2014 ). \nThe variability of psychiatric symptoms associated with misophonia \nmight suggest a common physiopathology between misophonia and \npsychiatric disorders instead of accepting them as entirely distinct en-\ntities (Taylor, 2017 ). Research on potential intermediate phenotypes \nbetween misophonia and psychiatric disorders underlying both entities \ncan be valuable in this respect. Various psychological trait features are \ndefined for the underlying psychopathology of diverse psychiatric dis-\norders (Rosenstr om et al., 2019 ). For instance, previous research in-\ndicates anxiety, anger, obsessions, and avoidance behaviours which are \nalso common features in psychiatric disorders could be associated with \nmisophonia (Potgieter et al., 2019 ). \nPersonality, especially neurotic traits, is associated with a variety of \npsychiatric disorders (Calati et al., 2008 ; Celikel et al., 2009 ; Joyce, \nLight, Rowe, Cloninger, & Kennedy, 2010 ; Svrakic et al., 2002 ). Studies \nindicate that neuroticism is an important personality trait for general \npsychopathology risk (Ormel et al., 2013 ; Lahey, 2009 ). Psychoticism is \nrelated to tough-mindedness such as being intolerant, belittling, acting \ndisruptively, and lacking in empathy (Heath & Martin, 1990 ). Miso-\nphonic behaviours of the individuals can be disturbing to others via \nharsh criticism, anger outburst or failure of empathic understanding of \nreasonable explanations of the origins of misophonia trigger sounds such \nas making nasal sounds because of a rhino-sinusitis or hand-tapping due \nto exam anxiety. These behaviors can be understood as an expression of \npersonality that can be admitted to the psychoticism factor. Further -\nmore, personality is found to be important in noise sensitivity (Shep-\nherd, Heinonen-Guzejev, Hautus, & Heikkil a, 2015 ). According to this \nstudy, personality can have independent effects, accounted for 33% of \nthe variance, on noise sensitivity. A recent study indicates that sensi-\ntivity and emotional reactions towards unpleasant stimuli in misophonic \nindividuals might be related to neuroticism (Daniels, Rodriguez, & \nZabelina, 2020 ). Therefore, personality, especially neuroticism, could \nbe an important mediator on misophonic symptoms in psychiatric pa-\ntients which is worth investigating as a candidate trait. \nMisophonia was also shown to be related to obsessive and compul -\nsive symptoms, especially with obsessive thoughts (Cusack, Cash, & \nVrana, 2018 ). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms associated with ordering \nand harm avoidance dimensions, not compulsive symptoms such as \nhandwashing or neutralizing, are shown to be related to misophonia \n(McKay et al., 2018 ). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were also shown \nas a mediator between anxiety sensitivity and misophonic symptom \nseverity (Cusack et al., 2018 ). These significant results underline the \nimportance of obsessive and compulsive traits in misophonia. However, \nit is not well established that this is still the case for psychiatric patients \nthat can be valuable to investigate the associations between these conditions. Another important facet of misophonia could be aggressive \ntraits. However, trait aggression is not investigated and most of the \nstudies were focused on state anger to misophonic triggers (Wu, Lewin, \nMurphy, & Storch, 2014 ; Zhou, Wu, & Storch, 2017 ). \nAnxiety is an expected response due to trigger sounds associated with \nmisophonia Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ). However, little is known about \nthe relations between trait anxiety and misophonia. In a recent study, \nbaseline anxiety (pre-stimulus anxiety level) was found to be directly \nrelated to emotional responses towards trigger sounds associated with \nmisophonia (Daniels et al., 2020 ). Anxiety was also shown to be an \nimportant mediator for aggressive reactions towards misophonic sounds \n(Wu et al., 2014 ). Anger reactions towards others were also found to be \nassociated with misophonia (McKay et al., 2018 ). But it is not clear that \nanger reactions are a state or a trait feature in misophonia. So, both trait \nanxiety and aggression could be important features associated with \nstrong aversive emotions and associated behaviors due to misophonic \ntrigger sounds in psychiatric patients. \nSomatosensory amplification is another trait feature that could be \nassociated with misophonia (Barsky, Goodson, Lane, & Cleary, 1988 ; \nVenugopal, Mohan, & Chaturvedi, 2006 ). Somatosensory amplification \nis defined as a general disposition to experience ordinary bodily sensa -\ntions as uncomfortable and disturbing. Besides, sensations that are \nmildly noxious or disturbing might be experienced as very painful and \ncatastrophic via the somatosensory amplification process. Somatosen -\nsory amplification is a neurobiologically valid and widely accepted \nfeature in the pathophysiology of somatic symptom and related disor -\nders (Nakao & Barsky, 2007 ; Çolak et al., 2021 ). Somatosensory \namplification could interfere with normal sensory processing probably \nwith associated affective and cognitive outcomes (Koteles & Witth oft, \n2017 ). Indeed, sensory processing is defined as sequential neural pro-\ncessing for organizing visceral and autonomic sensations from ones ’ own \nbody and the external world (Williams, Tinley, & Curtin, 2010 ), and \ndeficits of sensory processing were suggested as a candidate mediator in \nthe pathophysiology of misophonia (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Moreover, in \na recent study, misophonia was found to be associated with physical \nconcerns which are defined as sensitivity towards interoceptive sensa -\ntions as a part of anxiety sensitivity (McKay et al., 2018 ). Therefore, \nsomatosensory amplification would be suggested as a potential trait \nfeature in association with misophonic symptoms. \nEvidence suggests that misophonic symptoms, although they fluc-\ntuate slightly over time, emerge in adolescence and tend to have a \nchronic course; this, in turn, could be viewed as evidence that certain \npsychological traits could be features of misophonia (Rouw & Erfanian, \n2018 ; Siepsiak & Dragan, 2019 ). However, the association of miso-\nphonic symptoms with other psychological traits has still not been \ninvestigated. As mentioned above, misophonia could potentially be \nrelated to personality (especially with neurotic traits), anxiety prone -\nness, obsessiveness, and aggressive tendencies. Furthermore, somato -\nsensory amplification could be an important candidate for the sensory \nprocessing deficits in misophonia. A coherent picture of the relations \nbetween associated psychological traits and misophonia can give valu-\nable insights into the underlying causes of this intractable condition. \nAdditionally, results are far from to be conclusive due to the lack of \nstudies from clinical populations. Trait phenotypes associated with \npsychiatric disorders can be valuable in this respect. \nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the associations of specific \npsychological trait variables with misophonic symptoms in psychiatric \noutpatients. We hypothesized that misophonic symptoms could be \npositively associated with neuroticism, trait anxiety, obsessiveness, \nanger, and somatosensory amplification in psychiatric outpatients and \npredicted by them.

Participants \nOur study was carried out in the outpatient psychiatry clinic at \nUniversity Hospital in Turkey in September 2019. The aim was to enroll \nenough number of consecutive outpatients who fulfill the inclusion \ncriteria according to the calculated sample size. Patients with a mini-\nmum of five years of education (primary education level in the country) \nwere asked to participate in the study. Patients diagnosed with psychotic \ndisorders, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, cognitive disorders, \nand alcohol/drug-related disorders and marked to severely symptomatic \npatients were also excluded (mildly symptomatic patients were \nincluded). \n2.2. Procedure \nPatients received information about the study and invited to \nparticipate. Written and verbal informed consents were obtained from \npatients who agreed to participate to the study. Diagnostic assessments \nwere conducted according to the established routines in the outpatient \nclinic and assessments for inclusion and exclusion to the study were \ndone by experienced psychiatrists. Patients who were eligible filled the \nmeasures of the study in a single session on the day of their routine \npsychiatric assessments and treatments. The study has been approved by \nthe local ethics committee. \n2.3. Measures \n2.3.1. Sociodemographic data collection \nInformation about the age, gender, marital, educational, and occu-\npational status of the participants was obtained. \n2.3.2. Misophonic Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) \nMisophonic Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) is a 4-point Likert type \nscale developed by (Oz & Kılıç, 2017 ). The checklist assesses both types \nand severity of misophonic symptoms and includes 50 different sounds. \nThe total score will be between 0 and 150; with higher scores indicating \nmore severe misophonic symptoms. Psychometric assessments of the \nMSC has shown that the scale is both valid and reliable in assessing \nmisophonic symptoms. \n2.3.3. Eysenck personality questionnaire revised-short form (EPQRS) \nThe Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised-Short Form (EPQR- \nS) is a self-report screening tool designed to assess three dimensions of \npersonality; extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. The instru -\nment consists of 6 yes/no questions for each personality dimension with \n6 additional questions belonging to the lying subscale for testing social \ndesirability bias. The questionnaire was developed by Eysenck and \nEysenck (1975) and was revised by Francis, Brown, and Philipchalk \n(1992) . The validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of \nEPQRS was done by Karanci (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975 ; Francis et al., \n1992 ; Karancı, Dirik, & Yorulmaz, 2007 ). \n2.3.4. Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) \nMaudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) was developed \nby Hodgson and Rachman and is designed to measure subsets of \nobsessive-compulsive symptoms (Hodgson & Rachman, 1977 ). MOCI \ncomprises 30 yes/no items grouped into four subscales and higher scores \nindicate more serious obsessive-compulsive traits. The Turkish version \nof the inventory has been shown to have adequate validity and reli-\nability in a study conducted by Erol and Savasir (Erol & Savasir, 1989 ). \nIn the Turkish form, seven items from the Minnesota Multiphasic Per-\nsonality Inventory (MMPI) was added. 2.3.5. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) \nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was developed by Spielberger \nand Gorsuch and aims to measure both state and trait anxiety levels of \nindividuals (Gaudry, Vagg, & Spielberger, 1975 ). The Turkish version \nhas adequate psychometric properties shown in a study by Oner (Oner, \n1997 ). The instrument comprises 40 items grouping into two distinct \ncategories: state and trait. The trait anxiety part of STAI was used in this \nresearch which comprises a total of 20 questions. Higher scores indicate \nhigher trait anxiety. \n2.3.6. Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) \nBuss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) was developed by Buss \nand Perry and revised by them in 1992 (Buss & Perry, 1992 ). It measures \n4 dimensions of personality: physical and verbal aggression, rage, and \nhostility. The instrument comprises 29 5-point Likert-type items. Higher \nscores indicate higher levels of aggression. The Turkish version of BPAQ \nhad high internal consistency (Chronbach ’s alpha .85) and stability \n(reliability coefficients 0.97) (Demirtas-Madran, 2012 ). \n2.3.7. Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) \nSomatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) was developed to assess \nthe amplification of various somatic and visceral sensations that are not \nthe symptoms of serious diseases. It measures various domains from \nbodily and visceral sensations such as auditory, visual, noxious, or \nvisceral sensory modalities. It was created by Barsky and translated to \nTurkish by Güleç & Sayar (Barsky, Wyshak, & Klerman, 1990 ; Güleç & \nSayar, 2007 ) with high internal consistency (Chronbach ’s alpha .78) and \ntest-retest reliability (0.73). The instrument comprises 10 5-point Likert \ntype items. The score ranges from 10 to 50 points. Individuals with \nhigher scores are more prone to perceive somatic sensations as more \nintense and disturbing. \n2.4. Statistical analyses \nDescriptive variables were given by mean SD, n (%) or median \n(range), appropriately. T-tests were conducted for MSQ scores in de-\nmographic groups. Pearson or Spearman correlation was performed to \ninvestigate the association between misophonic symptoms and MOCI, \nEPQRS, BPAQ, STAI, SASS according to the normality assumptions, \nappropriately. Mann-Whitney U and independent samples t-tests were \nconducted for group comparisons in terms of MSQ scores and admission \nstatus (first admission or one than more admission) and medication \nstatus (use or no-use), respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses \nwere performed to explore independent associations between each risk \nvariable as a predictor of MSQ using the ‘enter method ’. All the pre-\ndictors in a block were entered in a single step. MOCI, EPQRS- \nneuroticism, BPAQ, STAI, and SASS were included as independent var-\niables in the model. Multicollinearity analyses were conducted for \ntesting possible correlations between these variables. Total sample size \nof n 138 was calculated by g-power program (effect size f2 0.15, α \nerr prob 0.05, power 0.95 with 5 predictors). Data of patients with \nmissing values were excluded from further analyses (n: 23). All statis -\ntical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social \nScience (SPSS, version 23.0 for Windows). A p-value of D.05 was \nconsidered to be statistically significant. \n3.Results \nA total of 163 patients enrolled in the study and data from 140 pa-\ntients were included in the final analyses. MSQ scores were not signifi -\ncantly different according to socio-demographic variables as gender \n(t \u00000.622; p .535), educational (F 1.735; p .180), marital \n(t \u00000.091; p .928) and occupational (t 0.516; p .626) status. \nOverall, 120 patients (85.7%) were under follow-up and 20 patients \n(14.3%) were during first admission. There was no difference between \nthese groups in terms of MSQ scores (Z \u00000.569, p .570). Diagnosis of B. Çolak et al."

Other character traits, extraversion \n(rho \u00000.107; p .221) and psychoticism (rho 0.050; p .566), were not related with MSQ scores. Age was not related with MSQ \n(r 0.131; p .125). Age was inversely correlated with BPAQ \n(r \u00000.215; p .013) but not with MOCI (r 0.104; p .225), EPQRS- \nneuroticism (rho \u00000.113; p .198), STAI(r 0.028; p .748) and \nSASS (r 0.129; p .137). Correlations of MOCI, EPQRS, BPAQ, STAI \nand SASS between MSQ were given in Table 2. \nAnalysis conducted to see if the data met the assumption of collin -\nearity indicated that multicollinearity was not a concern (BPAQ, \nTolerance 0.77, VIF 1.28; SASS, Tolerance 0.72, VIF 1.372; \nSTAI, Tolerance 0.44, VIF 2.24; MOCI, Tolerance 0.43, \nVIF 2.32; EPQRS-neuroticism, Tolerance 0.60, VIF 1.64). In the \nmultiple regression analyses, these variables significantly predicted \nMSQ scores and explained 32.5% of the variance (R2 0.352, F \n(5,119) 12.953, p D.001). The analysis shows that STAI (Beta 0.04, \nt(124) 0.32, p .747), BPAQ (Beta 0.15, t(124) 1.74, p .083), \nEPQRS-neuroticism (Beta \u00000.13, t(124) \u00001.40, p .162) did not \nsignificantly predict MSQ scores, however only SASS (Beta 0.39, t \n(124) 4.52, p D.001) and MOCI (Beta 0.25, t(124) 2.25, p .026) \nscores were the significant predictors in the full model (see Table 3). \n4.Discussion \nIn this study, we investigated the association of trait psychological \nvariables with misophonic symptoms and significant correlations were \nfound between misophonic symptoms and various psychological trait \nvariables such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, neuroticism, trait \nanxiety, somatosensory amplification, and aggression in non-psychotic \npsychiatric outpatients. No significant correlations were found be-\ntween misophonic symptoms and the other personality dimensions \nnamely extraversion and psychoticism. Sociodemographic and clinical \nvariables were not associated with MSQ scores. Multiple regression \nanalyses showed that a full model consisting of scores of EPQRS- \nneuroticism, BPAQ, STAI, SASS, and MOCS significantly predicted the \nmisophonic symptoms. However, MOCS and SASS remained to be sig-\nnificant in the full model even after adjustment. This is the key finding of \nour study which requires further consideration. \n4.1. Neuroticism and misophonia \nNeuroticism, not psychoticism or extraversion, correlated signifi -\ncantly with misophonia symptoms. Previous studies indicate personality \ncould be an important mediator on noise sensitivity (Stansfeld, Clark, \nJenkins, & Tarnopolsky, 1985 ; Stansfeld, 1992 ). Also, neuroticism was \nshown to be positively related to noise sensitivity where extraversion \nwas inversely related (Dornic & Ekehammar, 1990 ). However, this was \nnot replicated in another study (Shepherd et al., 2015 ). To our knowl -\nedge, the only study on the association between neuroticism and miso-\nphonia was conducted by Daniels et al. (2020) . The primary measure of \nthe study was not assessing personality but neuroticism was used as a \ncovariate. In that study, neuroticism was found to be related both to \nsound sensitivity and emotional behaviours towards misophonia trigger \nsounds. Therefore, our results were in line with the findings of the \naforementioned study. As a general risk factor towards psychiatric dis-\norders, neuroticism could be accepted as an important psychological \ntrait towards misophonia; however, it did not remain as a significant \npredictor in the full regression model. So, to our opinion, this finding \nindicates that misophonia is a stable and distinct entity irrespective of \npersonality. To our knowledge, ours was the first study that reports an \nassociation between misophonia symptoms and neuroticism in a clinical \ngroup. This finding needs to be replicated in further studies both for \nclinical and non-clinical samples. \n4.2.

(2014) have previously \nreported a significant association between anger outbursts and miso-\nphonia. In this study, also anxiety was a mediator for anger reactions \ntowards misophonia. Similar results were also shown in another study \n(Zhou et al., 2017 ). In these studies, the ‘Rage Outbursts and Anger \nRating Scale ’ were used to assess symptoms in the previous weeks unlike \nour assessment with BPAQ which reflects trait aggression. Aggressive -\nness was not also a robust feature in another study although mild cor-\nrelations towards misophonia were observed (McKay et al., 2018 ). \nTherefore, our results are in line with this finding that trait aggression is \nnot a robust predictor of misophonia. It can be concluded that there are \nother possible mediators towards anger that could explain the mecha -\nnism of misophonia. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first \nstudy that assessed the relation between trait aggression and misopho -\nnia. Future studies should be conducted to explore the role of trait \naggression either as an exogenous or endogenous risk factor for miso-\nphonia related behaviours. \n4.3. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and misophonia \nWe also found a significant association between misophonic and \nobsessive-compulsive symptoms, as measured by MOCI and it remained \nas one of the significant predictors in the full regression model. This \nfinding is in line with previous researches that obsessiveness is an \nimportant feature of the cognitive model of misophonia (Cusack et al., \n2018 ; McGuire et al., 2015 ; Siepsiak & Dragan, 2019 ). Although \ndifferent scales such as ‘Obsessive-compulsive inventory revised ’ and \nMOCI were used in different populations (e.g. clinical, \npopulation-based); it seems to be a robust finding that misophonia has \nrelations to obsessive-compulsive traits in the clinical group. \n4.4. Trait anxiety and misophonia \nPrevious studies have reported an association between higher levels \nof anxiety and misophonia symptoms (Quek et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., \n2014 ), prompting a discussion of misophonia symptoms as a possible \nconsequence of anxiety. However, these studies have used a time scale \nwhich only assessed anxiety levels during the previous weeks. We found \na significant correlation between misophonia symptoms and trait anxiety which is defined as an inclination to react anxiously towards \ngeneral distress. In a recent study conducted by Daniels et al. (2020) , \ntrait anxiety was found to be not correlated with misophonic symptom \nseverity; probably due to methodological issues such as sampling and \npsychometric measures. \nOn the other hand, the association between anxiety and misophonia \nis complicated which needs further elaboration. In our study, trait \nanxiety was mildly correlated with misophonia severity. However, it \nwas not found to be a significant predictor in the full regression model. \nTherefore, different dimensions of anxiety should be taken into account \n(Mcwilliams & Brian, 2001 ). For instance, anxiety sensitivity was sug-\ngested as an associated feature of misophonia severity (Cusack et al., \n2018 ). Anxiety sensitivity in misophonia could be defined as a fear of \nfear towards arousal related experiences, as unpleasant sounds in \nmisophonia, which in turn leads to aggressive reactions for coping with \nthe disturbing sensations (Wu et al., 2014 ). Although we did not have \nany measures to evaluate anxiety sensitivity, it may have some sub-\nstantial effect on misophonia severity (as discussed later). Nonetheless, \nwe showed the first evidence that misophonic sensitivity has a signifi -\ncant positive correlation with trait anxiety in psychiatric outpatients. \nFuture studies should focus on the association between different di-\nmensions of anxiety and misophonia. \n4.5. Somatosensory amplification and misophonia \nWe found that the severity of somatosensory amplification was \nsignificantly associated with misophonic symptoms even in the fully \nadjusted statistical models. McKay et al. (2018) showed that physical \nconcerns as sensitivity towards interoceptive sensations discriminated \nindividuals with misophonia from non-misophonics (McKay et al., \n2018 ). In that study, Anxiety Sensitivity Index –3 was used to assess the \nthree dimensions (cognitive, social, and physical) of anxiety. Further -\nmore, Bodily Perception Scale scores which was also another measure \nfor bodily sensations and interoceptive signals was found to have sig-\nnificant correlations with misophonic symptoms in that study. In a \nprevious study, dispositional interoceptive focus, as indicated by body \nawareness, was shown to be an important facet of somatosensory \namplification (Koteles & Doering, 2016 ). All these results could indicate \na salient overlap between somatosensory amplification and anxiety \nsensitivity. \nAccording to Perez, Barsky, Vago, Baslet, and Silbersweig (2015) , \ninteractions between enhanced cortical or subcortical sensory process -\ning, cognitive evaluation, and affective modification of visceral or pe-\nripheral stimuli lead to the way to somatosensory amplification. \nAttentional bias, negative anticipation, catastrophizing, negative mood \nwhich also constitute the core features of misophonia are all proposed to \nbe related to somatosensory amplification (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Pot-\ngieter et al., 2019 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). Indeed, evidence from \nneuroscientific research could contribute to our findings. For instance, \nin a recent fMRI study, anterior insula which has a pivotal role in the Table 2 \nCorrelations of variables with MSQ.   \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \n1.MSQ                 \n2.BPAQ .310b               \n3.SASS .546b .323b             \n4.STAI .362b .312b .429b           \n5.MOCI .431b .310a .483b .695b         \n6.

These brain regions are also associated with the neural \nnetwork of somatosensory amplification (Boeckle, Schrimpf, Liegl, & \nPieh, 2016 ; Bourke, Langford, & White, 2015 ; Perez et al., 2015 ). This \noverlap can be an important missing link in the pathophysiology of \nmisophonia as a candidate feature in this respect. For example, trait \nanxiety was shown to be related to enhanced functional connectivity \nbetween insula and periaqueductal gray matter that leads to increased \npain perception via its effect on thalamo-cortical sensory gating (Perez \net al., 2015 ). Somatosensory amplification with its cognitive amplifiers \nand affective modifiers which interfere with enhanced auditory pro-\ncessing could be the basis of anxiety sensitivity in this regard. To our \nknowledge, ours is the first study that indicates a possible link between \nsomatosensory amplification and misophonia and this should be inves -\ntigated in further studies. \n4.6. Limitations \nAlthough there is a growing interest in misophonia, the basis of its \nmechanism is still in nascent stages. Research on underlying interme -\ndiate phenotypes is valuable in this respect. We have investigated \nprominent psychological traits associated with misophonia in a psy-\nchiatric outpatient sample, however with some limitations. First, the \ngeneralizability of our findings to all psychiatric patients is limited since \nthe study sample consisted of outpatients in a single university hospital \npsychiatry department, and due to the exclusion of psychotic or other \nsevere psychiatric disorders. Second, some of our findings might be due \nto the number of analyses being carried out and represent type I statis -\ntical error. So, this limitation should be bear in mind when interpreting \nour results. Third, even though we are reporting preliminary evidence \nfor trait features for misophonia; state assessments still need to be \nconsidered in understanding misophonia. For instance; depressed mood \ncould interfere with self-reported psychological variables. For mini-\nmizing the impact of state variables, we only enrolled patients who were \nmildly symptomatic and we have excluded severe psychiatric disorders. \nAlthough diagnoses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or anxiety \ndisorders could have a stronger inclination towards misophonia; due to \nthe heterogeneity of the psychiatric diagnoses in our sample, it sounds \nmethodologically not feasible to control diverse psychiatric symptoms. \nFourth, self-report nature of the scales might interfere with the out-\ncomes. Finally, the cross-sectional methodology in our study does not \nallow us to draw conclusions about causality. \n4.7. Conclusion and future directions \nOurs is the first study reporting associations between trait psycho -\nlogical features and misophonic symptoms in a sample consisted of \npsychiatric outpatients. In line with previous reports in non-clinical \npopulation we have demonstrated that obsessive and compulsive traits \nare also significant in the clinical population. Finally, we have found \nsome evidence regarding somatosensory amplification which has some \noverlaps with anxiety sensitivity as a possible explanation for the eti-\nology. These findings might contribute to the understanding of miso-\nphonia as a phenomenological/clinical entity. Future studies are \nwarranted to investigate the roles of these constructs, especially re-\nlations between somatosensory amplification, obsessive-compulsive \ntraits, anxiety sensitivity as well as different aspects of misophonia. \nRole of funding sources \nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding \nagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
