When exposed to specific audi -\ntory triggers, people with misophonia exhibit various physi-\nological and emotional responses, including an accelerated \nheart rate, sweating, anxiety, rage, irritability, and disgust \n[1]. Since triggers are very much common in misophonic \nindividuals, they can lead to social isolation and psycho-\nlogical problems. The types of aversive triggers vary from individual to individual and depend on various factors, such \nas experience, social context, and the psychological profile \nof the person [1 ]. The sounds created by the human mouth \nor nose, such as chewing, breathing sounds, and sniffing, \nare the most unpleasant of the many triggers that have been \nfound.\nMisophonia can occur on its own as a distinct disorder \nor in conjunction with other psychiatric disorders, such as \nobsessive–compulsive disorders (OCD), attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mood disorders. In \naddition, misophonia often coexists with other similar condi -\ntions, such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, and phonophobia, which \nis necessary to differentiate [1 ]. The onset of the problem \nin misophonia patients has been reported variably across \nthe literature. Few studies have mentioned that the onset is \nduring adolescence [2 ], few authors have mentioned during \nadulthood [ 3], and few have mentioned that there are no age \ncriteria for the occurrence of misophonia as it can happen at \nany age [4 ].

Similarly, Naylor et al. reported clini-\ncally significant misophonia in 49.1% of the study sample \npopulation among the U.K. undergraduate medical student \npopulation [6 ]\nMisophonia is an adverse reaction to sounds driven by \nenhanced limbic and autonomic responses without exces-\nsive auditory system amplification [7 ]. Due to the interac-\ntion between the limbic system and the classical and non-\nclassical pathways, a breakdown in this process may increase \nthe emotional and autonomic response to auditory inputs \n[7]. According to Jastreboff (1990) and Jastreboff and Jas-\ntreboff (2002)'s neurophysiological model, misophonia is \na dislike or hatred of sound that is caused by abnormally \nstrong reactions of the autonomic and limbic systems as a \nresult of enhanced connections between the auditory, limbic, \nand autonomic systems or enhanced reactivity of the limbic \nand autonomic system to sound [8 , 9]\nThe neuroimaging studies employing functional magnetic \nresonance imaging (fMRI) showed hyperactivation of the \nright insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, and right supe-\nrior temporal cortex with misophonic video clips compared \nto neutral video clips [10, 11]. In misophonic patients, trig-\nger sounds also increased heart rate (H.R.) and galvanic skin \nresponse (GSR), which were mediated by anterior insular \ncortex (AIC) activity [11]. Similarly, Schröder et al. revealed \nthat the misophonic group's mean N1 peak amplitude was \nlower than the control group, suggesting that misophonic \npeople may have low-level auditory information process-\ning deficits [12]. The right superior temporal cortex, right \nanterior insular cortex, and right anterior cingulate showed \ngreater activity in the misophonic group than in the control \ngroup [ 10]. Similarly, Giorgi et al. found hyperactivation of \nthe bilateral auditory cortex and left amygdala when exposed \nto the misophonic triggers compared to the control group \n[13].\nRationale and justification of the study\nAlthough misophonia has undergone substantial advance-\nment, neither the Diagnostic nor Statistical Manual of Men-\ntal Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) nor the International \nClassification of Diseases, Eleventh Edition recognize miso-\nphonia as a distinct illness (ICD-11). However, misophonia \nis now recognized by Schröder et al. as a specific psychiat-\nric condition rather than a symptom of other disorders, and \nthey have provided diagnostic criteria to support this claim \n[14]. Few questionnaires were developed to assess misopho-\nnia [15, 16]. Amsterdam misophonia scale (A-MISO-S) is \nthe checklist developed by Schröder et al. for assessing the \nseverity of symptoms along the dimensions of the proposed criteria for misophonia and has also been used widely across \nthe literature [14].\nEven though few questionnaires were developed to deter -\nmine the severity of misophonia symptoms, this scale's psy -\nchometric properties are unknown. To conduct a full assess-\nment of misophonia, administering these questionnaires is \ninsufficient. We have to rule out the other diagnostic condi-\ntion that may account for sound sensitivity by administering \nprimary diagnostic tools that may be necessary. As misopho-\nnia borders audiology and psychiatry, audiological assess-\nment is mandatory for misophonia patients. Brout et al. had \nmentioned in their paper that there can be a central auditory \nprocessing disorder in individuals with misophonia, and \nthere is a need for research from audiological perspectives \n[17]. The audiological evaluation of misophonia is chal-\nlenging, and there is no established technique. As a result, \nthere is a huge demand for research on misophonia from an \naudiological standpoint.\nThe complex nature of misophonia has made it a stressful \ndisorder for sufferers and family members. However, little \nresearch is about underlying pathophysiological mecha-\nnisms, assessment, and management. To date, no specific \nprotocols have been developed for misophonia assessment \nand management. Proper assessment and management of \nmisophonia are impossible without understanding its core \nmechanism. Misophonia is still in its infancy and is not read-\nily accepted in the scientific community as a valid disorder. \nTherefore, it can be hypothesized that highlighting more \non the neurophysiological mechanism will help recognize \nmisophonia as a separate and genuine disorder and provide a \npath for assessment and management using a team approach. \nHence, this review aims to highlight the Neuroaudiological \npathophysiology of misophonia and its implications in the \nassessment and management of misophonia from an audio-\nlogical perspective.\nMethods\nThe study was conducted after registration in the PROS -\nPERO (Regd ID: CRD42021279965). The review was \ncarried out using Preferred Reporting Items for System-\natic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in \nvarious databases for literature search [ 18]. These databases \nincluded African Journal Online (AJOL), Google Scholar, \nPubMed (National Centre for Biotechnology Information), \nMEDLINE (U.S. National Library of Medicine), Web of \nScience, Elsevier, Schematic Scholar, Cochrane library, \nand Comdisdome.

Twelve articles meeting the inclu-\nsion criteria for complete reading were finalized for review. \nAll the studies included in the study were experimental. The \nselection process was further validated by inter-judge selec-\ntion and discussion in case any ambiguity arose in finalizing \nthe published manuscript. The detailed Preferred Reporting \nItems for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) flow diagram for \nthe selection of studies was used for the present systematic \nreview which is mentioned in Fig.  1\nResult of quality analysis after data extraction\nQUADAS-2: A Revised Tool for the Quality Assessment \nof Diagnostic Accuracy Studies [19] was used to determine \nthe quality and strength of the study selected for the review. \nAll the studies were experimental designs using calibrated instrumentation, standardized questionnaires, and proper \nmethodology. Almost all the studies were well-controlled, \nwith proper selection and representativeness of cases and \ncontrols. There was good control of the study factors almost \nin all the studies with a low risk of bias. However, most of \nthe studies lack the identification of the additional and con-\nfounding factors that might have deviated from the results \nand accounting for the same while analyzing the results. \nThe summary of the quality analysis of selected studies is \nshown in Table  1.\nSummary of data extraction\nSelected studies mainly consisted of experimental stud-\nies. All the subjects included in the study were diagnosed \nwith misophonia using standardized diagnostic protocols. \nDifferent standardized questionnaires, such as the Amster -\ndam Misophonia Questionnaire [20] and the Misophonia \nQuestionnaire (MQ) [15] have been used in most studies to \ndifferentiate the misophonia group from the control group.\nVarious modifications of the neuroimaging method such \nas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural \nfMRI, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, \nsound-evoked fMRI, fMRI acquisition using BOLD during \na stop-signal task (SST), fMRI acquisition during the per -\nformance of the visual stop-signal task and so on has been \nused in most of the studies to find the neurological patho-\nphysiology of the misophonia [11, 15, 20, 21]. Along with \nthat, evoked response potential (ERP) during the oddball \ntask using electroencephalography (EEG) and comparison \nof Skin conductance response (SCR) among auditory and \nvisual stimuli has also been used in a few studies to find the \nsite of lesion in the misophonia participants [22, 23].\nNeuroaudiological pathophysiology found \nacross studies\nThe functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) para-\ndigm with different modifications has been used as the \npreferred method in ten selected studies to determine the \nsize of the lesion by comparing misophonia participants \nwith the control group.

In addition, fMRI analysis showed greater \nwhite matter volume in the left frontal cortex, including the \narea of inferior frontal–occipital fasciculus (IFOF), anterior \nthalamic radiation (ATR), and the body of the corpus cal-\nlosum (BCC) in the misophonic participants compared to \nthe control.

From the liter -\nature review and the author's understanding, the neuroaudio-\nlogical model has been formulated to understand misophonia \nfrom the audiological perspective, as illustrated in Fig.  2.\nDiscussion\nThe present systematic review aimed to study the neuroau-\ndiological pathophysiology of misophonia. The result of the \nreview revealed abnormal activation and connection among \nthe different higher cortical structures in participants with \nmisophonia. Different methods used for studying the brain \nbasis of misophonia have been explored. Across the studies, \nvarious neurophysiological, neurobiological, neuroimaging, \nand autonomic measures have been explored to find the brain \nfunctioning of the individual with misophonia. Across the studies, the subjective response to the misophonics is cor -\nrelated with the physiological measurement of increased \nautonomic arousal in response to the misophonic triggers, \nwhich validates the experience of sufferers. These findings \ndemonstrate misophonic trigger atypical sympathetic arousal \nand negative conditioning.\nSimilarly, across the neuroimaging studies, it was found \nthat misophonics showed an atypical neuronal and physical \nresponse, which again validates that the condition is real and \nspecial attention is needed to develop the assessment and \nmanagement strategies. Neurobiological studies showed cen-\ntral auditory processing impairment in misophonics.

The Anterior Insular Cortex (AIC) showed \nincreased neural activity in the fMRI study by Kumar et al., \nemploying the unpleasant trigger sounds, which are regarded \nas the most substantial evidence supporting the neurological \netiology of misophonia [27]. Since the AIC is the central \nregion in charge of emotional awareness, we might anticipate \nthat this region will respond more strongly when exposed to \ntrigger sounds.\nAnother fMRI study by Giorgi discovered that when an \nindividual with misophonia is exposed to auditory triggers, \nthe left amygdala and bilateral auditory cortex become \nhyperactive [13]. Schröder et al. reported similar findings \nas well [28]. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), \na node of the default mode network, has more gray matter \ndemyelination in misophonics, according to Kumar et al.’s \nstructural analysis of brain data (DMN) [11]. This anatomi-\ncal discrepancy may explain the aberrant functional connec-\ntion of AIC to DMN in misophonics compared to controls. \nOverall, Kumar et al. findings.'s indicate aberrant AIC activ -\nity and functional connectivity, suggesting potential areas \nand systems that could represent the neurological process \nunderlying misophonia [ 11]. Ultimately, these discover -\nies may be clinically significant, since they give important \ninformation about potential biological systems that might \nbe changed when creating treatment plans for people with \nmisophonia.\nFurther evidence of the misophonia's neurophysiologi-\ncal basis has been given by Schroder et al. [ 23]. Schroder \nand colleagues studied the N1 component of the late evoked \nauditory potentials. They reported reduced amplitude of the \nN1 component in the oddball stimuli, the marker linked to \nearly attention and detection of abrupt sensory changes. \nTheir findings showed a neurobiological deficit in individu-\nals with misophonia, which could impair auditory processing \nof the incoming stimuli, although there is no direct causal \nlink. Similarly, Schroder et al. used mismatch negativity \nresponse as the objective test of central auditory processing \nand reported reduced MMN response in individuals with \nmisophonia compared to the control group [29].\nEdelstein et al. conducted the first study to examine mis-\nophonia utilizing psychophysiological testing [20]. They \nmeasure the sympathetic nervous system response utilizing \nunisensory and multisensory stimuli in people with miso-\nphonia and control subjects using the skin conductance \nresponse (SCR). When compared to controls, misophonia \npatients responded more strongly to auditory-only stimuli in \nSCR data, but there was no discernible difference for visual-\nonly stimuli. The average level of aversiveness and mean \nSCR across all participants and the unisensory and multisen-\nsory trials were positively correlated.  Similarly, Kumar et al. \nreported triggers eliciting increased heart rate and galvanic \nskin response in individuals with misophonia compared to the control group [11]. From these findings, we can report \nthat misophonic responses can be measured in the autonomic \nnervous system. However, there are several limitations in the \nstudy by Edelstein et al. [ 20]. The few limitations to be noted \nare lack of adequate sample size, lack of clinical comparison \ngroup, and lack of proper screening measures for psychiatric \nand psychological measures [20]. There is a need to carry \nout research in the future using this method by improving \nthese limitations.\nIn the study by Brett-Green et al., early evoked response \npotentials (ERP) have been documented in the sensory \ncortex suggesting abnormal information processing in sen-\nsory over-responsive children [30]. Similarly, the study by \nSchröder et al. also supports the previous findings report-\ning a reduction in the mean amplitude of the N1 peak in \nindividuals with misophonic and reported impaired sensory \ngating in individuals with misophonia [23]. These results \nsuggest that atypical sensory processing might be present in \nadults and children with misophonia and sensory process-\ning disorders (SPD). The reduction in the amplitude of the \nN1 peak might be suggestive of sound encoding deficits in \nmisophonia. However, there is a need to carry out collabora -\ntive studies in the future with different field researchers to \ngain deep insight into the gating function in an individual \nwith misophonia.\nImplications of the study\nMisophonia is considered a psychological disorder. By sig-\nnifying various neurophysiological and neuroradiological \nfindings, the review confirms that misophonia is a neuro-\nphysiological disorder that may border between audiology, \nNeurology, and psychiatry. The review also highlights the \nneed to include neurophysiological and audiological meas-\nures for diagnosing misophonia, as only subjective measures \nfrom psychiatric perspectives are insufficient for properly \nassessing misophonia.\nAs misophonia is the topic of debate in the literature, this \nreview will help to confirm that misophonia is a real disorder \nas there are various neurophysiological alterations in the \nbrains of individuals with misophonia and also may show \nthe significance of including misophonia in the International \nClassification of Diseases (ICD) classification.\nThe present systematic review helped to understand the \ngap in the literature classification of misophonia. The pre-\nsent systematic review will shed light on understanding \nthe Neuroaudiological pathophysiology of misophonia and \nprovide the compiled information on the pathophysiology \nof misophonia. The findings of this review can be used fur -\nther in the assessment and management of misophonia from \naudiological and neurological perspectives.

In addition, this review’s findings \nhelp differentiate the pathophysiology of misophonia from \nother sound disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis and \nprovide the path for assessment and management strategies.\nLimitations of the study\nThe present review has a few limitations. Few articles \nincluded in the review have an inadequate sample size, \nwhich could have biased the results. Misophonia can occur \nin isolation or as a co-morbid condition. However, most \nstudies did not discuss co-morbidity and the exclusion of \nthe participants based on co-morbidities. Hence, the results \nobtained may also be due to co-morbidities. Although a sali-\nent concern, this review only included studies published in \nEnglish.Conclusions\nMisophonia is a new neurophysiological condition that \nis relatively less explored. The exact neurophysiology of \nmisophonia is not known yet, and this is still the topic of \ndebate between psychiatry, audiology, and neurology. The \nproper assessment and management of the individual with \nmisophonia are impossible without understanding the core \nmechanism behind it. Therefore, to gain detailed insight into \nthe neurophysiology of misophonia, we reviewed all the \nresearch articles about the physiology of misophonia pub-\nlished till 2021 using proper inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nThe primary purpose of our study was to see the brain \nbasis of an individual with misophonia highlighting more \nthe auditory neurophysiology. We reviewed 12 research \narticles that were related to the pathophysiology of miso-\nphonia. In summary, we found that the brain functioning of \nan individual with misophonia differs from that of a control \nsubject.
