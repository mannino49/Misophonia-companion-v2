Therefore,\nweinvestigated which indicators canbeused toidentify differences inbodily responses andperceptual assess-\nments ofeach individual when exposed tofour different sounds. First, based onanaudiometric test, thehearing\nacuity of15students (from fivedifferent profiles based ontheir acoustical preferences andneeds) wasmeasured.\nThen, twosound exposure experiments were conducted intheSenseLab: direct sound exposure using earbuds in\nalaboratory setting, andindirect sound exposure with speakers inarealroom setting. During each experiment,\ntheattention level (AL), mental relaxation level (MRL), heart rate(HR), andrespiration rate(RR) were measured\nwith wearable devices, andstudents made perceptual assessments ofeach condition. Thepercentage ofchange\nnormalised thefour bodily response measurements among students. Based oncorrelation analysis andt-tests,\nbodily responses, andperceptual assessments across experiments were compared, atgroup-level andindividual-\nlevel.

Theacoustical\nquality isoneoftheIEQfactors thatmay positively ornegatively affect\nstudents ’health andcomfort [6,7] .Background noise isoneoftheIEQ\nstressors that cancause nonauditory effects such asprolonged stress,caused indirectly bytheanti-stress mechanism that isactivated when\nexposed tostressors such asnoise [8,9] .Theanti-stress mechanism in-\ncreases adrenaline andnor-adrenaline levels intheshort-term, possibly\nleading toanincrease inheart rate(HR) andrespiration rate(RR) [9].\nChanges inphysical and/or physiological responses (including HR,RR\nandbrainwaves) asaresult ofexposure toaphysical stressor, such as\nnoise, arereferred toasbodily responses [10,11] .Thus, astudy of\noccupant-related indicators, including bodily responses andperceptual\nassessments, might contribute toabetter understanding oftheeffects of\ntheacoustical environment onstudents ’preferences andneeds [12].\nTheeffects ofsound asanenvironmental stressor have been studied\nAbbreviations: AL,attention level; HR,heart rate; IEQ, indoor environmental quality; MRL, mental relaxation level; RR,respiration rate; SPL, sound pressure level.\n*Correspondence to:Faculty ofArchitecture and theBuilt Environment, Delft University ofTechnology, Building 8,Julianalaan 134, Delft 2628BL, the\nNetherlands.\nE-mailaddress: a.b.hamida@tudelft.nl (A.Hamida).\nContents listsavailable atScienceDirect\nIndoor Environments\nu{�~zkw s{yo|kr o>ÐÐÐ1�mt ozmont~om�1m{ y2u{�~zk w2tzn{{~/oz�t ~{zyoz��\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.indenv.2024.100066\nReceived 4September 2024; Received inrevised form 11November 2024; Accepted 16November 2024INDENV  1 (2024)  100066  \nAvailable  online  21 November  2024  \n2950-3620/©  2024  The Author(s).

      "text": "using bodily responses and perceptual assessments. For instance,\nAlvarsson etal.[13] examined university students’ bodily responses,\nincluding high-frequency HRvariability, when exposed tonatural\nsounds andenvironmental noises. Their findings indicated nosignificant\nchanges inHRduring theexperiment; however, thestudents rated the\nnatural sounds asthemost pleasant. Abbasi etal.[14] investigated\nuniversity students’ bodily responses tothree sound pressure levels\n(SPL) oflow-frequency sound inalabexperiment. They recorded bodily\nresponses, including electroencephalogram (EEG) forbrain wave signals\nandelectrocardiography forHRsignals. They observed thatthese bodily\nresponses significantly differed among thedifferent SPLs, andstudents’\nmental fatigue increased when theSPLincreased. Tristan-Hernandez [7]\nfound thatboth beta andtheta brain wave amplitudes decreased when\nuniversity students were exposed tobackground noise, resulting in\nreduced attention levels while performing cognitive tasks. Furthermore,\nGuan etal.[15] concluded that brain wave patterns differed between\ntheperceived comfortable sound condition (music sound at50dB)and\ntheperceived uncomfortable sound condition (fannoise at80dB).They\nalsoobserved adecline intheta wave during theuncomfortable sound\ncondition. However, correlations between bodily responses and\nperceptual assessments ofbackground noise were nottested inthese\nstudies. Park andLee[16] measured both HR,andRRofparticipants\nand asked them toassess thenoticeability and annoyance ofthese\nsounds, while being exposed tosix-floor impact noise (e.g., adult\nwalking andchild running) stimuli. They found thatRRwascorrelated\nsignificantly and positively with both perceptual assessments ofthe\nstandard floor impact noise. Similarly, Hume and Ahtamad [17]\nconcluded thatRRincreased during themost perceived pleasant sound\nclips. Thus, HR, RR,and brain waves asbodily responses could be\nmeasured toexplain differences intheacoustical needs ofstudents.\nHuman ears aremost sensitive tohigh frequencies (3000–5000 Hz)\nandgenerally most annoyed bylow-frequency noise (20–125 Hz),which\ncancause stress [18,19] andnegatively impact cardiovascular responses\nsuch asHR[20]. Forinstance, Muetal.[21] observed thatHRslightly\nincreased among senior adults (over 60years old) with mild orsevere\nhearing loss upto55dB(A), butremained stable above that level.\nKeur-Huizinga etal.[22] studied theimpact ofhearing acuity onHRin\n125 participants aged 37–72, exposed tospeech sound stimuli (fre-\nquencies ranged from 330 to6300 Hz). They found noconsistent\nchanges inHRreactivity inparticipants with different hearing acuity,\nandconcluded thathearing acuity might beassociated with changes in\nthesympathetic nervous system’s reactivity. Mackersie etal.[23]\nexamined theeffects ofhearing lossandnoise onstress-related auto-\nnomic measures in33participants (18with hearing loss, 15with normal\nhearing, ages 22–79) during sentence recognition tasks. They found that\nthe HR ofparticipants with hearing loss decreased atlower\nsignal-to-noise ratios, while HRofthose with normal hearing didnot.\nThey highlighted that participants with hearing lossmay experience\nincreased effort andstress during speech recognition innoisy environ-\nments, which could influence thepsychophysiological responses con-\ncerning theautonomic nervous system.\nTheabove-mentioned studies [21–23] recruited senior adults, who\nhave alower sensitivity tolow-frequency sounds compared toyoung\nadults. Although Alimohammadi andEbrahimi [24] tested theuniver-\nsitystudents’ mental performance while being exposed toboth lowand\nhigh-frequency sounds, they excluded thestudents whose hearing\nthreshold was lessthan 20dB.Hence, little isknown about therela-\ntionship between hearing acuity inyoung adults andtheir bodily re-\nsponses todifferent sound types. Furthermore, while hearing acuity\nmeasured through anaudiometric testhasbeen considered inseveral\nsound exposure experiments with human subjects [13,14,18,25,26],\ndifferences inbodily responses concerning thehearing thresholds of\ndifferent students atvarious sound frequencies have notstudied.\nMost oftheabove-mentioned labexperiments [7,13–17] considered\nparticipants’ personal traits, including demographics (e.g., ageand\ngender) andhearing acuity ornoise sensitivity. However, they mainlyfocused ontheoverall bodily responses andperceptual assessment at\ngroup-level ignoring differences inpreferences andneeds between in-\ndividuals (profiles). Profiling occupants based ontheir preferences and\nneeds ofacertain indoor environment isoneofthemethods thattake\ninto account thedifferences between individuals’ intheindoor envi-\nronment [27]. Noting thatprofiling ofoccupants inseveral situations (e.\ng.,classrooms, study places, homes, andhospitals) hasbeen addressed in\nprevious studies [28–31]. Inconnection tothesound-related preferences\nofstudents, Hamida etal.[32] identified five profiles ofuniversity\nstudents based ontheir acoustical andpsychosocial preferences fortheir\nstudy places, such assounds from theoutside andprivacy. These five\nprofiles are: 1)sound concerned introvert, 2)sound unconcerned\nintrovert, 3)sound partially concerned introvert, 4)sound concerned\nextrovert, and5)sound unconcerned extrovert. Moreover, they identi-\nfiedaspects related tothepreferences ofeach profile through afield\nstudy, such asboth students from profiles 1,3,and4were concerned\nwith thesounds from theoutside because they gotannoyed andlost\nfocus bythese sounds. According tothese aspects, itwasconcluded that\nthestudy place’s context, such asbuilding location, might affect stu-\ndents’ acoustical preferences.\nStudies onbodily responses tobemeasured forstudents from\ndifferent profiles when exposed toboth preferable andnon-preferable\nsounds could notbefound intheliterature. Also, thehearing acuity at\ndifferent sound frequencies ofuniversity students wasnotwidely stud-\nied.Inaddition, toadvance knowledge inthisarea, studies oncorrela-\ntions between bodily responses (e.g., HR), health aspects (e.g., hearing\nacuity), environmental indicators (e.g., SPL and sound frequency),\nperceptual assessments (e.g., pleasantness), current situation ofstudy\nplaces (e.g., existing sound sources), andpreferences ofuniversity stu-\ndents from different profiles, areneeded. Furthermore, westillneed to\ntestwhich ofthebodily responses (including HR,RR,andbrain waves\nthat were tested inprevious studies) canbemeasured toexplain dif-\nferences intheacoustical preferences ofdifferent students. Hence, the\nmain aimofthisstudy istopropose guidance forinvestigating thebodily\nresponses that canhelp usbetter understand thedifferences ineach\nstudent’s perceptual responses todifferent sounds. Therefore, themain\nresearch question ofthis study is:Can bodily responses beused to\nexplain differences inpreferences and/or needs fordifferent sounds, and\nhow canwetestthis?\n2.Methods\n2.1.Studydesign\nTostudy which indicators canbeused toidentify differences in\nbodily responses todifferent sounds and sound levels, two sound\nexposure labexperiments were conducted onfour days inNovember\n2023 with fourstudents perday(except foronedaywith three students).\nAllofthese experiments took place intheSenseLab [33]. These two\nsound exposure labexperiments aimtoanswer thefour sub-questions\nthatanswer themain research question ofthisstudy, which are:\n1.Towhat extent isanaudiometric testessential forsound exposure lab\nexperiments?\n2.Canstudents’ perceptual assessments ofsound conditions substan-\ntiate their acoustical preferences from thefield study?\n3.Dobodily responses correlate with perceptual assessments of\ndifferent sounds?\n4.Dobodily responses and perceptual assessments differ signifi-\ncantly when students areexposed directly orindirectly tosounds?\nAnaudiometric testwasperformed totestthehearing acuity ofthe\nparticipating students.

Thus, the‘direct ’sound exposure\nexperiment ismainly focused onthedirect effect ofthesound condition\nonboth bodily responses andperceptual assessment. Incontrast, the\nsounds inthe‘indirect ’sound exposure experiment were produced bya\nsound-producing system (four speakers) intheceiling thatpropagated in\ntheExperience room with thepresence ofother ‘sound ’stressors, such as\nthepresence ofother students. This study aims tocompare whether the\nbodily responses andperceptual assessments ofdifferent sounds differ\nsignificantly between thedirect andindirect sound exposures. Inboth\nexperiments, theother factors (lighting, indoor air,andthermal condi-\ntions) were kept asconstant aspossible.\n2.2.Participants\nParticipants comprised bachelor andmaster students (n15inthe\ntestchamber with power level 1-β0.6,andn14intheExperience\nroom with power level 1-β0.6,where βrefers tobeta which istype II\nerror), from thefaculty ofArchitecture andtheBuilt Environment at\nDelft University ofTechnology, intheNetherlands.

Students were asked nottoperform any\nphysical exercise before theexperiment orsmoke ordrink coffee, as\nthese activities might affect their bodily responses. Seven were female\nstudents andeight were male students. Their mean agewas21years\n(standard deviation: 1.5). These students allparticipated inaprevious\nquestionnaire andfield study performed byHamida etal.[32].That\nstudy resulted infive profiles based onacoustical and psychosocial\npreferences oftheir study places gathered through aquestionnaire. In\nFig.1theacoustical andpsychosocial preferences ofthese fiveprofiles\narepresented. Two students perprofile (asaminimum) participated in\nthelabexperiments: two students from Profile 1,two students from\nProfile 2,three students from Profile 3,fourstudents from Profile 4,and\nfour students from Profile 5.Additionally, tobetter explain both the\nbodily responses andtheperceptual assessments ofeach student, partof\ndata gathered inthat previous study [32] wasused, including soundsources andbuilding-related indicators (seeAppendix A).\n2.3.Bodilyresponses\nTwo wearable sensors, anEEG headband (brain activity) and a\nsmartwatch (Fig.2),were used tomeasure four bodily responses: 1)\nattention level (AL); 2)mental relaxation level (MRL); 3)heart rate\n(HR); and4)respiration rate(RR). Both HRandRRwere chosen because\noftheir possible relation with theanti-stress mechanism andtheir ease\nofmeasurement with smartwatches. ALwasassessed todetermine how\ncertain sounds affect astudent ’sattention, while MRL wasmeasured to\nevaluate theeffects ofdifferent sounds onastudent ’smental stress (also\npossibly related totheanti-stress mechanism).\nTheBrainLink LiteEEG headband byMacrotellect measured ALand\nMRL using three dryelectrodes attached totheparticipant ’sforehead.\nEEG data were processed bytheTGAM chipset from NeuroSky [35] and\ntransmitted inreal-time toacomputer viaBluetooth every half-second\nusing Python code inPyCharm 2023. Thedata were saved asaCSV\nfile,including attention levels, MRLs, andvarious brain waves (Delta,\nTheta, Low-Alpha, High-Alpha, Low-Beta, High-Beta, Low-Gamma, and\nMid-Gamma). Both attention andMRL were measured onascale from\n0to100.\nThe Garmin Vivosmart 5smartwatch monitored HRand RRper\nminute, known toshow good accuracy during low-intensity activity\n[36].Since theabsolute relative error ofthesmartwatch showed alower\nerror ontheleftwrist compared totheright wrist during aroutine ac-\ntivity ofdaily living [36],students were asked towear thesmartwatch\nontheir leftwrist during theexperiment. Afterward, thesmartwatch was\nconnected toacomputer viaUSB totransfer data using Garmin Express\nsoftware, and the data were manually transferred toanExcel\nspreadsheet.\nThe audiometric test (Fig. 3)was conducted inone ofthetest\nchambers oftheSenseLab using aclinical audiometer (Otometrics\nMADSEN Xeta) toanswer thefirst sub-question. Amonaural audio-\nmetric testwith theairconduction method wasconducted byproducing\nasound indifferent SPLs (starting from 0dB)atdifferent sound pressure\nlevels (starting from 0dB)across eight frequencies: 125, 250, 500, 1000,\n2000, 4000, 6000, and8000 Hz.Thestudent satinfront oftheexam-\niner, holding aresponse stick, andclicked theresponse button upon\nhearing asound ateach frequency.

Two clips represented outdoor sounds andtworepresented\nindoor sounds, covering different frequencies, were downloaded from\ntheonline database ‘Freesound ’[49]:1)aquiet rural area recorded in\ntheNetherlands (covers low-frequency ranges), 2)acitycenter with\nhigh traffic recorded intheNetherlands (covers most frequency ranges),\n3)mechanical ventilation (covers lowfrequencies), and4)people talk-\ninginDutch (covers moderate frequency ranges); andcompiled intoone\nfileusing Audacity 3.3.3 software [50].These four sound clips were\nrecorded monoaurally. Thequiet rural area andthecitycentre area clips\nwere recorded outdoors while themechanical ventilation andthepeople\ntalking clips were recorded indoors. Thesound signal spectra ofthefour\nsound clips areillustrated inFig.6.\nInthetest chambers, thesounds were played through noise-\ncanceling JBLLive Pro2earbuds. These were used because they are\nlight ontheparticipant ’shead since they wearing theBrainLink LiteEEG\ndevice. Also, other researchers, such asGuo etal.[51],indicated that\nearbuds aretruewireless stereo devices thatcanbeconnected throughBluetooth toahardware device, such asacomputer, andcanprovide\nconsistent output SPLs when they receive digital audio. IntheExperi-\nence room asexplained byBluyssen etal.[33],they were played\nthrough four ceiling-mounted speakers ‘near-midfield studio monitors,\nthree-way, 2*7″woofer, ADAM Audio A77x ’and‘asubwoofer 200W,\n1*10 ″MKII, ADAM Audio Sub10 ’from AMPTEC which areconnected to\naBehringer UMC404HD audio interface. Each sound clipwasplayed at\ntwodifferent sound pressure levels (SPLs): lowandhigh (Table 1).The\nSPLs fortheearbuds were measured using acalibrated KEMAR dummy\nhead with twoBruel&Kjaer microphones. IntheExperience room, the\nSPLs were determined byusing aNorsonic Nor140sound level meter\nandensuring thattheSPLdidnotexceed 100dB(A).\n2.8.Procedure\n2.8.1.Testchambers experiment\nThefirstexperiment wasdivided intotwoparts, each with aduration\nof14minutes (Fig.7).Thefirst part focused onthesounds from the\noutside while thesecond part focused onthesounds from theinside.\nTwo students participated simultaneously inthisexperiment, each in\noneofthetestchambers. Theresearcher gave anintroduction tothe\nstudents outside thetestchambers andexplained tothem theprocedure\nwithout informing thestudents about thesound sources. Aresearcher\nhanded each ofthestudents themeasurement devices andthepairs of\nearbuds. Then each student entered thetestchamber, wasseated, and\nafter twominutes heard thesentence ‘this isthestart oftheexperiment ’\nupon which thestudent started theexperiment bypressing thestart\nbutton onthetimer totrack theexperiment timeline.

According totheWHO test[37],allstudents hadnormal hearing in\nboth ears, except fortwo(students 1and6)who suffered from mild\nhearing loss. Additionally, several students suffered from mild hearing\nlossinlowfrequencies (between 125and250Hz).More specifically, the\nhearing threshold ofstudents 3,4,6,10,11,and13of125Hzwas\nhigher than 25dB,meaning thatthey have mild hearing lossatthatlow\nfrequency sound. However, most ofthem could hear thehighest fre-\nquency (8000 Hz)inthelowSPLwith atleast oneoftheir ears.\n3.2.Bodilyresponses\n3.2.1.Bodilyresponses inthetestchambers\nThe averaged responses ofthe15students tothefour indicators\nduring theeight sound conditions oftheexperiments inthetestcham-\nbersarepresented inFig.10.Ingeneral, these fourindicators fluctuated\nduring thedifferent sound conditions.

Four main findings arediscussed below: the\naudiometric test, theperceptual assessments ofthedifferent profiles,\ncorrelations between bodily responses andperceptual assessments, and\ndirect andindirect sound exposure.\n4.1.1.Theaudiometric test\nSixstudents (3,4,6,10,11,and13)suffered from mild hearing loss\ninlow-frequency sounds (Fig.8).Interestingly, these students belong to\ntheprofiles who aresound partially concerned orsound unconcerned\n(students 3and4aresound unconcerned introverts, student 6isasound\npartially concerned introvert, andstudents 10,11,and13aresoundunconcerned extroverts). Moreover, student 6’sHRincreased themost\nwhile being exposed tothelow-frequency sound stimuli: the‘low rural ’\ncondition inthetestchamber ’sexperiment butfound itmost acceptable.\nSimilarly, student 13,hadthehighest HRincrease inthesame condition\nintheExperience room ’sexperiment butperceived itasslightly noisy\nandacceptable. These observations could mean that even though the\nstudent could nothear thesound source atacertain SPL, thebody\nresponded physiologically. Mackersie etal.[23] highlighted that par-\nticipants with hearing lossmay experience increased effort andstress\nduring speech recognition innoisy environments, which could influence\nthepsychophysiological responses concerning theautonomic nervous\nsystem. This might explain theincreased HRinstudents 6and13,who\nlikely expected tohear asound during the‘low rural ’condition butdid\nnot,leading tostress andariseinHR.Therefore, hearing acuity seems\nanessential indicator toconsider insound exposure experiments that\ncould explain aperson ’sacoustical preferences andneeds.\nFig.14.Average perceptual assessments ofthegroup during theeight conditions inthetestchambers.\nFig.15.Perceptual assessments perstudent inthetestchambers.A.Hamida etal.

Forexample, inthetestchamber\n(asillustrated inFig.15),sixstudents (1,3,5,6,13,and14)deemed the\n‘high traffic ’condition asunacceptable, noting that four ofthese stu-\ndents arefrom profiles 1,3,and4who aresound concerned. Interms of\npleasantness, students 2,8,and12(from profiles 1and4)perceived the\n‘high rural ’condition asunpleasant, confirming thatthese students are\nsound concerned. Conversely, fivestudents (7,10,11,12,and15)found\nthe‘high traffic ’condition aspleasant. Interestingly, these students are\nexposed totraffic sounds attheir home study place (Appendix A),which\nmight result inthehabituation ofthissound type. Another example,\nconcerning stress levels, sixstudents (4,7,8,10,13,and15)perceivedthe‘high talking people ’condition asnotstressful, ofwhich fourofthem\nbelong totheextrovert profiles: 4and5.Pertaining totheperceptual\nassessments intheExperience room (Fig.17),both students 1and2who\nbelong tothe‘sound extremely concerned introvert ’profile perceived\nthe‘high rural ’condition asunacceptable, which confirms that these\ntwo students areextremely sound concerned.

Attheindividual-level, only twostudents\n(students 6and12)displayed astrong andpositive correlation between\ntheir MRL andacceptability. Additionally, student 6’sMRL wasstrongly,\npositively, andsignificantly correlated with pleasantness. Conversely,\nstudent 4’sMRL wasstrongly andsignificantly, butnegatively, corre-\nlated with theperceptual stress level. Since MRL isnotsignificantly\ncorrelated with perceptual assessments, itcould beused asaninde-\npendent bodily response alongside theother three bodily responses\nwhich didnotshow strong norsignificant correlations, separate from\nperceptual assessments.\nIntheExperience room experiment, ALwasstrongly, positively, and\nsignificantly correlated with both acceptability and noise levels at\ngroup-level. Itimplies thatwhen thesound condition wasperceived as\n‘acceptable ’and‘nonoise ’,ALincreased, andviceversa. Similarly, for\nindividual students 6and7,ALshowed strong, positive, andsignificant\ncorrelations with acceptability perceptual assessments. Furthermore,\nstudent 8’sALwasstrongly, positively, andsignificantly correlated with\ntheperceived noise level. Additionally, HRwasstrongly, negatively, and\nsignificantly correlated with noise levels during theExperience room\nexperiment atgroup-level: HRincreased asthenoise level wasperceived\nasloud ofwhich SPLwassetatahigh level. This finding aligns with\nLorenzino etal.[52],whoconcluded thatnoise levels ranging from 30to\n55dB(A) significantly impacted acoustical comfort, with higher noise\nlevels correlating with increased HRandpsychological discomfort. It\nalso corroborates Abbasi etal.[14],who found that HRsignificantly\ndiffered among various sound levels oflow-frequency noise. Moreover,\nLatini etal.found astrong association between pulse rateandsound-\nscape response ofwhich thepulse rate decreased with perceived\npleasant sounds andincreased with perceived unpleasant sounds [53].\nThus, HRisasignificant bodily response indicator associated with the\nnoise level andsound type (i.e., soundscape).\nInsummary, thefour bodily responses aregenerally independent of\ntheperceptual assessments. This indicates that perceptual assessmentscannot bereliably predicted from bodily responses, norcanbodily re-\nsponses bepredicted from perceptual assessments. This also confirms\nthestudy byErfanian etal.[54] thatsoundscape studies should consider\nboth bodily responses andperceptual assessments (i.e., psychological) to\nunderstand better how and why individuals experience thesound\nenvironment insuch way. However, ourstudy shows that HRisan\nexception, asitcanexplain theperceptual assessment related tothe\nperception ofthenoise level corresponding totheSPLasaphysical in-\ndicator. Inaddition, ALisanexception thatcould explain both accept-\nability andnoise level.\n4.1.4.Directsoundexposure vsindirect soundexposure\nThe present study compared bodily responses and perceptual\nassessment between twoexperimental settings: direct sound exposure\n(laboratory setting inthetestchambers) andindirect sound exposure\n(semi-real lifesetting intheExperience room). Atgroup-level, themean\nALamong theeight conditions varied significantly between thetwo\nexperiments, particularly under the‘low traffic ’,‘high traffic ’,and‘low\ntalking people ’conditions. These significant changes were alsoobserved\natindividual-level forseven students. Conversely, theacceptability as-\nsessments didnotshow significant differences between thetwoexperi-\nments. Given the significant differences inALbetween the two\nexperiments atboth group andindividual levels (among seven students),\nitappears thatthisbodily response might beaffected bythedifferences\nintheexperimental setup between thetwoexperiments. Additionally,\nMRL differed significantly between thetwoexperiments among three\nstudents anddiffered inthefirst condition ‘low rural ’atgroup level,\nwhich showed decreases inthesecond experiment. These differences\nmight belinked totheexperimental procedure. Itcanbealsonoted that\nthesound exposure time forboth experiments lasted twominutes per\ncondition. Thus, both ALandMRL could bemore reliable bodily re-\nsponses forlonger sound exposure durations, such as5[14,51] or\n10min[7].Furthermore, these twobodily responses could bemeasured\ninsound exposure experiments thatinvolve performance tasks, such as\ntesting mental fatigue [14] orattention based onacognitive task [7],\nwhich could explain differences inperformances. Both HRand RR\nshowed nosignificant differences between thetwoexperiments atgroup\nlevel. However, HRdidshow significant differences under ‘low venti-\nlation ’and ‘high ventilation ’conditions with agreater decrease\nobserved inthefirstexperiment. This difference may berelated tothe\nfactthatthestudent moved between chambers prior tothese twocon-\nditions. Also, significant HRdifferences were only observed intwoin-\ndividual students. Moreover, HRwassignificantly correlated with the\nnoise level. Therefore, HRandRRseem applicable forexplaining dif-\nferences inacoustical preferences andneeds within short-term sound\nexposure experiments. These twobodily responses canbemeasured in\nreal-life situations, such asastudy place, since nodifferences were\nobserved between thetwoexperiments aswell asthey were normally\ndistributed among students inboth experiments.\n4.2.Strengths andlimitations\nThis study represents afirst attempt toinvestigate university stu-\ndents ’bodily responses andperceptual assessments, accounting fortheir\nvarying acoustical and psychosocial preferences and needs, across\nmultiple levels: group, individual, andprofile levels. Through labex-\nperiments, itenhanced theunderstanding ofstudents ’acoustical pref-\nerences, previously classified into fiveprofiles [32].Another notable\nstrength ofthisstudy istheaudiometric testconducted with 15students,\ninwhich hearing thresholds atdifferent frequencies (forboth ears) were\nexamined, based ontheWHO guidelines [37].Additionally inthisstudy,\nbodily responses and perceptual assessments intwo distinct settings\nwere compared: alaboratory setting intestchambers andasemi-real life\nsetting intheExperience room.\nDespite thenovel contributions ofthisstudy, ithassome limitations.\nFirst, thesample sizeisrelatively small, comprising 15students (power:Table4\nCorrelations between bodily responses andperceptual assessments inthetest\nchambers atgroup-level.\nBodilyresponses vsperceptual assessments R P-value\nALvsAcceptability \u00000.2 0.69\nALvsPleasantness \u00000.1 0.74\nALvsStress level 0.2 0.65\nMRL vsAcceptability 0.7 0.06\nMRL vsPleasantness 0.6 0.14\nMRL vsStress level 0.6 0.10\nHRvsAcceptability 0.0 0.91\nHRvsPleasantness 0.3 0.49\nHRvsStress level \u00000.1 0.87\nRRvsAcceptability 0.2 0.57\nRRvsPleasantness 0.3 0.42\nRRvsStress level 0.1 0.74\nTable5\nCorrelations between bodily responses and perceptual assessments inthe\nExperience room atgroup-level.\nBodilyresponses vsperceptual assessments R P-value\nALvsAcceptability 0.6 0.03\nALvsNoise level 0.8 P<0.001\nMRL vsAcceptability \u00000.4 0.22\nMRL vsNoise level \u00000.2 0.57\nHRvsAcceptability •0.5 0.10\nHRvsNoise level •0.6 0.04\nRRvsAcceptability \u00000.4 0.25\nRRvsNoise level 0.0 0.89\nThe correlations between thefour bodily responses indicators and thetwo\nperceptual assessments differed among the14students (seeAppendix F).A.Hamida etal.

Finally, thebodily responses data were calculated as\nmean values forthetwo-minute exposure time rather than thereal-time\nmeasurements persecond duetothelimitations oftheGarmin smart-\nwatch thatexports theHRandRRdata pertwo-minutes.\n4.3.Implications andfutureresearch\nTheinterpretation ofthekeyfindings ofthisstudy (asdetailed in\nSection 4.1)provides insights forfuture researchers inthedesign and\nset-up ofsound exposure experiments aimed atinvestigating partici-\npants ’bodily responses toandperceptual assessments ofsounds.\nFirst, theaudiometric testisacritical procedure with thepotential to\nelucidate participants ’bodily responses and perceptual assessments\nwhen exposed tospecific sound types. Second, profiling participants (e.\ng.,students) based ontheir acoustical preferences could provide aclear\nunderstanding oftheir perceptual assessments ofdifferent sounds.\nThird, HRandRRarereliable androbust indicators ofbodily responses\nthat can beeffectively measured using simple wearable devices,\ndemonstrating clear reactions toshort-term sound exposure. Lastly,\ngiven thelack ofstrong orsignificant correlations between bodily re-\nsponses andperceptual assessments, itisimperative toconsider both\nindependently insound exposure research.\nBecause ofthesample sizelimitations asthisisafollow-up study ofa\nspecific pool ofstudents, itisrecommended forfuture research torecruit\natleast 26students perprofile (ofwhich thepower level is1-β0.8,as\nindicated byPark etal.[48]).This could better present theresults per\nprofile rather than perindividual, such asperforming thecorrelations\nbetween thebodily responses andperceptual assessments perprofile and\ntesting whether theprofile isasignificant variable. Furthermore, itis\nrecommended forfuture sound exposure experiments torandomise the\nsound conditions toacquire comprehensive results inexplaining how\nbodily responses canbeused toexplain differences insound perceptions\nandpreferences. Given thefactthattheHRandRRshowed nosignifi-\ncant differences between thetwoexperiments, itisencouraged toalso\nmeasure them inareal-life situation, such asarealstudy place.\n5.Conclusion\nThis study conducted two sound exposure experiments with 15\nuniversity students from five profiles who differ intheir acoustical\npreferences oftheir study places. Each experiment included four bodily\nresponses (AL, MRL, HR, and RR) and five perceptual assessments\n(acceptability, pleasantness, stress level, andnoise level), while students\nwere exposed tofoursound types varying infrequencies andSPLs intwodifferent settings. Thekeyfindings aresummarised asfollows:\n1.Therelationship between hearing acuity andbodily responses (such\nasHR) andsound perception seems tobeessential forbetter un-\nderstanding how ourbody responds tosound. Itwasobserved that\nalthough students suffered from mild hearing lossinlowfrequency,\ntheir bodies physiologically responded when they were exposed toa\nlow-frequency sound condition.\n2.Theoutcomes from thisstudy showed thattheperceptual assessment\ninalabexperiment setting confirmed theacoustical preferences of\nthefiveprofiles ofuniversity students.\n3.This study found thatboth HRandRRwere notstrongly norsignif-\nicantly correlated with perceptual assessments during direct sound\nexposure inthetestchamber. HRwas strongly and significantly\nrelated totheperceptual assessment ofnoise level intheExperience\nroom.\n4.Both HRandRRshowed nosignificant differences between thetwo\nexperiments ofthisstudy. This implies that they arereliable for\nexplaining acoustical preferences andcanbemeasured inrealen-\nvironments aswellsince they showed nodifferences between thetwo\nsettings: alaboratory setting intestchambers andasemi-real life\nroom setting intheExperience room. Incontrast, ALandMRL were\naffected bytheexperimental setting andprocedure inthisstudy,\nwhich could bemore reliable foralonger sound exploration ofex-\nperiments and/or involve performance tasks.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nPhilomena M.Bluyssen: Writing –review &editing, Supervision,\nMethodology, Conceptualization.
