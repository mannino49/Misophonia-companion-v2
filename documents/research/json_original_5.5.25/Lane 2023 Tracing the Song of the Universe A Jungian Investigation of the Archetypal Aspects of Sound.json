Lane  \nThis hermeneutic study investigates the psychological impact and meaning of sound \nand considers what it may reveal about our relationship to the nature of reality. \nSound ’s influence on the psyche and its recurring characteristics are relatively \nunexplored in depth psychology. The new sciences, musicology, and cosmology help \nus better understand sound ’s role in personal and colle ctive psychology, as understood \nby Swiss analytical psychologist C.G. Jung. Several perspectives are explored. A \nJungian view of misophonia (reactions to unwanted sounds or noise) has the potential \nto expand our understanding of the role of the instincts i n relation to sound and its \nnegative influences within the psyche. Music preferences and aesthetics point to \narchetypal aspects of sound frequency as it relates to the collective unconscious and \ninstincts. Cymatics (the science of vibrational phenomena) su ggests sound has \npotential to create geometric shapes similar to mandala formations. It is argued, \nconsequently, that these formations suggest a secret language or underlying order of \nthe universe, implying that sound has an archetypal basis. This supposit ion is \nsupported by exploring alternative scientific theories of the nature of reality within the \nnew sciences, such as physicist David Bohm ’s concept of the holomovement morphic"

      "text": "ARCHETYPAL SOUND  \n  \nChapter  1  \nIntroduction  \nIntroduction to the Research  Area  \nUnderstanding the significance of music and its impact on the psyche is a topic that has \nbeen explored since at least the dawn of ancient Greece. For example, some ancient Greek \nphilosophers displayed an appreciation for specific notes and instruments as i nfluential on the \nbody and mind. Psychiatrist and professor Assad Meymandi (2009) recounted how “Aristotle \n(323–373 BCE), in his renowned book De Anima , wrote that ‘flute music could arouse strong \nemotions and purify the soul ’” (p. 43). The sounds in music , from a scientific perspective, are \n“transmitted vibrations of any frequency, ” and these frequencies range from “20 to 20,000 Hz, \ncapable of being detected by human organs of hearing ” (McKusick , 2014, p. 33). In other words, \nour ears detect these waves as  they impact the eardrum and vibrate into our brains, sending \nsignals that cause associations and impulses. What can be said of ancient Greece and other \nancient cultures is that whether it was the use of specific instruments or sonic tones, sound has \nhad a  profound, reoccurring impact on human civilization —and humans have sought to \nunderstand it from scientific, philosophical, and metaphysical perspectives. I will investigate in \nmy study the possibility of sound having meaning beyond just the cause and effe ct of frequencies \nimpacting the eardrum. In my research , I will explore the instinctual and emotive relationship \nbetween sound and the body and what it might reveal.  \nWhat Is Archetypal Sound ? \nOur relationship to sound extends beyond just music, which is wh y I suggest it is \nessential to explore sound from other perspectives, particularly through a depth psychological —\npredominantly  Jungian —lens.

Ellenberger (1970) noted that \ndepth psychology primarily originates with Sigmund Freud and “can be understood as the \ncombined findings from Freud ’s self-analysis  and the analysis of his patients ” (p. 490). One \npioneer o f depth psychology and founder of analytical psychology, Swiss psychiatrist Carl \nGustav Jung, speculated that there is a unified field of reality that encompasses everything. \nAccording to Jung, this underlying reality contains both psyche and matter, and h e referred to it \nas the unus mundus —the alchemical term meaning “one world. ”  \nFor Jung (1954/1969 a), the psyche encompasses the entirety of one ’s psychological \nexperience; it includes both conscious and unconscious aspects of an individual. However, more \ncomplicated is the notion that the psyche is perhaps beyond just the dimensions of the mind; \nrather, it spills out into one ’s external life and objective reality. Jung described the unconscious \nas: \nA deeper layer, which does not derive from personal experie nce and is not a personal \nacquisition but is inborn. This deeper layer I call the collective unconscious. I have \nchosen the term “collective ” because this part of the unconscious is not individual but \nuniversal; in contrast to the personal psyche, it has c ontents and modes of behaviour that \nare more or less the same everywhere and in all individuals. It is, in other words, identical \nin all men and thus constitutes a common psychic substrate of a suprapersonal nature \nwhich is present in every one of us.

      "text": "ARCHETYPAL ASPECTS OF SOUND  \n 3 \nConsidering this quote, I will examine how sound might contain unknown elements that could \nreveal more about the relationship between psyche and matter within the unus mundus. Jung \n(1955 –56/1970) argued:   \nUndoubtedly the idea of the unus mundus  is founded on the assumption that the \nmultiplicity of the empirical world rests on an underlying unity, and that not two or more \nfundamentally different worlds exist side by side or are mingled with one another. \nRather, everything d ivided and different belongs to one and the same world, which is not \nthe world of sense. (p. 344)  \nWhat makes sound significant for research is that it grounds how we relate to our surroundings, \nand it is the very source of the vibrations that influence our reality.  \nAuthor and professor Vern O. Knudsen (1948), in Sound Waves and Rhythms , highlights \nthe importance of sound as a valid subject for investigation. He wrote:  \nThe rhythmical patterns of sound waves in air —music, speech, and noise —surrou nd us \neternally, and we hear them from the cradle to the grave. Sometimes these rhythmical \nwaves flow gently and sweetly over us, and gladden our hearts; sometimes they impinge \nharshly on our ears, and disturb our sleep or raise our blood pressure. Most of  what we \nlearn and much of what we enjoy are conveyed to us on waves of sound. It is natural, \ntherefore, that man should be curious about these waves and rhythms, as indeed \ninquisitive man always has been. (Knudsen, 1948, p. 430)  \nIn this study, I will inve stigate sound through a Jungian perspective, exploring sound ’s \npotential ly deeper importance within the unus mundus, examining its psychological influences \nand what it tells us about the nature of the psyche on a personal and collective level."

      "text": "ARCHETYPAL ASPECTS OF SOUND  \n 4 \n  An importa nt aspect of my study concerns the notion of the archetype , which I will \ndescribe in further detail later on. The archetypes, according to Jung (1952/1969), are essentially \n“formal factors responsible for the organization of unconscious psychic processes: they are \n‘patterns of behaviour ’” (p. 436 [CW 8, para. 841]). The manifestation of these archetypal \nforces, which dwell in the unconscious, often appears as our instincts and reactions:   \nPsychic existence can be recognized only by the presence of contents  that are capable of \nconsciousness. We can therefore speak of an unconscious only in so far as we are able to \ndemonstrate its contents. The contents of the personal unconscious are chiefly the \nfeeling -toned complexes, as they are called; they constitute th e personal and private side \nof psychic life. The contents of the collective unconscious, on the other hand, are known \nas archetypes. (Jung, 1954/1969 a, p. 4 [CW 9i, para. 4])    \nArchetypes are potentially observable throughout the fabric of all existence an d studying them \nmight help us better understand our reality. In depth psychology, a psychology that recognizes \nthe existence of an unconscious  dimension of the  psyche , understanding the meaning of \narchetype is important as it helps us to understand these reoccurring patterns in the psyche. I \npropose that investigating sound from an archetypal perspective might reveal more about sonic \nfrequencies than what has been commonly known or assumed.    \nResearcher ’s Relationship to the Topic  \n I have  always  been extraordinarily  sensitive  to sound.  As a young  girl, I remember  lying  \nin my bed at night  hearing  my parents ’ voices  across  the hall. With  both doors  closed,  I could  \nstill hear them  as clear  as day, their “s” sounds  penetrating  my ears, creating  a surging  rage in my \nbody,  causing  great  suffering  and sensory  overload.  I remember  having  to fight  the anger  these  \nsounds  caused  me, finally  succumbing  to getting  out of my bed to confront  my parents,  asking  if"

Whenever  I sleep  next to someone,  and \nthat fateful  moment  comes  when  they fall asleep  before  me, the light to heavy  breathing  begins,  \nand it is all I can focus  on. Or worse,  the dreaded  snoring  begins,  and as I fight  back the tears,  \nstaring  at the innocent  and unassuming  person  next to me, I become  powerless  over sound.  I \noften  find myself  creeping  into the next room  to claim  the last few hours  of sleep  before  the sun \ncomes  up.  \n I usually  have a rain track  downloaded  on my phone , ready  to be played  if I must  sleep  at \nsomeone ’s house  or forget  my earplugs.  In my home,  I keep a white  noise  machine  on \nthroughout  most  of the day. I use sound  to fight  sound.  This relationship  with sound  has been  \nwith me for most  of my life, but I am not alone  in my struggle.  This phenomenon  is often  caused  \nby a condition  called  misophonia , defined  as the hatred  of sound.  According  to behaviorist  \nThomas  Dozier  (2017):  \nMisophonia  is a condition  where  a person  has an extreme  emotional  response  to \ncommonly  occurring  soft sounds  or visual  images.  These  are called  “triggers ” because  \nthey trigger  the emotional  response  of anger  and disgust.  The anger  may be any form  \nsuch as irritation,  anger,  hatred,  or rage.  (p. 2)  \nI have  been living  with this condition  for as long as I can remember,  making  life more  \nchallenging  to navigate  because  of my relationship  with sound.  \n However,  I have another  relationship  with sound  that has been  renewing,  creative,  and \neven  healing.  I have  been  a musician  for most  of my adult  life, touring  the country,  playing  \nshows,  and releasing  albums.  Through  these  years,  sound  has liberated  my soul,  allowing  me to \nexpress  parts  of my creative  side that could  only be achieved  through  song.

My experience  with these  frequencies  has soothed  and \nhelped  me regain  control  of my emotions  when  I felt caught  in a chaotic  state.   \nAs I continue  to pursue  my investigations  of sound,  I am finding  it leading  me into a \nlabyrinth,  where  I must  embrace  this journey  as I come  to understand  what  might  be considered  \nthe archetypa l meaning  behind  sound.  In recent  years,  a popular  therapy  has emerged  using  \nsound  frequencies  in the healing  arts through  small , handheld  metal  devices  called  tuning  forks.  \nIn her work,  Tuning  the Human  Biofield:  Healing  with Vibrational  Sound  Therapy,  author and \nsound  therapist  Eileen  Day McKusick  (2014)  proposed  that when  considering  the impact  of \nsound  on matter,  it comes  down  to understanding  energy  in its pure form  (p. 15). Sound  \nfrequencies  are the expression  of “subtle  energy, ” an energy  that exists  in every  living  thing  (p. \n15). In weighing  this idea,  I propose  that appreciating  how sound  manifests  can extend  our \narchetypal  knowing  and and how that knowing  might  operate  in an energetic  field theory.  In \nMcKusick ’s (2014)  work , the use of tuning  forks  is: \nLike sonar —as they are combed  or passed  through  the field,  their changing  overtones  \nreflect  changes  in the terrain  of the biofield.  Blockages  of flow and distortions  in the field \nshow  up as a dissonance  that is readily  perceived  by both the therapist  and client.  In this \nway,  they are used diagnostically.  However,  the coherent  frequency  of the forks  also acts \ntherapeutically  in a very targeted  way when  the forks  are held in specific  areas  of acute  \ndistortion,  inducing  greater  order  into the system.  (p. 2) \nIn essence,  through  the use of tuning  forks,  sound  appears  to impact  the mind  and body  as if \ninner  and outer  states  of reality  are porous  and interconnected.  I find it similar  to Jung ’s notion  of \nthe unus  mundus.  This unifying  psychic field reaches  beyond  the imaginary  division  between  \npsyche  and matter."

As McKusick  (2014)  recalled:   \nIn science,  truth is, ideally,  an evolving  process,  not an absolute  destination.  Yet truth  be \ntold, even  after eighteen  years  of using  tuning  forks,  I still sometimes  cringe  when  I see \nother  people  using  them.  The thing  is, if my work  with forks  hadn ’t been so fascinating,  \nhadn ’t produced  such compelling  results,  I never  would  have  stuck  with it all these  years.  \n(p. 6) \nPerhaps  what  makes  her work  so compelling  from  an archetypal  perspective  is that sound  healing  \nthrough  tuning  forks  seems  to have  not only a psychological  effect  on the individual,  but it has \nthe potential  to transcend  the skeptic  in us as the experiences  with sound  healing  can often  be \nvery physical  and primal , pointing  to a mysterious  connection  between  the inner  and outer  states  \nof psyche.    \nI recognize  that sound  has its limitations,  for it is not accessible  or available  for all, \nespecially  not in the same  way that I have  come  to know  sound.  As noted  previously , the human  \near can only detect  a limited  range  between  20 to 20,000  Hz (McKusick , 2014,  p. 33). In this \ncase,  I am speaking  from  the perspective  of someone  who can hear and identify  sounds  as such,  \nbut I also want  to point  out that sound  is a frequency  and can be felt and experienced  in the body  \nbeyond  hearing.  I also recogniz e my biase s as a hearing  person  who is highly  sensitive  to subtle  \ntones  that impact  me physically  and emotionally.  Conversely,  since  sound  is also experienced  \nphysically  as a vibration,  this interaction  between  psyche  and matter  is where  possibly  the \narche typal  essence  of sound  impacts  us all to a degree.

However,  there  seems  to be a popular  draw  \ntoward  sound  healing,  and its importance  is becoming  more  prominent  in alternative  therapies.  \nMy personal  experience  with sound  therapy  has been  transformative , which  is something  I want  \nto understand  from  an archetypal  perspective.  Moreover,  McKusick  (2014)  pointed  out how,  in \nher practice  with tuning  forks:  \nI have  witnes sed many  extraordinary  and powerful  shifts  in people  from  this work:  the \ndiminishment  or eradication  of pain,  anxiety,  digestive  distress,  vertigo,  restless -leg \nsyndrome,  panic  attacks,  and various  forms  of “stuckness. ” Headaches,  TMJ,  back \ntension,  knee issues,  and herpes  outbreaks  have  all been  lessened  or dissipated  totally  \nthrough  sound  balancing.  The work  I have done  with people  suffering  from  PTSD  and \nsymptoms  from  concussions  has been  particularly  compelling.  (p. 6) \nWhat  makes  McKusick ’s findings  significant  is not in the proof  of sound ’s healing  impact  on \nmatter  and mind.  The significance  is the archetypal  implications  it has when  seeing  the \nmanifestations  of sound  waves  affecting  the individual  from  the perspective  of Jung ’s unus  \nmundus . In essence,  these  experiments  help to support  Jung ’s idea that the inner  and outer  realms  \nof reality  are interpenetrating  and that perhaps  sound  is a potential  conduit  to understand  this \nmysterious  and unconscious  relationship.   \nRelevanc e of the Topic for Depth Psychology  \nPerhaps one question that drives this study is that there are unknowns regarding the \nemotional and insti nctual associations with sound that might pertain to the unconscious realm."

The presence of sound in particular instances migh t transcend \ncause and effect, making this subject an important one to consider. This topic might be relevant \nfor depth psychology, as sound is all around us, affecting our lives daily. From the moment we \nrise to the moment we fall asleep, sound continuousl y vibrates in and around us. Therefore, we \nwould be remiss to ignore this persistent aspect of life as it seems to work its way into the \nemotional realms, as I will explore later in the literature review. What is missing in terms of our \ncurrent understandi ng of sound is an exploration of its relationship to the manifestation of the \nunconscious psyche in our lives. Sound has been studied in specific fields such as the healing \narts, cymatics (the study of sound waves on matter), music, and acoustics, yet stil l sound , in \nterms of its unconscious influences on us and its conveyance of archetypal dynamics, has yet to \nbe thoroughly researched.  \nIn contrast to what Jung believed about psyche and matter, for mainstream science, \nmatter and psyche are still seen as sep arate subjects that exist apart from one another. Certain \naspects of quantum physics and field theories are shifting some of these scientific mainstream \nnarratives to consider this unified reality , which I explore later in my study. In reference to these \ncontrasting positions, scholar, educator, activist, scientist, and author Fritjof Capra (1975/2010) \nin The Tao of Physics  wrote:  \nThe birth of modern science was preceded and accompanied by a development of \nphilosophical thought which led to an extreme form ulation of the spirit/matter dualism.   \nThis formulation appeared in the seventeenth century in the philosophy of Rene \nDescartes who based his view of nature on a fundamental division into two separate and \nindependent realms; that of mind ( res cogitans ), and that of matter ( res extensa ).

(p. 22)  \nThis divi sion between mind and matter has persisted in the scientific field for hundreds of years. \nHowever, with the development of modern physics, we are starting to see a return to a more \nunified perspective on the relationship between mind and matter. Capra (197 5/2010) explained \nhow “the roots of physics, as of all Western science, are to be found in the first period of Greek \nphilosophy in the sixth century BCE, in a culture where science, philosophy, and religion were \nnot separated ” (p. 20). This renewed perspec tive of the ancients can be found in the field theories \nI will discuss in this study, as well as in Jung ’s notion of the unus mundus.   \n  Nevertheless, a survey of the literature in the field suggests sound has not been \nadequately investigated from a Jungian perspective, and, strangely, Jung himself barely touched \non music in his writings. Therefore, this subject calls for further consideration regarding the \nnature of sound and its psychological significance for our lives. I will investigate the connec tions \nbetween the unus mundus and several new -science field theories and what their connection \nmight imply. I aim to explore sound as a potential bridge to further understand these invisible \nlinks and relationships dwelling in the unconscious.  Perhaps soun d might reveal itself through \nthis study as archetypal, as sound influences our physical bodies and psychology, which I will go \ninto later in my research.  \nDefinition of Terms  \nDepth  psychology  explores  the unconscious  and offers  tools  for a holistic  understanding  \nof the human  experience.

Ultimately,  analytic  \npsychology  guides  individuals  in forgin g a meaningful  relationship  with life’s symbolic  nature.  \nWith the emerg ing recognition of the collective unconscious, there arose a necessity for a \ncorresponding structural map of the human psyche.   \nArchetypes  \nMany philosophers, artists, and theorists thro ughout human history formulated notions \naround “primordial images ” that repeat and have universal occurrences; Jung (1936 –37/1969) \nposited these patterns came from archetypes (p. 55 [CW 9i, para. 118]). Classic thinkers highly \ninfluenced Jung ’s notion of archetypes from ancient Greece to the Romantic era and into the \nearly 20th century. Jung (1936 –37/1969) had a sense for  how these patterns manifested in one ’s \npsyche, as he felt they represented something about the nature of the collective unconscious and \nproposed there were core archetypes that dwelled in the unconscious  realm (p. 43 [CW 9i, para. \n88]). He speculated that these archetypes were part of a larger invisible structure, often referred \nto as the unus mundus or “one world ” (Jung, 1955 –56/1970, p. 462 [CW 14, para. 660]). The \narchetype, according to Jung (1936 –37/1969), “indicates the existence of definite forms in the \npsyche which seem to be present always and everywhere ” (p. 42 [CW 9i, para. 89]). In \nconsidering sound as an archetypal reality , “always and everywhere, ” I will investigate how \nsound manifests in cym atics and new sciences and could be understood as  a sonic and creative \nexpression of the unus mundus.  \nIn essence, archetypes from Jung ’s perspective are “primordial images ” that are \nmanifestations of the collective unconscious , which are recurring forms a nd patterns which"

Moreover, Jung ’s (1954/1969 a) notion of the \narchetype indicates they are forms stemming from the collective unconscious and that:  \nWhat the word “archetype ” means in the nominal sense is c lear enough, then, from its \nrelations with myth, esoteric teach ing, and fairytale. But if we try to establish what an \narchetype is psychologically, the matter becomes more complicated. This last is a typical \nmeans of expression for the transmission of col lective contents originally derived from \nthe unconscious. (p. 5 [CW 9i, para. 5])  \nAnother significant quote regarding archetypes highlights Jung ’s idea that they are often \nattributed to metaphysics or the greater cosmos. To this, Jung (1954/1969 a) wrote:  \nMankind has never lacked powerful images to lend magical aid against all the un canny \nthings that live in the depths of the psyche. Always the figures of the unconscious were \nexpressed in protecting and healing images and in this way were expelled from the  \npsyche into cosmic space. (p. 12 [CW 9i, para. 21])  \nJung ’s perspective on the archetype expands the potential to explore the unconscious content that \ntends to possess the psyche from dark and light aspects. As I investigate  the archetype ’s \nrelationship t o sound , it might illuminate the mysterious aspects of the unus mundus as it \ncontains the immensity of these archaic patterns.  \n As Platonic Forms . Archetypes tend to give rise to psychic contents that spill out of the \nunconscious above and beyond one ’s control. The archetype will often constellate certain \nbehaviors and patterns of thought and fantasies that are challenging for the individual to grasp \nconsciously. As mentioned earlier, prior to depth psychology, the notion of archetypes was \nrooted as far back as ancient Greece during the Platonic period. Jung (1954/1969 c) understood \nthat archetypes for Plato consisted “of the Idea as supraordinate and preexistent to all"

Jung ’s (1954/1969 c) work helped evolve our understanding of \narchetypes as evident in empirical experiences that are more grounded in personal encounters \nand are observable (p. 75 [CW 9i, para. 149]).   \n Nevertheless, Jung  still held the notion that the archetypes existed beyond our known \nreality and were therefore, at their core, unknowable (von Franz, 1992, p. 120). Concerning this, \nJung (1954/1969 a) emphasized in The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious  that with \narchetypes, “we are dealing with archaic or —I would say —primordial types, that is, with \nuniversal images that have existed since the remotest times ” (pp. 4 –5 [CW 9i, para. 5]). In other \nwords, they are embedded in one ’s psyche and are a collective experience  shared amongst all \nhuman beings. Overall, the study of archetypes has evolved over hundreds of years, and during \nJung ’s work, they developed greater associations with the psyche and the unconscious. \nAccording to Swiss author and Jungian analyst Marie -Louise von Franz  (1992):  \nThe archetypes of the collective unconscious are like these “seeds ”; They are \nimperceptible, invisible in a way, only potentially real; only when they become actualize d \nin the form of an archetypal image do they become “real,” and only  then do they seem to \nenter our consciousness and with it into our space -time world. (p. 120)  \nFrom this perspective, archetypes live outside our understanding of time and space. They exist in \na realm that is incomprehensible to our ego -consciousness. It is  only in brief moments that we \ncan glimpse their presence in our waking life. Both Jung and von Franz ’s views on archetypes \npropose how these patterns constellate in the psyche. I suggest their theories are relevant, as they \nmight help me as a researcher t o understand sound and its influences on the psyche from this \narchetypal perspective."

      "text": "ARCHETYPAL ASPECTS OF SOUND  \n 14 \nAs Instincts.  According to Jung (1948/1969 c), “the collective unconscious consists of \nthe sum of the instincts and their correlates, the archetypes. Just as everybody possesses instincts, \nso he also possesses a stock of archetypal images ” (p. 138 [CW 8, para. 281]). Instincts are \ninherent drives in the collective unconscious that often override conscious intention  if one is not  \naware  of them. In essence, the i nstincts are “observable physiological urges . . . they condition or \ninfluence psychic processes ” (Jung, 1948/1969 c, p. 329 [CW 11, para. 491]). Jung posited that \nthe instincts could be observed in instances such as schizophrenia , where the “psychopatholog y \nof mental disturbances . . . are characterized by an irruption of the collective unconscious ” \n(1948/1969 c, p. 138 [CW 8, para. 281]). Instincts are embedded in how society or the collective \nresponds to their surroundings. Another way to observe instincts  in terms of sound frequency \nmight be to look at the collective attitude toward certain music genres or cultural preferences \nrelated to music.  We can even observe infants react instinctively to calming or loud sounds in \ntheir environment . Additionally, w hen considering music culture, one might notice these \ninstincts at play in the collective, particularly with musical eras and music aesthetics.   \nJung (1954/1969 b) posited that the instincts contained dual aspects : “on the one hand it is \nexperienced as physio logical dynamism, while on the other hand its multitudinous forms enter \ninto consciousness as images and groups of images, where they develop numinous effect ” (p. \n212 [CW 8, para. 414]). Instincts, therefore, according to Jung, not only influence the physical \nbody but also impact one ’s psychic reality. The instincts then result in autonomous responses \nfrom the unconscious that manifest in many forms in the indi vidual and collective. Further, Jung \n(1954/1969 b) cautioned that coming into proximity of the instinctual world creates a sudden \n“urge to shy away from it and to rescue the light of consciousness from the murks of the sultry \nabyss ” (p. 212 [CW 8, para. 416 ]).
