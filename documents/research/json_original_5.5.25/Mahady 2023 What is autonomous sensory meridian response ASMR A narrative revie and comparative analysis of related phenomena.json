All rights reserved.What is autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)? A \nnarrative review and comparative analysis of related phenomena \nAidan Mahadya, Marcel Takaca,*, Alexander De Foeb \naSchool of Health and Biomedical Sciences, RMIT University, Australia \nbFaculty of Education, Monash University, Australia   \nARTICLE INFO  \nKeywords: \nAutonomous sensory meridian response \nASMR \nMisophonia \nSynesthesia \nFrisson \nFlow state \nRelaxation \nFunctional connectivity ABSTRACT  \nA narrative review of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) was carried out. Defini -\ntional factors relevant to ASMR were canvassed. Related, but distinctly unique, sensorial phe-\nnomena, including frisson, synaesthesia, and misophonia were considered. Finally, the status of \nliterature with respect to clinical outcomes, individual differences, and current research appli -\ncations was evaluated. ASMR is a nascent phenomenon that has rapidly progressed in scope and \ndepth of study throughout the past decade; a notable shift from brief-form studies to an increase \nin formalised trials is noted. Yet, critical questions remain unaddressed, including expectancy and \nplacebo effects, that future research should interrogate.   \n1.Introduction \nEmerging from a sensationalised internet trend commencing in 2008 (Andersen, 2014 ), Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response \n(ASMR) has gained research traction concerning its clinical efficacy and underlying psychological mechanisms. ASMR is an \nexperience-dependent sensation in which specific audio, visual and/or tactile stimuli, such as tapping or whispering, induce a (usually \npleasant) tingling sensation, typically occurring around the scalp and spine (Barratt & Davis, 2015 ). Unlike most sensory psychological \nphenomena that are first captured in the laboratory and later proliferate into the public sphere, ASMR demonstrates a curious inverse \npattern, having been observed via informal online discussion boards at onset. Its online community, referred to as the ASMR com-\nmunity or ’Whisper Community ’, was born out of small online forums, and continues to grow with creators on YouTube (Google, CA, \nUSA), with some earning subscriber counts of over two million (see Andersen, 2014; Smith & Snider, 2019 ). \nExisting reviews on ASMR are brief, and typically serve as broad overviews of the topic for medical practitioners or academic \nprofessionals who are unaware of its online popularity and pleasurable effects (see Niven & Scott, 2021; Reddy & Mohabatt, 2020 ). \nThese are helpful for providing information that is concise and scrutable but fail to capture the depth of ASMR research. This literature \nreview aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current ASMR research, as well as research in adjacent fields, such as that of \nmeditation and alertness, to garner deeper understanding of how ASMR should be conceptualised. Upon conclusion of the review, \ncriteria for the necessary components that define ASMR are outlined. The review will cover i) definitional factors, ii) ASMR ’s potential \ntherapeutic benefit, iii) related sensations, iv) individual differences, v) neurophysiological factors, vi) attentional concepts of ASMR, \nvii) the role of intimacy and copresence, and viii) the role of placebo and expectancy. In doing so, this review will serve as a useful \nresource for researchers aiming to understand ASMR or apply it in future studies. \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: marcel.takac@rmit.edu.au (M.

The tingling sensation is involuntary, atypical, non-medical and non-harmful, and is accompanied by \nfeelings of relaxation and calmness (Valtakari, 2019 ). The stimuli that induce tingling, termed triggers, are characteristically gentle, \nlow frequency and repetitive, such as whispering or softly tapping on plastic objects (Barratt et al., 2017 ). Most commonly, people seek \nout the experience of ASMR via online videos, wherein ASMR triggers are produced in close proximity to a microphone and camera to \noptimise the likelihood of inducing tingling (Barratt et al., 2017; Gallagher, 2016, Smith & Snider, 2019; Engelbregt et al., 2022 ). \nColloquially, the term is often conflated with the genre of online content which aims to induce ASMR (e.g., “I watched the ASMR ” as \nopposed to “the video induced ASMR ”). Thus, it is important to distinguish between the sensation of ASMR and the modality or the \n‘affective genre ’ that is utilised to induce ASMR (Smith & Snider, 2019 ). We recommend opting to use terms such as ‘ASMR content ’, \n‘ASMR stimuli ’, or ‘ASMR videos ’ to differentiate. Alternatively, ASMR is sometimes situated as a condition or a state of consciousness \n(Andersen, 2014 ; Roberts et al., 2019 ), due to the unique sensory components that overlap with altered states such as flow or Kundalini \n(Valanciute & Thampy, 2011 ). That is, someone who experiences ASMR ‘has ASMR ’ (i.e., “I have ASMR ”). Because the term has seen \nuse in so many different ways, for clarity we recommend using distinct and separate terms, such as ‘ASMR experiencer ’ or ‘ASMR user’. \nDespite being intentionally induced, the tingling sensation occurs involuntarily (McGeoch & Rouw, 2020; Poerio et al., 2018; Smith \n& Snider, 2019 ). ASMR it is often accompanied by increased skin conductance and reduced heart rate (Engelbregt et al., 2022; Poerio \net al., 2018; Valtakari, 2019 ). Typically beginning in the head, scalp and spine, ASMR sensations travel slowly outwards along the \nspine and to the limbs (Barratt & Davis, 2015; Kovacevich & Huron, 2019 ). It is also less commonly reported to occur in the legs, \nstomach, and throat (Barratt & Davis, 2015 ; Roberts et al., 2019 ). Sensations in these areas may resemble an inducer-concurrent \nrelationship, where different ASMR triggers cause sensations in different parts of the body (Barratt & Davis, 2015 ). The tingling is \ngenerally pleasant, and the experience has been equated to a low-grade euphoria (Ahuja, 2013 ). \nASMR triggers are primarily auditory, though they can also be visual, tactile, or emotional (Barratt et al., 2017; Poerio et al., 2018 ). \nAuditory triggers tend to be low frequency, gentle and repetitive, such as whispering, softly speaking, or tapping on objects with one’s \nfingers (see Fig. 1 & Fig. 2). In ASMR videos, these are enacted near a microphone. Visual triggers are similarly slow and repetitive \nwhich often elicit a sense of touch. Common in ASMR videos are repetitive hand movements that emulate touching the viewers ’ face by \nmoving close to the camera. Similarly, tactile triggers can occur by treating microphones as if they were the viewer ’s ears. ASMR can \nalso occur interpersonally by being closely examined (e.g., as though the viewer were a patient in a dentist ’s chair; Ahuja, 2013 ) or \nwhen witnessing good deeds; “when a classmate did me [sic] a favour ” (Smith & Snider, 2019, p. 44). These emotional elements of \nASMR are invoked in ASMR videos with close personal attention towards the camera, which is treated as the first-person perspective of \nthe viewer (Barratt et al., 2017; Poerio et al., 2018; Zappavigna, 2020 ). Auditory triggers are generally regarded as the primary aspect \nof ASMR, and other sensory elements supplemental (Barratt et al., 2017; Poerio et al., 2018 ). Questionnaire-driven research indicates \nthat the most popular types of triggers include whispering, close personal attention, and crisp sounds like fingernail tapping and \ncrinkling sounds (Barratt et al., 2017; Poerio et al., 2018 ).Fig. 2.. \n3.ASMR ’s therapeutic potential \nThe ever-increasing attention around ASMR is founded in claims that it is physiologically and psychologically beneficial (Garro, \n2017; Paszkiel et al., 2017; Poerio et al., 2018 ). Questionnaire-based research indicates that ASMR videos are most often used for \nFig. 1.Various triggers can bring about ASMR; some examples are illustrated here.

ASMR \nexperiencers have reported improvement in mood after listening to ASMR to a degree that researchers found a significant main effect \non mood (Barratt & Davis, 2015; Engelbregt et al., 2022 ). A pilot study also found that stress levels reduced faster for those who \nlistened to ASMR content compared to a control group (Paszkiel et al., 2020 ). Some respondents also claim ASMR assists with \nmanaging chronic pain (Barratt & Davis, 2015 ), although there are no data to support this. Considering the stimuli are self-accessible, \npose minimal psychological/physiological risk, and are relatively short in duration, some proponents of ASMR argue that these \nbenefits outweigh disadvantages from a therapeutic vantage point (Garro, 2017; Smith & Snider, 2019; Swart et al., 2022 ). Research \nalso indicates that electrophysiological decay effects lasting up to 45 minutes can persist after ASMR experiences have ended, sug-\ngesting that ASMR may provide lasting positive impacts on well-being (Swart et al., 2022 ). \nWhile strides have been made over the last decade in researching ASMR, little progress has been made in observing its benefits \nunder experimental conditions. Most of the research thus far has compared self-report data of ASMR experiencers versus that of non- \nexperiencers to identify unique characteristics associated with the sensation: Very few randomised control trials have been imple -\nmented. These trials typically examine ASMR ’s role on mood and sleep. In a review of external stimuli as auditory sleep aids, only three \nstudies were found that utilised experimental conditions to examine the effects of ASMR on sleep (Yoon & Baek, 2022 ). Two of these \nstudies utilised nature sounds such as rain, ocean waves and waterfalls instead of conventional ASMR triggers and one was conducted \nbefore the term ASMR was coined (see Williamson, 1992 ). This study ’s results showed a significant improvement in sleep depth, return \nto sleep, awakening, and quality of sleep for those exposed to the ocean sounds compared to the control group, who were not exposed \nto any sounds (Williamson, 1992 ). \nAnother study utilising rain sounds found significantly decreased scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Smith & \nWegener, 2003 ), indicating overall improvement in subjective sleep quality. The PSQI measures multiple facets of sleep, such as \nsubjective sleep quality and latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and \ndaytime dysfunction. The study also showed improvements to sleep latency and quality of sleep. Sleep latency refers to the time it takes \nto fall asleep, and sleep latency under 30 minutes is considered a good indicator of sleep quality and effectiveness of sleep related \ninterventions (Lichstein et al., 2003; Yoon & Baek, 2022 ). A more recent study categorising rain sounds as ASMR found that after 30 \ndays, listening to rain for 1 hour each night decreased PSQI scores and increased subjective quality of sleep significantly (Umbas et al., \n2021 ). These studies support the notion that external auditory stimuli can be used as a sleep aid; however, they do not utilise con-\nventional ASMR videos and triggers, instead using natural sounds, which belong to the white noise family (Yoon & Baek, 2022 ). ASMR \ntriggers exhibit commonalities with white noise and nature sounds (Yoon & Baek, 2022 ), such as the low frequency and lowered \nvolume (Barratt & Davis, 2015; Kovacevich & Huron, 2019 ). However, typical ASMR videos involve a greater variance of sound, \nincluding inconsistent sounds such as whispering and tapping. Additionally, there is also an increased sense of proximity in ASMR \nvideos compared to control talking head style videos (Kovacevich & Huron, 2019; Zappavigna, 2020 ), further differentiating it from \nexpansive natural sounds and white noise. In the studies that conflate ASMR and nature sounds, the sleep aid is primarily a masking \ntool to extraneous noise, much like white noise (Yoon & Baek, 2022 ), not something that the listener derives relaxation and pleasure \nfrom. This is another differentiation from ASMR, though ASMR likely also works as a masking tool. Therefore, to veraciously assess the \nimpact of ASMR, specific ASMR triggers must be incorporated into experimental designs. \nCurrently, two interventions using ASMR stimuli as a sleep aid exist. A randomised control intervention using ASMR roleplay \nvideos showed similar results to the interventions that used natural sounds, with improved scores on the PSQI and subjective sleep \nquality (Hardian et al., 2020 ). However, this intervention did not measure sleep latency. More recently, a study using ASMR as a sleep \naid in conjunction with a pillow resulted in 66 % of participants reporting good night sleeps after 7 days. The intervention also \ndecreased the number of participants who could not sleep steadily from 56 % to 11 % (Wang & Li, 2020 ). These findings are largely \npromising for ASMR as a therapeutically beneficial intervention, although more experimental research within this domain is war-\nranted. Separating participants into control, ASMR and nature sounds group could aid in assessing any differences between naturalistic \ntriggers and conventional ASMR triggers. \n4.Related sensations \nThe tingling sensation, particularly as it results from external stimuli, has been compared to similar, previously identified \nFig. 2.In most ASMR videos proximity of both the artist and objects intended to induce ASMR can be seen near the microphone.

Paresthesia is an umbrella term for abnormal tingling, prickling or itching \nsensations on the skin (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2019 ). Common transient forms of paresthesia include \nthe tingling sensation that occurs after obdormition (after one’s limb ‘falls asleep ’) or tweaking the ulnar nerve (hitting one’s funny \nbone; Sharif-Alhoseini et al., 2012 ). Chronic paresthesia is typically the result of neurological conditions affecting the central nervous \nsystem, like multiple sclerosis, or nerve entrapment syndromes like carpal tunnel (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and \nStroke, 2019 ). While ASMR arguably fits under the umbrella of paresthesia, considering it as such carries medical connotations that do \nnot align with ASMR ’s characteristics. ASMR is a non-medical and somatosensory experience which is typically positively valenced, \nunlike the discomfort associated with forms of medically induced paresthesia caused by medical conditions. Other related sensations \nare discussed. \n4.1. Frisson \nA comparison has been drawn with frisson, colloquially termed ‘aesthetic chills ’ (Colver & El-Alayli, 2016; Harrison & Loui, 2014 ). \nFrisson is a similarly spontaneous and satisfying tingling sensation that occurs as a result of intense aesthetic appreciation, often \naccompanied by pilomotor activation and feelings of awe, absorption, thrill, or subverted expectations (Blood & Zatorre, 2001; \nPanksepp, 1995; Sloboda, 1991 ). This moment of “peak pleasure ” is accompanied by a transient rush of tingles or chills (Bannister, \n2019, p. 2). Most commonly, frisson is experienced when listening to music, often during climactic moments such as key changes, \ntransitions into chorus ’, rapid increases in volume, or poignant lyrics (Harrison & Loui, 2014; Panksepp, 1995; Sloboda, 1991 ). Frisson \ncan also occur in other contexts that are visual and emotional, such as witnessing a beautiful natural scene (Goldstein, 1980 ), or getting \nchills while watching a frightening film (Sumpf et al., 2015 ). Frisson is accompanied by physiological changes such as cutis anserina (i. \ne., goosebumps; Harrison & Loui, 2014 ), activation of reward systems (Mori & Iwanaga, 2017 ) and pupil dilation (Laeng et al., 2016 ); \nthe latter of which has also shown to occur when experiencing ASMR (Lochte et al., 2018; Valtakari et al., 2019 ). \nWhile these sensations share commonalities, the overall experience and induction of tingling is markedly different (Collins, 2012; \nHigham, 2014 ). One distinction is that frisson is typically induced by musical stimuli while ASMR is induced by non-musical stimuli, \nwith survey data indicating music is non-conducive to experiencing ASMR (Barratt et al., 2017 ). Content analyses of ASMR videos \nidentify that ASMR stimuli is typically quieter, more proximate, with spoken audio typically whispered, with greater oral wetness and \nFig. 3.Comparison of ASMR with misophonia, frisson, and synaesthesia.

This is antithetical to the excitatory process of frisson (Grewe et al., 2011 ), which is often elicited by increases in \nvolume and broadening of the audio frequency range (Panksepp, 1995 ). The tingling sensation is transient, described as waves that \nrapidly propagate through the spine, neck, and arms (Huron, 2000; Mori & Iwanaga, 2017 ), which is usually deemed exhilarating. \nASMR, conversely, is distinctly relaxing, and tingles tend to radiate throughout one’s body in a slower and subdued manner (Barratt & \nDavis, 2015; Collins, 2012; del Campo & Kehle, 2016 ). In designing an ASMR assessment tool, Roberts et al. (2019) found a weak \npositive correlation between responses on their ASMR assessment tool and a frisson subscale (r 0.25, p D.001). They also found a \nweak positive correlation between frisson and the ASMR subfactor labelled movement (r 0.20, p D.001), indicating both tingling \nsensations travel through the body. \nSome forms of ASMR video, often titled as ‘satisfying ’, support the notion of aesthetic appreciation, where ASMR triggers are \npresented in a visually appealing way, such as systematically cutting up objects, popping bubble wrap, and playing with slime. These \nASMR triggers focus more on visual and simulated tactile stimulation, and do not have the typical characteristics of triggers: they often \ncontain high frequency popping sounds, in contrast to the general low frequency of ASMR triggers, and often lack the slow, gentle \nquality distinctive in ASMR content (Barratt et al., 2017; Kovacevich & Huron, 2019 ). Tingling resulting from these videos could be \ninterpreted as frisson, ASMR, or a combination of both. Therefore, the demarcating factor between ASMR and frisson may not be \nphysiological, but rather how the event is framed by the individual in a top-down manner via cognitive contextual cues. Tingling \nconsidered to be thrilling or exciting may be embodied as frisson, while relaxing tingling is perceived as ASMR. Kovacevich and Huron \n(2019) suggested that the self-reported divergence between ASMR and frisson may be due to misattribution. Because stimuli are more \ncognitively identifiable than affective states or responses, individuals may interpret the same response as different if it is induced by \ncontrasting stimuli. Dutton and Aron (1974) famously illustrated this as men experiencing vertigo attributed their feelings to infat-\nuation due to the presence of an attractive woman, rather than their fear of heights. This may be the case with ASMR and frisson, where \nthe stimuli is vastly different, and thus the resulting response is interpreted as different. \nKovacevich and Huron (2019) theorise that frisson and ASMR may both arise from the suppression of a fear response. Based in \nprevious research (Huron, 2006; McGraw, 1999; McGraw & Warren, 2010 ), they propose that the emotional contrast from embodying \na negative response like fear, to a positive response, results in an intensely pleasurable experience akin to frisson or ASMR. In \nmusically-induced frisson, an initial subcortical fear response arises from changes in volume and pitch, which is then consciously \nappraised as a non-threat, resulting in the pleasurable tingling (Huron, 2006 ). Kovacevich and Huron (2019) suggest that ASMR videos \ninduce a similar unconscious fear response through an initial sense of intense proximity, which raises arousal levels much like when an \ninsect buzzes close to one’s face, or someone whispers closely into one’s ear. They note that pilomotor activation is a common fear \nresponse, and ASMR users typically have high neuroticism (Fredborg et al., 2017 ; see Section 5), which predispose a greater sensitivity \nto threat. \n4.2. Synaesthesia \nASMR and frisson are reminiscent of synaesthetic stimulations (Roberts et al., 2019 ). Synaesthesia is a condition which affects \nroughly 4.4 % of the population (Simner et al., 2006 ), wherein stimulation of one sensory domain triggers a reaction in another sensory \ndomain, often causing an overlay and intermingling of sensory interpretations. Specific letters and numbers may be associated with \ncolours (grapheme-colour synaesthesia; Rich & Mattingley, 2002 ), or musical notes may elicit experience of colour (Chromesthesia; \nCytowic & Eagleman, 2011 ). In the case of ASMR and frisson, specific sounds elicit emotional and tactile reactions. Amongst a sample \nof ASMR experiencers, 5.9 % self-identified as synesthetes, though scholars have argued that this sample difference is not a significant \ndeparture from rates in the general population, nor does synaesthesia appear central to the ASMR construct (Barratt & Davis, 2015 ). \nOther scholars suggest that ASMR is a form of auditory-tactile synesthesia, in which specific auditory stimuli elicit tactile reactions in \nthe form of tingling (Barratt & Davis, 2015; Smith et al., 2017 ). While there is some overlap between ASMR experiencers and syn-\nesthetes (Barratt & Davis, 2015 ), this likely implies an overall sensitivity to auditory stimuli, rather than a correlation between the two. \nFurthermore, it is important to consider the emotional well-being component of ASMR and the positive feelings which are associated, \nas typical synesthesia is neither positive nor negative, it is a consistent and automatic perceptual response (e.g. ‘the number 2 is always \nred’; McGeoch & Rouw, 2020; Simner et al., 2006 ). Mirror touch synaesthesia, where witnessing, but not recieving, physical touch \nillicits touch sensations, was found to be more common in ASMR experiencers when compared to controls (Gillmeister et al., 2022 ) \n4.3. Misophonia \nLiterally translating to ‘hatred of sound ’, misophonia is a disorder in which specific sounds trigger intense negative emotional and \nphysiological responses like rage, physical discomfort, and the fight or flight response (Brout et al., 2018; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001; \nRouw & Erfanian, 2018; Spence, 2020 ). Misophonic triggers are typically repetitive, and human-made sounds, such as chewing, loud \nbreathing and pen clicking (Brout et al., 2018; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). As these sounds are common ASMR triggers (Kovacevich & \nHuron, 2019 ), one might assume ASMR experiencers are characteristically unlikely to experience misophonia. Conversely, findings \nindicate that those who suffer with misophonia are more likely to experience ASMR (Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2018; Rouw & \nErfanian, 2018 ), further supporting the notion that ASMR experiencers have an overall sensitivity to auditory stimuli. This suggests \nthat the context surrounding the noise may alter an individuals ’ reaction to it (see Section 9.1). Indeed, the first definition of miso-\nphonia cited in literature specified that misophonic reactions occurred in specific situations or settings, rather than as a result of the \nloudness or frequency of the sound (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001; 2014 ).

While physio -\nlogically similar to frisson, ASMR is experientially different and ultimately occurs in complex contexts, with divergent emotions \nattached; namely relaxation instead of excitement and awe. ASMR, frisson, misophonia and misokinesia (hatred of repetitive or fidgety \nmovements) could be part of a spectrum based on the intensity and pleasurability of certain sounds, but more research is needed to \nuncover whether this is the case. Potentially, ASMR and frisson lie on one end, as they result from extreme positive reactions to stimuli, \nwhile misophonia and misokinesia lie on the opposite end. We advocate that synaesthesia is demarcated separately from ASMR, frisson \nand misophonia, as it typically does not involve an emotional reaction, but rather a consistent interpretation of external stimuli that \nresults from the engagement of multiple sensory domains. Synaesthesia presents as a perceptual phenomenon that occurs constantly, \nwhile ASMR is a stimuli-dependent sensation which only occurs situationally. \nWhile not extensively researched in ASMR literature, context is known to be critical in ASMR, with survey research indicating \nindividuals are less likely to experience ASMR in noisy or stressful environments (Barratt et al., 2017). Additionally, a popular \ndiscourse within the ASMR community considers how some triggers, such as mouth sounds, can be relaxing in the context of an ASMR \nvideo, but misophonic in other contexts. While misophonia refers specifically to sound-related discomfort, ASMR triggers can be \nauditory, visual, emotional or tactile. Counterpart/related disorders such as misokinesia and haphephobia (hatred/fear of being \ntouched) are closely related to both misophonia and ASMR, yet distinct constructs (Jaswal et al., 2021). \n5.Individual differences \nBoth state and trait-oriented research points to substantial variance across individual reports in ASMR-based trials. The Highly \nSensitive Person Scale, (HSPS; Aron & Aron, 1997) is a self-report scale measuring Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS). SPS is a trait \ncharacterised by an increased sensitivity of the central nervous system (CNS), deep cognitive processing, greater sensitivity to subtle \nstimuli and heightened emotional reactivity (Booth et al., 2015; Boterberg & Warreyn, 2016; Greven et al., 2019). ASMR sensitivity has \nbeen correlated with greater SPS scores (Roberts et al., 2020b). ASMR sensitivity is also correlated with higher absorption (Janik \nMcErlean & Osborne-Ford, 2020) and fantasising (Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2017), traits measuring one’s propensity to immerse \noneself into media one consumes, such as television shows and movies, to an extent that one loses track of time or forget about one’s \nsurroundings (Davis, 1980; see Tellegen, 1981; Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974). ASMR experiencers were also found to score higher on \nempathic concern (Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2017) on the Inter-Personal Reactivity Index (IPR; Davis, 1980), and a greater reactivity \nto interpersonal touch (Gillmeister et al., 2022). Positive correlations between ASMR sensitivity and other consciousness dimensions \nhave also been observed via the ASMR-15 (Roberts et al., 2021):  \na) Body consciousness: The tendency to focus on bodily sensations like hunger or heartbeat (Miller et al., 1981).  \nb) Transliminality: A lack of separation between mental processes, encompassing experiences such as lucid dreaming, absorption, \nmystical experiences, and increased sensitivity to external stimuli (Lange et al., 2000).  \nc) Unusual experiences (UE): Cognitive and sensory experiences like synaesthesia, dreams, and fantasy (Rawlings, 2002). \nThese results indicate a higher emotional capacity or predisposition to engage with actors in ASMR videos, and a greater sensitivity \nto the stimuli presented in these videos. Links between flow, absorption, mindfulness, suggestibility, and other constructs interrelated \nwith ASMR, are discussed further on in this review (see Section 7). \nASMR experiencers have been found to have higher openness to experience (Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2017; Roberts et al., \n2020b), higher neuroticism (Fredborg et al., 2017), and lower conscientiousness (Fredborg et al., 2018; Janik McErlean & Banissy, \n2017; Roberts et al., 2020b), as per Costa and McCrae’s (1992) five-factor model of personality, the BFI. Openness to experience refers \nto one’s curiosity, appreciation for abstract concepts and creativity (John & Srivastava, 1999) and encapsulates the type of person who \nmay be willing to engage in an unconventional aesthetic experience like ASMR. This relationship could be slightly skewed by the fact \nthat the average age of ASMR experiencers is younger (Barratt & Davis, 2015), and notably openness tends to be higher in younger \ndemographics and reduces with age (McCrae & Terracciano, 2005). Since ASMR is commonly used for stress relief (Barratt et al., \n2017), those who are more prone to stress, or highly neurotic, may be more inclined to engage with ASMR. Additionally, a study of the \npersonality inventory found the best predictor of openness was the tendency to experience chills during aesthetic experiences, akin to \nfrisson (Costa & McCrae, 1992; McCrae, 2007). Higher openness is also common in those who experience frisson (Colver & El-Alayli, \n2016). Studies have also found lower scores in conscientiousness (Fredborg et al., 2018; Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2017; Roberts \net al., 2020b). Low conscientiousness has been associated with nervousness and increased reactivity to stressors (Komulainen et al., \n2014; Merecz et al., 1999). As ASMR is associated with increased galvanic skin response (Poerio et al., 2018), the physiological profile \nof ASMR experiencers and low conscientious individuals overlaps. To this point, Engelbregt et al. (2022) found that only those who \nscored low in conscientiousness showed significant changes in skin conductance from ASMR. Low extroversion and agreeableness have \nalso been observed in ASMR experiencers compared to non-experiencers (Fredborg et al., 2017); however, this relationship has not \nbeen supported in similar studies. \nSensory suggestibility is a trait which measures one’s propensity to respond physiologically to sensory information that is covertly \nimplied or inferred (Gheorghiu et al., 1995; Marotta et al., 2016). The Sensory Suggestibility Scale (SSS; Gheorghiu et al., 1995) \nmeasures this trait by employing exercises in which an instructor subtly implies that a specific task/s will cause a directly linked \nresultant physical sensation (e.g., shining a light onto a participant’s face is falsely implied to create a sense of warmth on their face). In \nthis example, those with higher sensory suggestibility will report a sense of warmth despite its physiological impossibility. ASMR \nexperiencers score significantly higher on the SSS than control individuals (see Keizer et al., 2020). That is, ASMR experiencers are A. Mahady et al."

Suggestibility is also related to unusual experiences (Acunzo et al., 2020 ), traits which are \ncommon in ASMR experiencers. This may explain the popularity of tactile triggers in ASMR videos, which simulate feelings of touch. In \nthese instances, the video performer touches microphones or the camera lens to imply a sense of touch on the viewers ears or face. For \nexample, a performer covers the top half of the frame with their palm, encouraging the viewer to feel the presence of bodily heat on \ntheir forehead (Gentle Whispering, 2019 ). Alternatively, this could suggest that ASMR itself is a placebo or a perceptual suggestion \neffect, which occurs in those who are more prone to anomalous perceptual states in response to suggestion (see Section 9). \nTaken together, the higher scores on neuroticism, sensory processing sensitivity, sensory suggestibility, body consciousness, \nempathy and transliminality, along with lower scores on conscientiousness, suggest that ASMR users tend to be emotionally and \nstimulatorily sensitive/reactive. They also tend to exhibit imaginative and creative tendencies, illustrated by higher scores in openness \nto experience, fantasising, absorption, observing and unusual experiences. Many of these trends co-occur in synaesthetic individuals, \nwho have been found to have higher openness, neuroticism, fantasising and absorption, and lower conscientiousness (Banissy et al., \n2012, 2013; Chun & Hup�e, 2016; Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2017; Rader & Tellegen, 1987 ). \n\u0000↗\u0000×\u0000↘\u0000≡\u0000⊗\u0000±\u0000∓\u0000≺\u0000≫\u0000≃\u0000≼\u0000⊙\u0000∓\u0000≤\u0000∓\u0000→\u0000⊙\u0000⊘\u0000⊇\u0000≤\u0000© \u0000⇒\u0000⊇\u0000≼\u0000≡\u0000≼\u0000©\u0000∓\u0000≥\u0000©\u0000≈\u0000⊂\u0000⊃\u0000≪\u0000©\nSensitivities to stimuli may be explained by atypical connectivity and/or cross activations between brain regions in those who \nexperience ASMR (Smith et al., 2017, 2019b, 2020; McGeoch & Rouw, 2020 ). A series of studies by Smith et al. (Smith et al., 2017, \n2019b, 2020 ) found atypical functional connectivity in ASMR experiencers. Functional connectivity describes when neuronal firing in \none brain region is statistically associated with neuronal firing in a separate brain region (Friston, 1994 ). Functionally connected areas \nof the brain form resting state networks that are often associated with particular functions (van den Heuvel & Sporns, 2013 ). The \ndefault mode network (DMN) is one such resting state network and is associated with internally directed thought and attention, or a \ndisconnection from external stimuli (Buckner et al., 2008 ; Greicius et al., 2003; Raichle, 2015 ). \nSmith et al. (2019b) found that ASMR listeners had reduced functional connectivity in the salience and visual networks and the \nDMN, as well as atypical connectivity in the central executive and sensorimotor networks. They also found increased connectivity \nbetween the occipital, frontal and temporal cortices, suggesting the brain regions of ASMR listeners are less compartmentalised than \nnon-experiencers (Smith et al., 2017 ). Taken together, this indicates a de-compartmentalisation of brain networks, which may help to \nexplain how auditory and visual stimuli result in the unique tingling sensation of ASMR. Smith et al. (2017) also suggested that ASMR \nmay result from an inability to inhibit sensory motor experiences, producing an uncontrollable tingling sensation (Smith et al., 2017 ). \nThis lack of sensory control could explain the higher absorption found in ASMR experiencers, as well as the higher sensory suggest -\nibility Keizer et al. (2020) observed. ASMR may also impact executive function, with research finding set shifting (the ability to switch \nfocus between mental tasks; Miyake et al., 2000; Wilson et al., 2018 ) and inhibitory control (ability to supress a response, feeling or \naction; Miyake et al., 2000 ) were impeded after experiencing ASMR (Wang et al., 2020 ). This adds credence to the theory that ASMR \nresults from an inability to inhibit sensory motor experiences. \nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Smith et al. (2019a) also found greater activity in the cingulate gyrus, right \nparacentral lobule, and bilateral thalamus in ASMR experiencers in comparison to a control group that was presented with ASMR \ninducing stimuli; these brain regions are associated with emotion, behaviour regulation, alertness, and attention (Craig, 2003; Flor-\nesco, 2015; Gasquoine, 2013 ). A similar fMRI study found that activity in the insulae, nuclei accumbens and supplementary motor \nareas was associated with an experience of ASMR tingles (Locthe et al., 2018 ). These brain regions are associated with reward (Schultz \n2000 ), arousal (Oliveri et al., 2003 ), empathy, and affiliate behaviours/social grooming (Craig, 2009 ). \n6.1. Model for ASMR and misophonia \nDrawing from ASMR research on misophonia, synaesthesia and functional connectedness, McGeoch and Rouw (2020) proposed \nthat both ASMR and misophonia stem from synaesthetic cross-activations between the auditory cortex and parts of the brain related to \nhomeostasis. They consider Craig ’s (2009 , 2014) concept of the Global Emotional Moment, which states that inputs from various brain \nregions aggregate in the anterior insula cortex to form a representation of one’s current emotional state. Using this model, McGeoch \nand Rouw (2020) contend that firings in the auditory cortex, which is housed adjacent to the insula, cross-activate with the anterior \ninsula cortex to influence the global emotional moment. This can cause an intensely positive emotional moment, indicative of ASMR, \nor an intensely negative misophonic moment (McGeoch & Rouw, 2020 ). \nAs established by Smith et al. (2019b, 2020) , individuals who are sensitive to ASMR tend to have less functional connectivity, \nwhich indicates that distributed neuronal networks and distinct brain regions could cross-activate to induce ASMR. McGeoch and \nRouw ’s (2020) research team considered the valence theory of emotion; in that positive and negative emotions are lateralised to the \nleft and right side of the brain respectively (Demaree et al., 2005 ). There is evidence the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is similarly \nlateralised (Craig, 2009 , 2014 ), with the left insula implicated in parasympathetic activity, and sympathetic activity on the right \n(Oppenheimer et al., 1992 ). McGeoch and Rouw (2020) contend that, while activating both sides of the ANS (parasympathetic and \nsympathetic), ASMR likely involves an overall shift to the parasympathetic nervous system. Misophonia, conversely, involves an \noverall shift to the sympathetic nervous system. \n6.2.

Alpha power (8 – 13 Hz) is associated with the suppression of distractor stimuli \n(Foxe & Snyder, 2011; Jensen et al., 2002; Kelly et al., 2006 ), which, according to the alpha inhibition timing hypothesis, facilitates \nrelaxed states by inhibiting disruptive stimuli or brain regions (Klimesch et al., 2007 ). Increased alpha is also associated with \nmaintaining meditative states (Aftanas & Golocheikine, 2001 ) and relaxation (Niedermeyer, 1999 ). Alpha oscillations have been \nobserved to increase in parietal, frontal, and temporal regions whilst viewing ASMR content (Fig. 4; Fredborg et al., 2021; Swart et al., \n2022 ), providing support to the concept that ASMR is akin to a flow state. The inhibitory processes typical of increased alpha may also \nfacilitate internally directed attention (Cooper et al., 2006 ; Magosso et al., 2019 ; Matsuoka et al., 2021 ), or the selection of relevant \nsocial cues, which may play a role in the perception of co-presence and sense of intimacy with the performers in ASMR videos (Symons \net al., 2016 ; see Section 8 of this review). However, Engelbregt et al. (2022) found contrasting results, with EEG showing a decrease in \nalpha in subjects who experience tingles. Rather, they observed increases in beta oscillations (12 – 25 Hz) which they attributed to \nimproved focused attention and immersion, as per previous research (Travis & Shear, 2010 ). Similarly, in addition to their findings on \nalpha activity Fredborg et al., (2021) also observed increased sensorimotor rhythm activity (12 – 15 Hz) specifically when participants \nexperienced tingling sensations, which may also suggest increased focus attention. Gamma power (F30 Hz) was also observed to \nincrease during moments of tingling. \nInterpreting data on oscillatory power must be done with caution. While various studies have found that meditative states increase \nalpha power (Aftanas & Golocheikine, 2001; Huang & Lo, 2009; Dunn et al., 1999 ), some have demonstrated the opposite (Baijal & \nNarayanan, 2010; Cahn & Polich, 2006; Cahn et al., 2010; Travis & Wallis, 1999 ). When control conditions have been applied to \naccount for general relaxation, these studies have found no changes or even decreases in alpha wave levels (Baijal & Narayanan, 2010; \nCahn & Polich, 2006; Cahn et al., 2010; Travis & Wallis, 1999 ). Some neuroscience research has indicated that alpha waves are \nindicative of wakefulness, attention and task load (Klimesch, 1999; Strijkstra et al., 2000 ). While this may detract from Fredborg ’s \n(2021) findings, it is indicative of the complex, focused attention that is required for ASMR to be induced in participants. \n7.Attentional concepts of ASMR \nThe relaxing and pleasurable elements of ASMR expand beyond just the transient moments of tingling. Researchers have explored \nwhether experiencing ASMR could be considered an altered state of consciousness, wherein the individual enters a trance-like state of \npleasurable absorption, which could potentially aid the induction of ASMR tingles (Roberts et al., 2019 ). Indeed, when making the \nASMR-15, a scale assessing ASMR sensitivity, factor analysis identified a sub factor which pertained to altered states of consciousness \n(Roberts et al., 2019 ). This factor included items such as ‘It feels as though I have slipped into a hypnotic, trance-like state ’ and ‘I \nexperience time distortions ’. Various altered states of consciousness and concepts of alertness that overlap with characteristics of \nASMR are discussed. \n7.1. Mindfulness \nMindfulness involves a non-judgemental, present moment awareness of one’s own thoughts and feelings (Bishop et al., 2004 ), and \nis known to produce positive physiological effects such as stress reduction and sleep improvement (Gu et al., 2015 ). With ASMR ’s \nproposed benefits including the aforementioned physiological effects (Barratt & Davis, 2015 ), researchers have drawn links between \nthe two (del Campo, 2019; Fredborg et al., 2018; Scofield, 2019 ). The increased sensitivity to external stimuli resultant from trait \nmindfulness (trait mindfulness being an individual ’s propensity to engage in mindfulness; Harrison and Clark, 2016 ) may aid the \ninduction of ASMR (del Campo, 2019 ). Alternatively, a present focus on external stimuli and one’s sensorial response to it may induce a \nmeditative state of relaxation (Fredborg et al., 2018; Scofield, 2019 ). Positive correlations have been found between ASMR sensitivity \nand overall mindfulness scale scores (Fredborg et al., 2018 ) as well as the mindfulness sub-factors, observing (del Campo, 2019; \nScofield, 2019 ) and curiosity (Fredborg et al., 2018 ). Observing describes the level to which one notices and attends to experiences \nFig. 4.General areas of activation in ASMR when compared with control participants during ASMR audio.

While these correlations were significant, other aspects of mindfulness, such as a lack of judgement of one’s inner \nexperience, and non-reactivity to one’s inner experience, were not significantly correlated with ASMR, and were negatively correlated \nwith misophonia (Scofield, 2019). Additionally, Roberts et al. (2021) found a negative correlation between a mindfulness scale and the \nASMR-15 scale, proposing instead that trait mindfulness is incompatible with the absorption aspects of ASMR (see Section 7.2). This \nindicates that ASMR tends to involve high present-moment awareness with intense observation and external curiosity, but lacks the \ndetached, third-person perspective that often occurs in mindfulness practices. \n7.2. The flow state \nOther research has indicated that experiencing ASMR is much like Csikszentmihalyi’s flow state (1991). The flow state is defined as \na state of focus wherein someone is completely immersed in an activity (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991) and is associated with optimal \nperformance in sport and other activities (dos Santos et al., 2018; Swann et al., 2015). Non-active aspects of flow, such as the increased \nstate of focus, greater presence, intrinsic reward and transformation of time (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2009), are consistent with \nanecdotal reports (Barratt & Davis, 2015), neurophysiological aspects and personality correlates associated with ASMR (Janik \nMcErlean & Osborne-Ford, 2020; Scofield, 2019). Those who reported susceptibility to a wider range of ASMR triggers were more \nlikely to report greater flow experiences (Barratt & Davis, 2015). ASMR is associated with increased absorption and observing (Janik \nMcErlean & Osborne-Ford, 2020; Scofield, 2019), and some EEG correlates of ASMR are consistent with flow experiences (Katahira \net al., 2018), namely increased frontal theta and frontocentral alpha rhythms (Swart et al., 2022). Mindfulness and flow are in many \nways antithetical, as mindfulness involves a high level of self-awareness, while flow describes a lack of perception of self and sur-\nroundings (Janik McErlean & Osborne-Ford, 2020; Roberts et al., 2021). Some researchers have found reason to consider the two \nexperientially incompatible (Sheldon et al., 2015). Fredborg et al. (2020) suggest that ASMR is a heterogeneous phenomenon. While \nsome experience ASMR with high present-moment awareness, with a mindful focus on the sounds and visuals created in ASMR, others \nmay find it a less engaging, more relaxing phenomenon. Perhaps those who experience ASMR mindfully do so less with the intention to \nemotionally connect with the stimuli, but rather focus on the sounds and their sensory effect on the body, whilst those who enter flow \nbecome engaged with the media on a personal level, where they feel connected to the ASMRtist who created the video or the goings-on \nwithin the video. Alternatively, a side-effect of the ASMR itself could induce a state of mindful observation. \n7.3. Arousing relaxation \nWhile ASMR is broadly defined as a relaxing phenomenon, research suggests it also has physiological markers of an arousal \nresponse. In addition to the sensorial tingling, findings (Poerio et al., 2018) also show that ASMR increases skin conductance and pupil \ndilation (Valtakari, 2019), suggesting arousal. However, concurrent findings (Engelbregt et al., 2022; Poerio et al., 2018) also show \nreduced heart rate, which is typically indicative of a relaxation response. This paradoxical blending of arousal and relaxation is \nphysiologically possible (Croft et al., 2004; Crone et al., 2004) and suggests that ASMR is a unique and complex sensation that involves \nactivations of multiple brain regions, such as the parasympathetic nervous system, sympathetic nervous system, and brain regions \nassociated with emotion. Such observations also support McGeoch and Rouw’s (2020) theory that cross-activation occurs within the \nbrain; however, those authors posited that there is greater activity in the parasympathetic NS, producing what is overall a relaxing \nresponse. Poerio et al. (2018) argued that this arousing relaxation indicates a complex emotional response involved with ASMR (see \nthe following section for further discussion of this point). Notably, no study has published findings on heart rate variability (HRV), \nwhich is a useful measure of ANS activity (Sztajzel, 2004; Taelman et al., 2009) that could further illuminate how ASMR interacts with \nboth the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. It is predicted that ASMR would cause a decreased HRV, as findings suggest \nHRV increases during stress (Kim et al., 2018). Engelbregt et al. (2022) suggest that this unique NS response could be explained by \ndirectional fractionation, which describes the phenomenon of the simultaneous increase in sympathetic and parasympathetic acti-\nvation which accompanies attention to the external environment (Libby et al., 1973). As attention-interest increased in participants \nwho were shown 30 images of varying attractivity, increased pupillary dilation and decreased heart rate was observed (Libby et al., \n1973). \nThe attentional aspects of ASMR point to an overall increase in focused attention, as supported by EEG findings (Engelbregt et al., \n2022; Fredborg et al., 2021; Swart et al., 2022) and personality correlates relating to absorption and observing (Janik McErlean & \nOsborne-Ford, 2020; Scofield, 2019). Curiously however, Engelbregt et al. (2022) found no significant differences on attention be-\ntween ASMR and control conditions via the Eriksen Flanker Test (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974). Researchers suspect this may have been \ndue to a ceiling effect, as the average score was near the maximum. They suggest future research implements a more difficult test of \nattention. \nFurther research into alertness variability, such as phasic alertness and tonic alertness may aid understanding with how ASMR \ncould involve an unusual blend of focused attention, relaxation, and arousal. Phasic alertness involves a temporary high capacity to \nreact to stimuli and activates the sympathetic nervous system (Amihai & Kozhevnikov, 2014; Sturm et al., 1999; Weinbach & Henik, \n2011). Tonic alertness describes an optimal state of vigilance which lasts for an extended period of time and is known to co-occur with \nrelaxation (Britton et al., 2014; Posner, 2008; Sturm et al., 1999). Tonic alertness is correlated with activation of the parasympathetic \nnervous system and has been shown to occur during some forms of Buddhist meditation (Amihai & Kozhevnikov, 2014, Britton et al., \n2014). ASMR fits the profile of tonic alertness, involving parasympathetic activity and relaxation. Alternatively, ASMR may involve a \nunique form of alertness that combines aspects of phasic and tonic alertness. A. Mahady et al."

      "text": "Consciousness and Cognition 109 (2023) 103477\n108.Co-presence, emotional complexity, social grooming, sexuality \nASMR content often constructs a sense of co-presence, which may help immerse viewers and increase the induction of tingles \n(Zappavigna, 2020). Co-presence, or social presence, refers to the sensation of being with others in physical and digital contexts (Zhao, \n2003), to an extent that one relates attentionally, emotionally and behaviourally with another party (Campos-Castillo & Hitlin, 2013). \nIn the context of digital spaces, and thus ASMR content, this relates to the feeling that one is both perceiving and being perceived by the \nother party, despite not actually interacting (Zappavigna, 2020). \nA popular form of ASMR video is a roleplay, in which an actor plays a character that seemingly interacts with the viewer by talking \ndirectly into the camera (Ahuja, 2013). Roleplays typically occur in staged clinical settings, such as a doctor performing an exami -\nnation, or a hairdresser performing a haircut (Ahuja, 2013; Ahuja & Ahuja, 2019; Zappavigna, 2020). They can also be staged as more \nintimate interactions, such as roleplaying as the viewer’s significant other. These pre-recorded videos elicit digital intimacy and co- \npresence through intentional uses of language, visuals and audio that make the viewer feel involved and immersed (Zappavigna, \n2020). Interactional context is produced by acknowledging the viewer’s presence and greeting them, while adding in pauses for the \nviewer to theoretically respond. Conversational and interpersonal tones are reinforced with responses such as ‘mmhmm’ and ‘yes’. \nClose personal attention is elicited by the performer standing close to the camera and interacting with microphones as if they are a part \nof the viewer’s body. This serves to illicit mirror touch synaesthesia, which commonly occurs in ASMR users (Gillmeister et al., 2022). \nThese videos often use binaural audio that mimics human hearing. That is, there are two microphones that are lateralised to the left and \nright side, and localised to each ear. This aims to bring the viewer into the environment of the video. \nIts clear association with co-presence suggests that ASMR is more than an isolated physiological response and features cognitive \nconstructs involving at least some degree of social consciousness. Lochte et al. (2018) and Poerio et al. (2018) suggested that ASMR \nmay simulate a form of social grooming or affiliate behaviours. Social grooming occurs in animals such as birds, apes and humans, \nwhere social bonds are built by cleaning or maintaining fellow species’ appearance (Dunbar, 2010; Henazi & Barrett, 1999; Kenny \net al., 2017). Social grooming is an example of an affiliate behaviour, which facilitates well-being through the release of endorphins \nand neuropeptides (Dunbar, 2010; Feldman, 2012). Social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) may play a role in future research that is \nyet to examine whether the neuropeptides and endorphins released during these behaviours are also released during ASMR. \n8.1. Complex emotional response \nAdditionally, Poerio et al. (2018) suggested that ASMR involves a mixed or complex emotional response that activates multiple \nparts of the brain that would not otherwise typically be active together (Berrios et al., 2015). Experiences such as nostalgia or frisson, \nwhich involve both happiness and sadness (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2011; Blood & Zatorre, 2001; Wildschut, Sedikides, Arndt, & \nRoutledge, 2006), are examples of mixed emotional responses, and are consistent with the physiological profile of ASMR (Poerio et al., \n2018). That is, these experiences are not strictly lateralised to the parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous system, but involve \nconcurrent arousing and relaxing responses (Berrios et al., 2015). \n8.2. Sexuality in ASMR \nColloquial understanding of ASMR often differs from scientific and academic work done in the field. Not only are ascribed defi-\nnitions different, but so too are public perceptions. For example, a prevalent belief that ASMR is not only pseudoscientific, but also \nsexual in nature, persists (Brand, 2015; Waldron, 2017). This threatens the legitimisation of ASMR as a physiologically and psycho -\nlogically affecting sensation. Many ASMR studies are concerned with the proliferation of myths about ASMR and report data to \nchallenge them; for example, including questionnaire-based responses indicating that most ASMR listeners do not engage with ASMR \nfor sexual stimulation (Barratt et al., 2017), or that most ASMR creators do not intend their work to be sexual (Starr et al., 2020). Starr \net al. (2020) consider the role of ‘sensuality’ in ASMR, defined by pleasurable stimulation of senses that can include sexual phenomena, \nbut more broadly encompasses non-sexual phenomena (see Heathwood, 2007). Research alternatively suggests that ASMR is typically \nused for stress and anxiety relief, falling asleep, and general relaxation (Barratt & Davis, 2015, Poerio et al., 2018). This is supported by \ndata which show reductions in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck et al., 1996) scores post viewing ASMR (Barratt & Davis, 2015). \nASMR has also been found to improve sleep patterns, with an intervention resulting in 66 % of participants reporting good night sleeps \nafter 7 days (Wang & Li, 2020). \nWhile ASMR grew in popularity on platforms such as YouTube (Google, CA, USA) with long-form content, short-form ASMR \ncontent is becoming increasingly abundant on platforms such as Instagram (Meta, USA) and, more recently, Tik Tok (ByteDance, \nChina). Additionally, live ASMR on streaming services such as Twitch.tv has also grown in popularity, wherein sexually-charged ASMR \nis widespread. Much of this sexual ASMR lacks the characteristics of conventional ASMR. Rather, it involves performance of implicitly \nerotic acts under the guise of ASMR to circumvent many sites’ terms of service, which ban sexually-explicit content (Starr et al., 2020). \nSuch occurrence was frequent in China, with the false use of ASMR terminology applied to circumvent the nationwide ban of \npornography. This resulted in the Chinese government banning ASMR in 2018 due to the rise in ‘vulgar’ ASMR content (SHDF, 2018). \nSimilar scrutiny has occurred on YouTube, with some ASMR channels losing the ability to earn advertising revenue due to the videos \nbeing labelled inappropriate (Blue, 2018). \nIn wake of the ASMR ban in China, Starr et al. (2020) conducted a content analysis of Chinese ASMR performances. They argued \nthat Sexual ASMR (S-ASMR), is a different medium to conventional ASMR, given the array of different production techniques, lin-\nguistic choices and affective stances employed. Visually, S-ASMR videos utilise downcast framing to highlight the performer’s body, A. Mahady et al."

Performers recline in their seats to show as much of their bodies as \npossible or lean forward to accentuate bared cleavage. S-ASMRtist’s clothing often harkens to anime culture (Galbraith, 2011), with \nsleeveless tops bearing cleavage and short skirts that expose legs. \nS-ASMR content also lacks auditory elements common to ASMR. Starr et al. (2020) found a lack of tapping, whispering, slow hand \nmovements and soft speaking. Much more common were mouth sounds such as kissing, eating and breathing. As established, these \nsounds are divisive in the ASMR community, and seemingly serve to imply oral sex more than to induce a tingling sensation (Starr \net al., 2020). Licking sounds are often paired with exaggerated facial expressions evocative of ahegao, an expression found in Japanese \nanime pornography, hentai, showing intense pleasure. These characteristics are present in the most popular ASMR twitch streamers \ntoday, such as Amaranth, who won ‘Best ASMR Streamer’ award for her popular ASMR Streams in 2021 (The Streamer Awards, 2022). \nThe existence of this S-ASMR content misrepresents what conventional ASMR involves and threatens to delegitimise it. Thus, a more \nformal definition and understanding of ASMR is needed. Ultimately, ASMR content offers a versatile performance medium which can \nbe utilised for a variety of genres, ranging from clinical roleplays, relaxation videos, to intimate and sexual content, when adopted \nappropriately. It is important to demarcate between therapeutically-beneficial ASMR and material that appears to use (limited) ele-\nments of ASMR for the explicit sensationalisation or sextualisation of content. \nAs scholars have observed with emergent integrative praxis in the fields of virtual reality assisted psychotherapy, telehealth, and \nother burgeoning platforms that cultivate the strengths of modern telecommunications, ASMR is well-placed as a versatile, short-form, \nand anecdotally effective model that may either complement or supplement certain psychotherapeutic modalities. For instance, \nroleplay/personal attention/intimate ASMR has promising potential to aid clients struggling with intimacy, or for couples therapy. The \nfeelings of connectedness strengthened during ASMR may counter the negative effects of loneliness and improve well-being (Holt- \nLunstad et al., 2015; Poerio et al., 2018). Finally, the medium also has potential in non-related legitimate disciplines of practice, such \nas marketing, advertising, and teaching (Bogueva & Marinova, 2020; Chae et al., 2021; Spence, 2020). \n9.The role of expectancy, placebo, and context \nBecause there has been little progress in clinical trials on the impact of ASMR, there is scepticism surrounding its validity (Brand, \n2015; Cash et al., 2018). If ASMR experiences and frisson experiences are indeed the result of predominantly expectancy effects, or \nplacebo, the validity of ASMR as a potentially therapeutically beneficial medium is diminished. Cash et al. (2018) conducted a study on \nASMR users and non-ASMR users to determine if ASMR was elicited because of expectation. Participants were shown 3 types of clips: 1) \nASMR-inducing content, denoted ‘ASMR’, 2) content that exhibited a passing similarity to ASMR, but lacked core characteristics, thus, \nshould not induce ASMR, denoted ‘foil’, 3) a control clip of technological music, denoted ‘music’. Prior to viewing, participants \nreceived instructions that aimed to skew their expectations: One group had instructions that suggested all the clips would induce ASMR \n(encouraging), while the other group’s instructions suggested none of the clips would induce ASMR (discouraging). \nThe findings showed that non-ASMR users were susceptible to expectancy effects, but ASMR users were not (Cash et al., 2018). \nASMR ratings did not significantly differ between encouraging and discouraging groups for ASMR users. ASMR users also reported \nsignificantly higher ASMR ratings for the ASMR clips than the music and foil clips. In ASMR sensitive individuals, ASMR clips induced \nASMR regardless of the priming that was provided. Cash et al. (2018) interpreted these results by suggesting that ASMR is indeed the \nresult of expectancy effects and is such for both naïve participants and ASMR users. They suggest that ASMR users were unaffected by \nthe experimental manipulation because their personal expectations overrode the experimental expectations. They argue these personal \nexpectations are evident in the uniquely low scores ASMR users reported for the music and foil clips, which were lower than the non- \nASMR users. As Hostler et al. (2019) identify in their commentary on Cash et al.’s (2018) study, this is not a parsimonious explanation. \nThe consistently low scores that ASMR users rated the foil and music clips cannot explain how high ASMR scores were caused by pre- \nexisting expectation. \nWhile it may be the case that ASMR users had predisposed schemas regarding what ASMR videos entail, this was not addressed in \nthe study design, and thus such a conclusion is speculative. The expectancy manipulation—telling participants the media will or will \nnot induce ASMR—is a poor test of the expectancy hypothesis, as this is unlikely to change the expectations of individuals who are \nalready familiar with ASMR. This presents a difficulty with designing placebo studies on ASMR. Frequent users of ASMR are likely to \nhave ASMR schemas, whereas those who are unfamiliar will not. Future studies could consider performing a similar study design on \nonly naïve participants, which would remove the influence of ASMR schemas. As Hostler et al. (2019) note, this would require a \nthorough explanation of ASMR to these participants, to ensure they have the ‘perceptual expertise’ to understand and identify ASMR, \nand not conflate ASMR with other sensations such as frisson. A truly naïve viewing of ASMR would likely yield meaningless results, as \nparticipants would not understand what ASMR is or how it is induced. Hostler et al., (2019) instead argue that Cash et al.’s (2018) \nexperiment speaks to the veracity of ASMR, because ASMR users consistently reported high ASMR induction from the ASMR clips, \nregardless of the experimental manipulation. However, this does not explain why naïve participants were influenced by the expectancy \nmanipulations. \nCertainly, when analysing the impact of digital mediums such as ASMR videos, the role of placebo is highly intwined in the \nexperience. Ahuja and Ahuja (2019) argue that is it an impossible task to untangle ASMR from placebo. They point to definitions of \nplacebo that describe positive health outcomes from the “identifiable healthcare paraphernalia and settings, emotional and cognitive \nengagement with clinicians, empathetic and intimate witnessing, and the laying on the hands”, which lacks any medicinal inter-\nvention. They argue that ASMR videos, specifically medical-based roleplay videos (faux doctor visits, eye exams), inherently have \nthese characteristics of a placebo. That is, the simulation of medical settings that exists in ASMR roleplay videos aims to reap the \nbenefits of the medical encounter without the clinical substance. They contest that study designs that aim to create control videos, that A. Mahady et al."

Ahuja and Ahuja’s (2019) ar-\nguments relate specifically to ASMR videos that involve a medical roleplay, not to the broader concept of ASMR media. Numerous \nstudies have aimed to tease apart the aesthetic and auditory qualities of ASMR videos (Daniels, 2022; Gallagher, 2016; Kovacevich & \nHuron, 2019; Vucic, 2020), and the specific triggers that commonly induce ASMR. To create a ASMR ‘foil’ for an experimental study, \nthese aesthetic qualities could be adopted, whilst lacking specific ASMR triggers or the audio qualities, such as oral wetness, audio \nroaming, and low syllabic rate (Kovacevich & Huron, 2019). The question remains whether simulating an ASMR video simply leads to \nthe creation of an ASMR video: A simulation of ASMR could still induce ASMR. \nA possible solution could be the use of unintentional ASMR, a genre of ASMR video which takes scenes from television, films, and \nreal-life recordings such as medical exams or painting tutorials that possess characteristics of ASMR. These videos are not expressly \nASMR, though the characteristics (quiet speaking, proximity, close personal attention) still induce ASMR to some viewers. Uninten -\ntional ASMR could be used in addition to control and ‘foil’ videos in an experimental study design. These videos may be more sus-\nceptible to expectancy manipulations because they are not intended to be ASMR and would not align with some ASMR schemas. This \ncould aid in determining if some ASMR users are more influenced by expectancy effects than others. \nThe discussion of placebo in ASMR is highly complex and involves numerous factors such as schemas, context, personal preference, \nsubject bias, and the difficulty in producing ‘foil’ ASMR. Some studies have yielded positive results with open label placebo trials \n(Kaptchuk et al., 2010) – suggesting that the influence of placebo on clinical interventions should not be viewed as a detriment to \neffectiveness. It is likely that ASMR is impacted by expectancy and placebo in a similar way to many established medical interventions. \nCommon interventions such as SSRIs are known to be effective in part due to placebo (Kirsch, 2014, 2019). Further research is \nnecessary to determine what role placebo and expectancy plays in ASMR. We assert that ASMR is a physiologically effecting phe-\nnomenon with neurological underpinnings, that is augmented by factors such as placebo and expectancy. \n9.1. Context \nWhile Cash et al. (2018) were unable to parsimoniously prove that ASMR users had pre-existing expectations, this consideration \nshould not be objected outright: There is merit to the idea that how individuals interpret external stimuli, specifically sounds, can be \ninfluenced by their expectations and conceptual understanding. Research on the restorative power of natural sounds, such as rain, \nchirping birds and rustling wind, is well documented (Benfield, et al., 2010; Benfield et al., 2014; Benfield et al., 2014; Ulrich, 1981, \n1984; Ulrich et al., 1991; See Biophilia; Fromm, 1964), however some evidence suggests these benefits are impacted by expectancy. \nVan Hedger et al. (2019) observed that nature sounds were only preferred over urban sounds if they were easily associated with nature. \nAmbiguous nature sounds, on the other hand, were less favourable than urban sounds. Another study found ambiguous sounds were \nrated higher if participants were told these originated from a waterfall, as opposed to a machine (Haga et al., 2016). This suggests that a \nsemantic judgement is involved in the interpretation of these sounds, contrary to popular belief that humans’ affinity for natural \nsounds is innate (see Stress Reduction Theory; Ulrich, 1983). A similar case may exist with ASMR, wherein the triggers that are \nintentionally produced in an ASMR video are judged differently than similar sounds that occur naturalistically in real life. A classic \nexample of this is chewing or mouth sounds, such as lip smacking, loud swallowing or heavy breathing, which are relaxing when \nobserved in an ASMR video, but misophonic when heard in real life. \nKnowledge that the triggers are being produced intentionally from a video, as opposed to naturally in real life, may change one’s \ninterpretation. Similar instances of contextual information changing aesthetic judgement exist in music and visual art, such as un-\npleasant sounds being perceived positively in the context of contemporary music (Reuter & Oehler, 2011), or a painting gaining \npoignancy upon learning about the artist’s circumstances at the time (Berger et al., 1972). Alternatively, the lack of control that a \nlistener possesses when a trigger occurs naturalistically may result in frustration or discomfort. When an ASMR video is experienced, \nthe type of triggers and the volume is decided by the viewer, thus a level of control and active participation is maintained, which may \naid the induction of ASMR tingles. Additionally, findings suggest that loud environments such as bars are not conducive to experi -\nencing ASMR, supporting the concept that context is an important factor (Barratt et al., 2017). Such contexts may preclude the ability \nto enter a state of immersion and focused attention which aids ASMR induction (Janik McErlean & Osborne-Ford, 2020). \nThe role of context could be explained by McGeoch and Rouw’s (2020; see Section 6.1) theory that cross activations between the \nauditory cortex and the insula cause an intense emotional moment. Perhaps context influences whether the global emotional moment \nis perceived positively (ASMR) or negatively (misophonia). Potentially too, a state of mind akin to flow, immersion, or focused \nattention, may act as a precursor that allows cross activations to be interpreted positively, thus inducing ASMR rather than miso-\nphonia. This could explain why stimuli occurring in naturalistic contexts cause misophonia, where a state of flow is non-existent, but \nthe same stimuli can induce ASMR when an individual is immersed in an ASMR video. \nFurthermore, a positive correlation between preference for natural scenes and the perceived benefit of that environment has been \nobserved. That is, those who think nature is restorative tend to enjoy it more (Purcell et al., 2001). This suggests that there is an \nelement of expectation when interpreting sounds that are typically considered to be calming or restorative. This may too be the case \nwith ASMR videos, which are typically interpreted as a therapeutic by regular listeners. These factors may also play into a sense of \nwillingness to experience the sensation, as one may not experience ASMR tingles if they are not engaged or invested in the video and its \npotentially positive outcomes. \n10.ASMR criteria \nHaving applied Roberts et al.’s (2019) insights that they applied to derive an ASMR-15 scale, we consider the following features A.

It often occurs around \nthe spine but has been reported in other areas (Barratt & Davis, 2015; Roberts et al., 2019 ). Secondly, altered consciousness, which \ncaptures the propensity to deviate from regular waking function when experiencing ASMR, including shifts in awareness and \nperception such as time distortion (Roberts et al., 2019 ). Studies have indicated this is likely a flow state, although such a state may \nvary between individuals, potentially being more like a mindfulness state; as mentioned earlier, a combination of different states might \ncome about. Next, a marked presence of relaxation and change in affect (positive feelings). ASMR characteristically results in positive \nfeelings (Ahuja, 2013 ), whether a sense of calm, satisfaction, aesthetic pleasure, or engagement. Without these positive feelings, ASMR \nmay be miscategorised as a form of paraesthesia. \nAlthough no scientific research has been conducted as of writing, we believe context and willingness is key in experiencing ASMR. \nSurvey research has indicated individuals are less likely to experience ASMR in noisy or stressful environments (Barratt et al., 2017 ), \nwhich may impact the ability to enter an altered state of consciousness demarcated by focused attention and immersion (see Ap-\npendix 1). Additionally, the common discourse within the ASMR community that some triggers, such as mouth sounds, can be relaxing \nin the context of an ASMR video, but misophonic in other contexts indicates that context influences ASMR induction. Drawing from \nfindings on ambigious nature sounds (Purcell et al., 2001; Van Hedger et al., 2019 ), we assert that predisposed beliefs influence how \nindividuals experience external stimuli, and thus how ASMR is induced. The willingness to experience ASMR and the belief in its \nveracity may also influence how affective and effective it is for individuals. \n\u0000·\u0000·\u0000×\u0000⇔\u0000∓\u0000÷\u0000⊘\u0000≤\u0000⊗\u0000≼\u0000⊙\u0000∓\u0000÷\u0000©\nASMR represents a unique sensory experience that entails a blend of arousal, relaxation, alertness and emotional connection, which \ncan produce positive feelings, increases in alpha brain activity, reduced heart rate, increased skin conductance and pupil dilation \n(Barratt & Davis, 2015; Engelbregt et al., 2022; Fredborg et al., 2021 ; Poerio et al., 2018; Valtakari, 2019 ). Those who experience the \nsensation tend to have reduced functional connectivity within resting state networks, suggesting less compartmentalisation within the \nbrain. This may result in cross activations between typically disconnected brain regions (Smith et al., 2019b ). Theories posit that the \npleasant sensation and positive feelings associated with ASMR may result from a cross-activation between the auditory cortex and the \nautonomous nervous system, producing a positively valanced homeostatic reaction (McGeoch & Rouw, 2020 ). \nWhile ASMR is broadly considered a relaxing phenomenon, research indicates it is a more complex and engaging sensation, \ninvolving emotional compartments of the brain, and engaging brain regions associated with arousal as well as relaxation. That unique \ncombination of factors illustrates that ASMR involves a level of focused attention, sympathetic activation, and emotional connect -\nedness not found in a typical relaxation response. The core aspects involved in an ASMR response have been extensively canvassed \nhere, and avenues for future research have been put forth, especially the role of context in experiencing ASMR and/or interrelated \nsensory phenomena. Future research may also examine the release of social grooming neuropeptides during ASMR. ASMR content as \nperformance medium shows promise in a therapeutic setting, with potential use for building emotional connection, loneliness \ntreatment, and couples ’ therapy. Considering this early work, it would be interesting for the academic community to validate ASMR as \na scientifically based sensation with a broad range of potential implications in psychotherapy and social cognition. \n\u0000•\u0000≡\u0000⊘\u0000≤\u0000⊇\u0000±\u0000⊇\u0000⋄\u0000⊙\u0000∓\u0000÷\u0000©\u0000∓\u0000≥\u0000©\u0000⇔\u0000∓\u0000∝\u0000≺\u0000≡\u0000⋄\u0000⊙\u0000÷\u0000→\u0000©\u0000∗\u0000÷\u0000⋄\u0000≡\u0000±\u0000≡\u0000≼\u0000⋄\u0000©\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to \ninfluence the work reported in this paper. \n\u0000•\u0000⊇\u0000⋄\u0000⊇\u0000©\u0000⊇\u0000↔\u0000⊇\u0000⊙\u0000≤\u0000⊇\u0000⇒\u0000⊙\u0000≤\u0000⊙\u0000⋄\u0000≃\u0000©\nThere is no direct/original data used in this theoretical work \n\u0000≈\u0000≺\u0000≺\u0000≡\u0000÷\u0000⊖\u0000⊙\u0000∞\u0000©\nComments Regarding the Importance of Context in ASMR. \nDiya (2021) .
