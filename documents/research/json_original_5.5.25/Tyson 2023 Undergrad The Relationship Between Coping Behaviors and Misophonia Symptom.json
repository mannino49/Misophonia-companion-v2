Individuals with misophonia may engage in anxiety -driven coping behaviors that \nconstitute avoidance and safety behaviors. Current literature shows that while coping \nbehavior may offer temporary relief of anxiety and distress, they can lead to persisting \nanxiety and avoidance of experiences.  Given preliminary evidence demonstrating a link \nbetween coping behaviors and maintained or wor sening symptoms, additional research is \nwarranted to further understand the role of coping behaviors in misophonia . However, \nfew studies have investigated the relationship between coping behaviors and maintenance \nor worsening of misophonia symptom severity  and related  impairment. As such, t he aims \nof the current study were to 1) examine the correlation between the use of  coping \nbehaviors deployed before, during, and after misophonia triggers on misophonia \nsymptom severity and impairment and 2) investigate t he mediating role of coping \nbehaviors on trigger count and misophonia symptom severity. The sample included 62 \ncommunity members ( M = 28.6 years ; 82.1% female; 79.1% White) who  screened \npositive for misophonia. Participants completed self -report questionnaires. Bivariate \ncorrelations indicated that c oping behaviors (before, during, and after  misophonia \ntrigger s) were significantly correlated with misophonia symptom severity and \nimpairmen t, supporting our hypotheses . Counter to prediction, the  total frequency of \ncoping behaviors was not a significant mediator of trigger count and misophonia \nsymptom severity. The findings indicate that future research should consider exposure"

      "text": "1 \n \nIntroduction  \nMisophonia, also known as selective sound sensitivity, is a complex neurophysiological \ncondition in which individuals experience strong aversive reactions (e.g., anxiety, disgu st, anger) \nto specific sound triggers ( Brout  et al., 2018; Cavanna & Seri, 2015). Common trigger sounds \ninclude chewing, crunching of foods, throat clearing, pen clicking, and slurping ( Taylor, 2017 ). \nMisophonia is a devastating disorder, significantly impairing individuals as they experience a \nstrong disliking of sounds  and increased emotional responses to trigger sounds (Kumar et al., \n2017; Swedo et al., 2021). Tolerance duration, defined as the length of time they can tolerate \nvarious tr igger sounds without having a response depending on the type of sound, and overall \nsymptom severity var ies in this population ( Brout  et al., 2018; Vanaja & Abigail , \n2020).  Misophonia was first identified in the early 2000s; however, research investigating its \nprevalence, comorbidity, and possible etiological factors has advanced  in recent years (Palumbo \net al., 2018). Prevalence rates f or misophonia have been found to vary between populations, with \nestimates ranging from 12.8 -20% (Kiliç  et al., 2021; Potgie ter et al., 2019). On average, \nsymptoms develop for individuals around twelve years of age and are known to worsen over \ntime ( Kumar et al., 2017 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ).  \nThere is a range of misophonia symptoms, including audiologic, physiological , and \npsychological symptoms. Kumar et al., (2017) observed that trigger sounds were connected to \nhyperactivity in the anterior insular cortex for individuals with misophonia compared to control \ngroups. Subjective experiences of physiological arousal include increases in perceived pressure"

Physiological reactions occur in other \naspects of the body as well,  including higher heart rates and skin conductance responses when \nhearing a misophonic trigger, but not when hearing an unpleasant stimulus ( Brout  et al., 2018; \nKumar et al., 2017). Individuals with misophonia additionally tend to experience a range of \nemotional responses to triggers including anger, disgust, and anxiety ( Brout  et al., \n2018).  Although there is not yet a formal diagnostic  classification for misophonia (Vanaja & \nAbigail , 2020),  many researchers have drawn parallels between misophonia and psyc hological \ndisorders, and in particular, anxiety disorders ( Taylor, 2017 ).  \nOne key similarity between misophonia and anxiety disorders is the engagement in \nanxiety -driven coping behaviors, which may also be described as avoidance and safety \nbehaviors, in r esponse to the intense emotional reactivity to trigger sounds (Cowan et al., 2022). \nThese behaviors may be performed overtly (i.e., in a way that is observable to others, such as \nwearing headphones) or covertly (e.g., attempting to ignore the sound) (Ball & Gunaydin, 2022; \nCowan et al., 2022; Rachman et al., 2008; Thwaites & Freeston, 2005). Current cognitive -\nbehavioral models of anxiety and related disorders posit that coping behaviors offer temporary \nrelief of anxiety and distress by facilitating escape o r distraction from perceived threat; however, \nthey can lead to persisting anxiety and avoidance of experiences (Rachman et al., 2008). In the \nlong-term, previously adaptive coping behaviors become increasingly maladaptive when the \nsituation is perceived as  threatening but poses no actual danger and the individual consistently \navoids it (Ball & Gunaydin, 2022; Thwaites & Freeston, 2005).  For instance, an individual with"

Avoidance -based coping behaviors (including safety \nbehaviors) maintain anxiety symptoms because individuals inadvertently forgo opportunities to \nlearn that situations or experiences, although perceived as th reatening, are safe and that distress \ncan be tolerated (Ball & Gunaydin, 2022). Consequently, the individual continues to experience \ndistress and impairment through associative and non -associative mechanisms.  Associative \nlearning through classical conditio ning strengthens an individual’s misophonia (Palumbo et al., \n2018). Non-associative learning results in habituation or sensitization; sensitization means \nincreased activity in response to a misophonic stimulus (Palumbo et al., 2018). Misophonic \nreactions a re posited to be a  conditioned learning response to aversive, trigger stimuli (Dozier, \n2015). Individuals with misophonia report that their reactions to trigger sounds are involuntary , \nsuggesting that it is a  conditioned reflex or a sensitized response to hearing aversive stimuli \n(Dozier, 2015; Palumbo et al., 2018). Continued use of coping behaviors strengthen s both the \nassociative learning and non -associative learning mechanisms of misophonia (Palumbo et al., \n2018). \nCoping behavior s related to misophonia appear to present and function similarly to those \ncommon for concerns, such as anxiety disorders. Existing literature reveals that individuals \nengage in coping behaviors that are conceptually related to the threat, meaning the anxie ty \ncomplaint and perceived threat typically encourage individuals to engage in a coping behavior \nthat addresses the specific threat (Telch & Lancaster , 2012). In misophonia, this often means that \nindividuals engage in coping behaviors that are directly rel ated to the misophonic trigger. For"

Coping  behaviors are used before hearing a trigger sound to avoid  \nhearing the sound ( e.g., distraction, using a different sound; Dozier & Mitchell , 2022 ). Typically, \nan individual experiences anticipatory anxiety related to trigger sounds and responds with \navoidance behaviors (Dozier , 2015).  Coping behaviors used during hearing a trigger sound are \nused to help relieve the intense emotional reactions ( e.g., covering ears, cognitive restructuring; \nDozier & Mitchell , 2022 ). Copi ng behaviors used after hearing a trigger sound focus on reducing \nemotional distress, while performing a mental review of the sound, enforcing learning that the \nsound is intolerable ( e.g., relaxation exercises, doing something comforting; Dozier & Mitchell , \n2022 ). Avoiding trigger sounds is associated with higher levels of distress and anger in \nindividuals with misophonia (Cowan et al., 2022). Social isolation can occur when individuals \ncommonly avoid situations and others due to the possibility of hearing misophonic triggers \n(Cowan et al., 2022).  Despite when an individual engages in a coping behavior, literature shows \nthat these behaviors  perpetuate misophonia symptom severity and impairment ( Dozier & \nMitchell , 2022 ).  \nOne important direction for  the expan sion of this research is the examination of the \nconnection s between the utilization of coping behaviors and misophonia symptom severity  and"

Given preliminary evidence demonstrating a link between coping behaviors and \nmaintained or worsening sym ptoms (Rachman et al., 2008), additional research is warranted to \nfurther extrapolate the role of these  behaviors in misophonia.  This study addresses several \nlimitations in the current literature , specifically the limited understanding o f the maintenance of \nmisophonia. This is significant to identify more effective treatments as research on interventions \nis underdeveloped . This study accomplishes this by examining the significance of the temporal \nincidence of when individuals utilize copin g behaviors related to misophonic triggers. We \nbelieve that the temporal incidence of coping behaviors will be significant because coping before \ncommonly prevents an individual from interacting with aversive stimuli, while coping during \nand coping after mo re commonly correspond with the emotional reactions of hearing the sound \n(Ball & Gunaydin, 2022). Given the limited research on misophonia , the first aim sought to \ndescribe the triggers, emotions, coping behaviors, and impairment of misophonia. The second \naim was to explore associations between the timing of the utilization of coping behaviors, \nsymptom severity, and impairment related to misophonia.

The A -MISO -S assesses how much time an individual spends \npreoccupied with sounds, interference with daily activities, distress associated with trigger \nsounds, effort spent resisting thinking  about the sounds, control over thoughts about sounds, and \navoidance of the stimuli (Naylor et al., 2020). Individuals rate questionnaire statements using a \n5-point Likert -type scale ranging from 0 to 4. For example, the question “Have you been \navoiding do ing anything, going any place, or being with anyone because of your misophonia,” \nwith the possible responses “no deliberate avoidance, minimal avoidance, some avoidance, much \navoidance, or very extensive avoidance.”  Scores are totaled and range from sub -clinical [0 -4], \nmild [5 -9], moderate [10 -14], severe [15 -19], and extreme [20 -24].

Thus, the purpose of the \npresent study was to examine temporal engagement in  coping behaviors, a factor known to affect \nanxiety  and thought to similarly influence misophonia  symptom severity and impairment \n(Thwaites & Freeston , 2005) , among individuals with misophonia . Examining the role of coping \nbehaviors in relation to misophonia symptom severity and impairment may inform the \nidentification of potential treatment plans for misophonia. Understanding these relationships will \nbe critical for treatment, as it is essential to educate the patient on the effect of their use of coping \nbehaviors on their misophonia symptom severity and impairment (Frank & McKay, 2019).  This \ninformation is of particular importance for future healthcare providers to consider regarding \nmisophonia treatment given the prevalence of misophonia, estimated at 12.8 -20% ( Kiliç  et al., \n2021; Potgieter  et al., 2019). Additionally, the present study adds to the limited literature \npertaining  to coping behaviors and misophonia symptom severity and impairment by \ninvestigating the correlations between subscales of coping behaviors.  \nWith regard to  impairment, participants in this study ranged from slightly to definitely \nimpaired in regard to social leisure activities and maintaining close relationships. Wu et al. \n(2014) found that  in individuals who met the clinical cutoff for misophonia, around ha lf of the \nparticipants experience d moderate or high levels of functional impairment in school and work \nfunction, and around 20% experienced moderate or high levels of social and family functional \nimpairment. Previous literature shows that clinically signif icant misophonia severity is correlated"

This is consistent with our research, as a strong positive correlation  was found \nbetween misophonia sympt om severity and impairment. This finding is significant because it \ncontinues to show that misophonia symptom severity is related to impairment in all aspects of \nlife. Although these measures generally assess the same functional impairment constructs, direct \ncomparisons of clinical scores  should be interpreted with caution as there is variability in the \nmeasures. Examining specific factors that could influence the relationship between misophonia \nsymptom severity and impairment is crucial, as misophonia s ymptoms commonly interfere with \ndaily activities (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder  et al., 2013 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). \nOur results are consistent with previous literature that eating sounds, smacking, pen \nclicking, and clock ticking were the worst trigger soun ds (Edelstein et al., 2013). However, there \nis a specificity in trigger sounds from person to person (Edelstein et al., 2020). Trigger sounds \nare traditionally background noise s for most individuals , but individuals with misophonia  suffer \nfrom a hyper -fixation  on these sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013). The significance placed on these \nsounds leads to concentration issues in academic and occupational settings (Swedo et al., 2021). \nInability to finish tasks and perform well is common w ith misophonia  sufferers who are \ncommonly around misophonic triggers (Swedo et al., 2021). On the DMQ, the most common \nemotional reactions upon hearing a bothersome sound were feeling frustrated , anxious , and \njittery. This  result  is consistent with previou s literature , which has found irritation is experienced \nin over half of the participant sample upon hearing a trigger sound ( Schröder  et al., 2013). In a \nprevious study , individuals  were found to endorse  anxiety or stress about a trigger but  were not"

In this study , the most commonly reported \nphysiological reaction was becoming rigid or stiff when intensely both ered by a sound. This \nresult is consistent with previous research about the physiological reactions of misophonia \n(Edelstein et al., 2013).  Misophonia can severely impair an individual’s life due to these \npsychological and physiological symptoms (Edelstein et al., 2020).  \nWith regard to the most common coping behaviors, individuals endorsed using different \nsounds to drown out bothersome sounds , block the sound, and focus their attention on an \nactivity. The utilization of these coping behaviors is consistent with previous research about the \ntypes of coping behaviors individuals with misophonia use to deal with trigger sounds (Edelstein \net al., 2 013; Cowan et al., 2022). Edelstein et al. (2013) found that individuals avoid certain \nsituations where the sound might be present, try to “cancel out” the sound, or use earplugs or \nmusic to cover bothersome sounds.  \nConsistent with our hypotheses, engagin g in coping behaviors before, during, and after \nhearing a misophonia trigger w as significantly correlated with higher symptom severity and \nworse impairment. The  correlation between coping before hearing a misophonic trigger and \nimpairment suggests a relati onship between coping before and impairment, which could further \nsupport the idea that coping is a maintaining factor for misophonia as well as other disorders.  \nOut of the three coping subscales, coping  prior to encountering misophonia triggers was  the most \nstrongly correlated to impairment and misophonia symptom severity .

Coping behavi ors negatively reinforce anxiety related to a stimulus because \nthere is a temporary reduction in aversive feelings . However , this conditions the individual to \nmaintain their coping mechanisms, in turn maintaining their anxiety (Pittig et al., 2018; Telch &  \nLancaster, 2012). This pattern  is reflected in our data through the strong positive correlation \nbetween coping before hearing a misophonic trigger and symptom severity and impairment. This \nis consistent with pre vious research. Specifically, i ndividuals wi th misophonia perceive  trigger \nsounds with an increased attention or obsession, which may amplif y the negative reaction and \nperception of the sound ( Vanaja & Abigail , 2020). Responses are typically learned specifically to \none individual, then become generalized to any situation where the sound is made (Dozier , \n2015). Fear generalization occurs when an individual gradually begins to generalize a neutral \nstimulus categor ically related to the feared or unpleasant stimulus, increasing anxiety and \navoidance ( Christian & Levinson, 2022 ). Generalization sustains and heightens anxiety and \navoidance related to conditioned stimuli (Christian & Levinson, 2022).  \nOur hypothesis tha t coping would mediate the association between trigger count and \nsymptom severity was not supported by the current  analyses. In the mediation model, the total \neffect model was significant. Both trigger sounds and the total frequency of coping behaviors are \npredictors for misophonia symptom severity . However,  there was no  indirect effect of the \nnumber of trigger sounds on symptom severity through average frequency of all coping"

The absence of findings may be explained by potential \nissues with the method of measurement for the trigger sounds and coping variables. Specifically , \nthe average frequency of all coping behaviors may be an underestimate  as the average considers \nresponses across all coping behaviors; therefore,  an individual who only uses one coping \nbehavior  (albeit constantly) would have a fairly low  score. Therefore, this item considers the \nvariability and frequency  of engagement in coping behaviors, rather than total engagement in \ncoping behaviors. A more accurate assessment of coping may be time spent engaging in coping \nbehaviors.  Secondly, the absence of findings may be explained by potential issues with the \nmetho d of measurement for total trigger count. Specifically, the sum total count of trigger sounds \nmay be an underestimate, because an individual may have one distressing sound they are \nexposed to constantl y; therefore, an individual who experiences high levels  of distress from only \none sound would have a fairly low score. Our measures simplify the experience that an \nindividual has. Future research should consider examining time spent exposed to one sound or \nwhich sounds are most distressing to the individual.

In the future, longitudinal or experimental studies may be able to \nhelp experimenters to infer the dir ectionality of  behaviors . That is, does greater reliance on  \ncoping behavior s worsen misophonia symptom severity  or do individuals with worse misophonia \nsymptoms initiate a greater number of coping behaviors over time.  A third limitation is that the \nsample primarily included female ( 82.1%) and white ( 79.1%) participants, which limits the \nscope of understanding how coping behaviors are correlated to misophonia symptom severity \nand impairment among individuals with diverse demographics. Although women represent the \nmajority of misophonia cases in prior studies ( Potgieter  et al., 2021), future research including a \nmore demographically diverse sample would improve the generalizability of the findings. \nHowever, this can be a limitation because these sample s could also be biased, or men might not \nbe presenting themselves for treatment. Lastly, this investigation uses measures with \npredetermined lists of triggers. Future research should explore the role of all possible triggers to \nidentify and evaluate how tr iggers truly affect misophonia symptom severity and impairment. \nThe limited nature of research on misophonia limits what is known about different presentations \nof misophonia . For example, it is unknown if it is more common for an individual to endorse two \ntriggers or ten . This information  is crucial for potential treatment because an individual may be \nexposed to one severely distressing sound constantly and experience high levels of impairment, \nor someone may be exposed to ten mildly distressing sounds and only experience mild functional \nimpairment. Future research must investigate the differences in presentations due to trigger count \nto develop effective treatment."

Research \ninvestigating the impact of trigger count, intensity, and coping strategi es on symptom severity is \nnovel and new. Additional research is needed to fully understand the relationship between trigger \ncount, coping, and misophonia symptom severity and impairment.  Using this information, \nresearchers may find direction for appropriate treatment options for individuals with misophonia , \nas distress reduction will be crucial for treatment (Frank & McKay, 2019) . Research on effective \ntreatment for anxiety and fear disorders reveals that exposure therapy and reducing avoidance -\nrelated coping behaviors is the most effective treatment for a reduction of symptoms ( Hofmann \n& Hay, 2018 ). Avoidance is reinforced as there is a temporary reduction in aversive symptoms,  \nhowever, the individual is never learning to deal with the stimuli (Ho fmann & Hay, 2018). For \nmisophonia, this looks like an individual engaging in coping behaviors (e.g., blocking trigger \nsound, mimicking trigger, avoiding situation where sound may be present), which leads to \nmaintenance of symptoms and impairment. Educatin g patients on the correlation between coping \nbehaviors and learning will be important as engaging with trigger sounds could be a way to \nreduce misophonia symptom severity and impairment."
