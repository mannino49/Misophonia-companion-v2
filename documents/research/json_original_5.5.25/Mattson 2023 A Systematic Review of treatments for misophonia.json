All rights reserved.A systematic review of treatments for misophonia \nSeth A. Mattson, Johann D’Souza, Katharine D. Wojcik, Andrew G. Guzick, Wayne K. Goodman, \nEric A. Storch* \nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, United States   \nARTICLE INFO  \nKeywords: \nMisophonia \nTreatment \nAssessment \nCognitive-behavioral therapy \nPharmacotherapy ABSTRACT  \nResearch into misophonia treatments has been limited and it is unclear what treatment approaches may be \neffective. This systematic review extracted and synthesized relevant treatment research on misophonia to \nexamine the efficacy of various intervention modalities and identify current trends in order to guide future \ntreatment research. PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central were searched using the keywords \n“misophonia, ” “decreased sound tolerance, ” “selective sound sensitivity, ” or “decreased sound sensitivity. ” Of the \n169 records available for initial screening, 33 studied misophonia treatment specifically. Data were available for \none randomized controlled trial, one open label trial, and 31 case studies. Treatments included various forms of \npsychotherapy, medication, and combinations of the two. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) incorporating \nvarious components has been the most often utilized and effective treatment for reduction of misophonia \nsymptoms in one randomized trial and several case studies/series. Beyond CBT, various case studies suggested \npossible benefit from other treatment approaches depending on the patient ’s symptom profile, although meth -\nodological rigor was limited. Given the limitations in the literature to date, including overall lack of rigor, lack of \ncomparative studies, limited replication, and small sample size, the field would benefit from the development of \nmechanism-informed treatments, rigorous randomized trials, and treatment development with an eye towards \ndissemination and implementation.   \n1.Introduction \nMisophonia is an impairing condition, generally presenting in \nchildhood or early adolescence, characterized by a decreased tolerance \nto specific sounds or stimuli associated with these sounds, known as \n“triggers ” [50]. The term misophonia was originally coined in 2002 [24] \nwith the literature gradually expanding thereafter. These triggers elicit a \nrange of negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses, \noften leading to avoidance of triggers and significant functional \nimpairment [41,50] . Triggers are typically related to oral and nasal \nsounds produced by other people, such as chewing and breathing, but \ncan include a broad range of typically benign auditory stimuli, such as \ntapping or scratching [20,51] . Responses to triggers include agitation, \nanger, disgust, and/or anxiety, as well as a “fight-or-flight ” autonomic \nresponse [4,13,41] . Misophonia commonly presents with co-occurring \ndepression and anxiety disorders, and less commonly with OCD, Tour-\nette’s syndrome, ADHD, autism, panic disorder, personality disorders, \nand suicidality [6,30,45,55] . Regarding the underlying pathophysi -\nology, brain-body connectivity mechanisms have been proposed based on functional neuroimaging findings revealing increased activation of \nthe anterior insula in individuals with misophonia, as well as increased \nconnectivity between cortical sensory and orofacial motor processing \npathwaysCavanna and Seri [5,26;27] . \nTo date, variable treatment approaches for misophonia have been \nreported. With several notable exceptions, majority of the literature \nconsists of case reports implementing a range of psychotherapy tech-\nniques, and medications either in isolation or combination with psy-\nchotherapy [3,8,38,40,54,58] . Psychotherapeutic interventions include \nvarious forms of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Exposure Ther-\napy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior \nTherapy (DBT), and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing \n(EMDR). Medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibiters \n(SSRIs), stimulants, anti-psychotics, and β-Blockers. In addition, one \nrandomized controlled trial supported the efficacy of group CBT relative \nto a waitlist control with treatment components including task con-\ncentration, positive affect labeling, stimulus manipulation, and arousal \nreduction [21–22]. Due to the paucity of experimental trials, proto -\ncolized practice parameters for the treatment of misophonia remain \n*Corresponding author at: 1977 Butler Blvd, Suite 4-400, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, United States \nE-mail address: Eric.storch@bcm.edu (E.A.

Methodologically \nrigorous research on treatment interventions remains limited, and there \nhas not yet been a systematic review to synthesize data and overall ef-\nfects of extant treatments. This review extracts and synthesizes research \nfrom case series, case studies, open trials, and randomized-control trials \non the treatment of misophonia to examine the preliminary evidence for \nvarious treatment modalities and identify current data trends, which \nwill provide guidance for clinical practice and future research. \n2.Methods \nThis review is reported according to the PRISMA checklist extension \nfor scoping reviews [34]. First, the rationale and study objective were \ndefined. Next, the relevant studies were identified using a broad, \ncomprehensive approach to the literature. Studies were selected based \non pre-determined search parameters. The results were summarized, \nsynthesized, and reported. The findings were then reviewed by experts \nin the field. 2.1. Eligibility criteria (PICO) \nInclusion and exclusion criteria were formulated using the PICO \nframework. \nPopulation : We included records if they reported case or cohort \nstudies, case series, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs \nwhere the effectiveness of a treatment was documented and tested, \nand misophonia was the primary complaint/treatment target. All ages \nand comorbidities were included. Only studies published in English \nwere included. \nIntervention : We considered all treatment interventions if the pur-\npose of the study was to describe a patient or patients where the primary \nor secondary complaint was misophonia. Regardless of whether miso-\nphonia was the patient ’s primary or secondary concern, the treatment \nhad to specifically target misophonia symptoms. Examples of studies we \ndid not include were reviews, non-peer reviewed studies, editorials, \nmanuals, or guidelines. We did not include records without a full-text \ntranslation into English. \nComparison : Studies that did and did not include comparison \ntreatments were included. \nOutcome : To be included, studies had to have defined misophonia \nsymptom severity and either quantitative or qualitative reporting of \ntreatment outcomes. \nbefore \nscreening\nFig. 1.

Information sources and search strategy \nOn May 27th, 2022 we conducted a search of PubMed, PsycINFO, \nCochrane Central, and Google Scholar using the keywords “misopho -\nnia”, “decreased sound tolerance ”, “selective sound sensitivity ”, or \n“decreased sound sensitivity. ” Additionally, the reference section of \nrelevant sources was searched to locate other related sources that were \nnot found in the initial primary search. \n2.3. Study selection \nAll abstracts were assessed by an independent reviewer. Only records \naddressing misophonia treatment were included in the initial screen. \nThis was followed by a full text review, which was checked by a second \nreviewer to determine if eligibility criteria were met by all included \nstudies (See Fig. 1). Reviewers (3) included a clinical psychologist, a \npost-doctoral clinical psychology fellow, and a medical student under \nthe supervision of the last author. Discrepancies arose regarding the \ninclusion of studies where misophonia symptoms were not the direct \ntarget of therapy but included as a comorbidity. It was deemed these \nreports did not meet initial eligibility criteria, leading to a consensus \ndecision to exclude them. One exception to this was the study by Naguy \net al. (2022), which was deemed relevant because of the proposed \nmechanism by which the medication, targeting primary ASD symptoms, \nalso treated secondary misophonia symptoms. \n2.4. Outcomes and prioritization \nThe primary outcome was improvement on standardized misophonia \nseverity questionnaires, where the most commonly utilized measures \nincluded the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; [41], the upda -\nted Amsterdam Misophonia Scale-Revised (AMISOS-R; [42]), and the \nMisophonia Questionnaire [56]. The A-MISO-S and AMISOS-R, which \nwere modeled after the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scales \n[15,48] , are the most widely used measures in the misophonia literature \nto date. Psychometric properties have been reported including good \ninternal consistency, convergent and divergent validity and treatment \nsensitivity [22]. The Misophonia Questionnaire has demonstrated good \ninternal consistency, and convergent and divergent validity [56,59] . \nOther validated outcome measures used included the Clinical Global \nImpressions Improvement (CGI-I) Scale [17] and the Children ’s Global \nAssessment Scale (CGAS). Outcome measures that were less commonly \nused in the included studies are the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) \nscale [3], Navaco Anger Scale (NAS) [38], and the Misophonia Assess -\nment Questionnaire (MAQ) [9–11]. \n3.Results \nAfter removing duplicate records, 169 records were obtained for \ninitial screening. From these, 130 were excluded because they did not \nstudy misophonia treatment. Of the remaining 36 papers sought for full- \ntext review, 3 were excluded for various reasons (see Fig. 1) Of the 33 \nincluded reports, 1 was an RCT, 1 was an open label study, and 31 were \ncase studies/series. Of the 31 case studies/series, 15 were primarily CBT \ninterventions (9 of which included exposure-based techniques), 3 \ninvolved counter-conditioning alone, 1 was DBT, 1 was ACT, 1 was \nEMDR, 2 were TRT, 6 were primarily pharmacological interventions, \nand 2 reported a combination of both therapy and pharmacological in-\nterventions. The characteristics of included trials are shown in Table 1. \nAll interventions were given to individuals diagnosed with misophonia \nusing various clinical criteria, with most studies utilizing the A-MISO-S \n[41]. \nThe Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess risk of bias in \nincluded randomized control trials (Higgins & Green, 2011). The Jager \net al. [22] RCT has an overall low risk of bias based on criteria such as \nthe randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of \nreported results. \n3.1. Cognitive-Behavioral therapy \nAlthough results are both preliminary and heterogeneous, of all the \ntreatment approaches studied to date, cognitive-behavioral therapy \n(CBT) is the most consistently effective. The only randomized-controlled \ntrial published to date, by Jager and colleagues (2020), studied 54 adult \npatients randomized to either weekly group-based CBT or similar \nduration wait-list. CBT involved a closed group setting of 9 patients per \ngroup, and CBT components included exercises in task concentration, \npositive affect labeling, stimulus manipulation, and arousal reduction. \nStimulus manipulation involved counter-conditioning methods, a form \nof exposure that will be discussed in detail later. Therapists also pro-\nvided psychoeducation around eating norms to both the individuals and \ntheir families. After 3 months of weekly group therapy, patients showed \nan average decrease of 9.7 points on the AMISOS-R (95% CI, \u000012.0 to \n\u00007.4; p D.001, d 1.97), and 37% were rated as treatment responders \non the CGI-I. Effects were modest and maintained at 1-year follow-up, \nsuggesting short and long-term benefit for misophonia symptoms. The \nsame research group previously conducted an open label trial with a \nsimilar CBT approach. After 7–8 group CBT sessions, 90 total patients \nreported a mean reduction of 4.5 points on the A-MISO-S. Overall, \nnearly half of the patients experienced at least a 30% reduction on the A- \nMISO-S [43]. Lewin et al. [28] published a case series (N 4) from an \nongoing RCT examining the effect of a transdiagnostic CBT protocol \nknown as the Unified Protocol. Results indicate mild improvement, \nespecially in severe cases. \nCounter-conditioning, a common behavioral technique across case \nstudies, involves pairing a stimulus that evokes a specific behavior with \na behavior that is incompatible with it. Counter-conditioning for miso-\nphonia involves pairing a positive auditory stimulus (e.g., music) with \nthe negative (often reduced in intensity) conditioned stimulus (e.g., \nchewing) while inducing physiological relaxation incompatible with the \ntypical tension response evoked when encountering a trigger (e.g., \nthrough progressive muscle relaxation). It was first implemented for \nmisophonia by Dozier [11,9 –10] in a case series. Anecdotal improve -\nment was reported after anywhere from 7 to 23 treatment sessions of 30 \nmin each [9–11]. Subsequent studies, including the seminal study by \nJager and colleagues (2020), have implemented counter-conditioning \ncomponents in conjunction with other techniques [43,7] . \nCBT has been shown to be beneficial in multiple case studies, in both \nin-person [1,2,3,38] and virtual formats [57]. Of the patients in these \nstudies (n 7), all were young females ranging from 16 to 22 years old \nand the most common reaction was anger [1,2,3,38,57] . There was a \nwide range of symptom improvement, with one case improving from \nmoderate severity (11 on the A-MISO-S) to subclinical (4) severity [1] \nwhile another case showed improvement from extreme (23) to moderate \n(12) severity [1]. Of the CBT components utilized, Roushani and col-\nleagues (2021) implemented a similar model as described by Schneider \nand Arch [40]. Others utilized cognitive reappraisal components, \nbehavioral components to move from avoidance to healthy coping \nstrategies, and relaxation exercises [3]. \n3.2. CBT with exposure therapy \nCase studies have also examined CBT protocols that incorporate \nvarious exposure techniques. While some report treatment with co-\nmorbid OCD, all the exposures in these studies were directed towards \nmisophonia symptoms specifically. Cases were mostly young females \nalthough ages ranged widely across all studies (10–35 years). Further, \nsymptom profile as well as primary outcomes varied across the 13 pa-\ntient cases. In general, length of therapy was longer and more intense \ncompared with the studies of non-exposure-based CBT alone, ranging \nfrom 2 to as many as 23 total sessions [8,37] . Therapy was typically S.A. Mattson et al."

Exposure was defined variably among studies with some utilizing \ntraditional graded exposure [46], while others were grounded in newer \ninhibitory learning models of extinction learning [8]. For example, \nDover and McGuire [8] implemented 23 total sessions of a family-based \nCBT approach, with distinct phases of habit reversal training, parent \nmanagement training, and exposure therapy. This report showed a 70% \nreduction in misophonia symptoms. Family accommodation behaviors \nalso significantly decreased, suggesting some added benefit to a family- \nbased approach. \nTinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is a type of treatment aimed at \ndecreasing the strength of negative reactions through exposure to a \ncontinuous low-level broadband sound in which the patient has variable \nlevels of control over the environment, sounds used, and duration of \nsound exposure. Jastreboff and Jastreboff [23] report clinical \nimprovement in 86% of 201 total patients based on self-reported mea-\nsures of functional impairment. Misophonia symptom reduction (from \nsevere (17) to mild (6) based on the AMISOS-R) was also achieved \nthrough a combination of TRT, desensitization techniques, and habitu -\nation therapy (Vanaja and Abigail, 2020). \n3.3. “Third-Wave ” therapy approaches \nTwo case studies implemented “third wave ” behavioral approaches, \nincluding ACT and DBT. One case study described an adolescent female \nwith a primary response of intense rage who was unsuccessfully treated \nwith exposure-based CBT. While on paroxetine (25 mg) to treat anxiety, \nthe patient received DBT focusing on mindfulness and distress tolerance \nskills for 5 days a week during a 7-week partial hospitalization program. \nA-MISO-S scores reduced from extreme (22) to moderate (10) [25]. \nAnother third-wave case study implemented mindfulness and \nacceptance-based techniques to target high levels of anger and disgust in \na 17-year-old male patient [40]. Treatment also integrated DBT and CBT \ninterventions. After 10 sessions, severity ratings on the A-MISO-S scale \ndecreased by 50% from moderate (14) to minimal (7). \n3.4. Pharmacotherapy \nThe most widely reported medication class used to treat misophonia \nwas selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [39,53,58] . Three \ncase studies of variable demographics (one adolescent female, one adult \nfemale with comorbid OCD and one adult male with comorbid anxiety \nand depression) showed responses to SSRIs ranging from complete to \npartial remission of misophonia symptoms [39,53,58] . Sarigedik and \nYurteri [39] indicated a response time of one month on fluoxetine 20 mg \ndaily, and continued improvement with increased dose (30 mg) at 3 \nmonths. Zuschlag and Leventhal [58] reported remission of symptoms \nafter 3 weeks of sertraline 150 mg daily. \nIn certain cases with specific comorbidities, treatment of a primary \nbehavioral impairment led to the secondary improvement of misophonia \nsymptoms. For example, in a 4-year-old with autism, low-dose risperi -\ndone reportedly resolved misophonia symptoms (Naguy et al., 2022). In \na 14-year-old with comorbid ADHD, a combination of methylphenidate \nand CBT reportedly improved distractibility symptoms in addition to \nimproving distress tolerance to misophonia triggers [32]. Lastly, in a \ncase of misophonia with primarily autonomic symptoms (e.g., increased \nheart rate, sweating, rapid breathing), propranolol one hour before each \nmeal reduced symptoms from severe (15) to subclinical (2) levels on the \nA-MISO-S [54]. \n4.Discussion \nTo date, there has been a paucity of research on the treatment of \nmisophonia. This systematic review highlights preliminary efficacy for \none non-exposure-based CBT protocol [22], as well as preliminary case \nstudy-level support for a number of other psychotherapeutic approaches. The only randomized control trial to date [22] describes a \ngroup therapy CBT approach, implementing task concentration exer-\ncises, positive affect labeling, stimulus manipulation, and arousal \nreduction techniques. This approach was significantly superior to a \nwaitlist control in misophonia severity reduction, and improvements \nwere maintained post-CBT treatment and at 1 year follow up. Across this \nrandomized trial and many other case studies, CBT-based interventions \nwith variable core components demonstrated potential in the treatment \nof misophonia. This is consistent with previous literature on related \ndisorders (e.g., anxiety, OCD) and we posit that this may be due to \nsimilar mechanisms (e.g., associative and non-associative learning re-\nsponses to aversive stimuli) underlying the development and mainte -\nnance of symptoms across these conditions [33]. CBT is believed to \ntarget maladaptive learned responses to trigger sounds through cogni -\ntive techniques such as positive affect labeling and acceptance, as well as \nbehavioral strategies such as exposure and affect regulation skills. \nHowever, the high prevalence of anger and disgust responses, as well as \nthe sensory nature of misophonia, suggest the underlying mechanism of \nmisophonia may be related to but distinct from primary anxiety disor -\nders [35,56] . Targeting anger and disgust responses through nuanced \ntherapy approaches beyond CBT may prove to be an effective approach. \nSeveral case reports described benefit from exposure-based CBT \nprotocols utilizing a traditional habituation model of exposure. How-\never, exposure therapy is not widely accepted as a credible intervention \namong individuals with misophonia [47], and it has been argued that \nexposure therapy can have deleterious effects [12]. An inhibitory \nlearning model may better target the unique symptoms of misophonia \nby emphasizing distress tolerance and violating expectancies about \ntriggers by using more adaptive approaches when confronting them \n(Frank & McKay, 2019). While there is promise in various CBT pro-\ntocols, it is unclear what components are most effective and contribute \nto response. For example, the current protocols described by Jager et al. \n[22] and Schroder et al. [43] include elements that are not classically \nthought of as exposure, but carry elements of exposure in the intro-\nduction of trigger sounds during counter-conditioning procedures, \nwhich involve pairing a misophonia trigger with a pleasant stimulus to \ndevelop a new positive association with the trigger. It remains unclear \nwhich of these modalities contribute to the positive outcomes reported \nin these initial reports; dismantling studies are needed to understand \ncore treatment components that contribute to outcome. \nThere is preliminary evidence for third-wave behavioral approaches \nsuch as ACT and DBT, suggesting possible benefits from implementing \nmindfulness and acceptance techniques. Mindfulness techniques may \nprovide patients with an adaptive framework for engaging with distress \nevoking stimuli by taking a present-centered, non-judgmental perspec -\ntive. Mindfulness techniques may assist in creating psychological dis-\ntance from negative thoughts while fostering openness towards a \npatient ’s anger [40], allowing them to strategically re-engage in \nmeaningful activities, even if misophonia symptoms are ongoing. \nMoving beyond case report data is necessary to understand the potential \nutility of interventions like ACT for misophonia. \nWhile the psychotherapeutic literature is at a relatively early stage, \nresearch on pharmacotherapy for misophonia is in its infancy. Case re-\nports provide preliminary directions. For example, the autonomic \narousal implicated in misophonic responses [13] can be directly \ndampened by specific medications such as β-Blockers [54]. As research \ncontinues taking steps towards understanding the underlying neuro- \nphysiological mechanisms of misophonia [44], future research should \nfocus on understanding how the physiologic response can be targeted \nwith appropriate medications. \nWhile overall response rates to published CBT reports for misophonia \nwere generally positive, the lack of validated measures beyond the \nsingle-item CGI-I reveal a gap in the current treatment research para-\ndigm. Psychometrically valid measures of misophonia symptom severity \nare needed to determine if treatment modalities are consistently effi-\ncacious. The A-MISO-S measures, modeled after the Y-BOCS, are most S.A. Mattson et al."

However, it remains unclear if the self-report nature of this \nscale is optimal (relative to clinician rated administrations, as the Y- \nBOCS is done); concerns about self-reported Y-BOCS ratings have been \nreported, especially items that tap into resistance and control di-\nmensions of symptom severity [49]. Based on our clinical experience, we \nhypothesize similar issues may exist in self-reported misophonia \nseverity. \nDespite the first report of misophonia in the literature almost two \ndecades ago, there exists no single frontline treatment for misophonia to \ndate. This systematic review of misophonia treatments highlights the \nsignificant lack of strong empirical support for any interventions for \nmisophonia. Several directions for future research are noted. First, and \nmost broadly, development of mechanistically informed treatment \nprotocols that have meaningful stakeholder engagement are needed. \nTreatment development efforts should engage multiple stakeholders (i. \ne., individuals with lived experience, clinicians, researchers) to develop \nrobust and acceptable interventions that will translate well to real-world \nclinical settings. Second, future studies should focus on further re-\nfinements of promising extant interventions (e.g., dose of treatment, \nisolation of specific components) and replication by a second, inde-\npendent team. Third, third-wave and pharmacological approaches may \nhold promise but require considerable additional study. Fourth, as \nmentioned previously, limitations of the overall literature which impact \nthe present study include a lack of robust comparative trials as well as a \nlack of psychometrically validated measures for diagnosis and \nmeasuring severity. Using the growing pool of psychometrically vali-\ndated measures of misophonia (both currently published, and measures \nto be developed) in assessing treatment efficacy is necessary. While the \nmisophonia intervention literature is at an early stage, there is an op-\nportunity to use strong scientific methods to build on the foundational \nresearch that has been done to date to develop efficacious treatments \nthat reducing suffering and improve quality of life for children and \nadults with misophonia. \nAuthor note \nResearch reported in this publication was supported by a grant from \nthe Ream Foundation, as well as the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \nInstitute of Child Health & Human Development of the National In-\nstitutes of Health under Award Number P50HD103555 for use of the \nClinical and Translational Core facilities.
