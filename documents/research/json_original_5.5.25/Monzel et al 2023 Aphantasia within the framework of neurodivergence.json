Using both the social and medical models of \ndisability, this article discusses the extent to which aphantasia can be understood as a disorder or \njust a form of neutral neurodivergence, given that imagery plays a central role in thinking and \nmemory for most other people. Preliminary school performance data are presented, showing that \nlow imagery does not necessarily complicate life, especially given compensatory strategies and \nlow societal barriers. In addition, we discuss the consequences of labelling aphantasia a disorder \nwith regard to self- and public stigma, and we provide further data regarding a confidence gap, by \nwhich aphantasics perceive themselves as performing worse than they objectively do. We \nconclude that aphantasia should be understood as neutral neurodivergence and that labelling it a \ndisorder is not only wrong, but potentially harmful.   \n1.Introduction \nThe term ‘neuro(logical) diversity ’ was first coined within the 1990s by an online community of autistics and other people with \nneurological conditions to describe human cognitive variation (Dekker, 2023 ). It describes ‘the idea that people experience and \ninteract with the world around them in many different ways ’ and that ‘there is no one right way of thinking, learning, and behaving, \nand differences are not viewed as deficits ’ (Baumer & Frueh, 2021 , para. 1). The term ‘neurodiversity ’ is often used in the context of \nAutism Spectrum Conditions, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and symbolic dysfunctions such as Dyslexia, Dyscalculia and \nDyspraxia (Clouder et al., 2020 ), which are often described as neurodivergent conditions, that is, they ‘diverge significantly from the \ndominant societal standards of ‘normal ’’ (Walker, 2014 , para. 26). Some of these conditions have been linked to weaknesses in \nabilities, for example, in reading (Dyslexia) or arithmetic (Dyscalculia). However, neurodivergent differences should not be seen as \ninherent deficits per se, not least since some forms of neurodivergence lead to unique strengths. For instance, autism is associated with \nbenefits in attention-to-detail, ability to concentrate on a single topic, or effective systemizing (Wheelwright et al., 2006 ).

The ‘gold standard’ self-report measure for aphantasia is the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ; Marks, \n1973, 1995) in which participants rate the degree to which their visual thinking is picture-like. In one item, for example, participants \nare required to imagine the appearance of the sea on a warm summer’s day. People with aphantasia respond with the lowest two \nresponse-scale options, indicating they have either no picture-like image at all, or one that is only ‘vague and dim’ (e.g., Keogh & \nPearson, 2018; Zeman et al., 2015). Importantly, people with aphantasia tend to have intact visual knowledge (i.e., they know what the \nsea looks like) but this knowledge is not expressed in the mind as a mental picture. Also important is that people show excellent \nmetacognition about their own imagery abilities, and so self-report measures such as the VVIQ correlate well with objective behav -\nioural validations (e.g., Keogh & Pearson, 2018; Pearson et al., 2011). Large-scale screening studies now show that 3.9% of the \npopulation has aphantasia (Dance et al., 2022), making it a minority. However, Simner (2021) points out that the population of \naphantasics world-wide is close to the entire population of the United States, and that over 15,000 people with aphantasia are born \neach day. Viewed in this way, we can see that aphantasia, although a minority, is not insignificant. \nGiven that aphantasia is a distinct neuropsychological variation, it reflects the biological fact of neurodiversity, i.e., ’the diversity of \nhuman minds, the infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within our species’ (Walker, 2014, para. 8). But is aphantasia a \ndisorder or just a form of neutral neurodivergence? On this point there has been notable discrepancy in the literature, with some \nresearchers framing aphantasia as simply an ‘intriguing variation in human experience’ (Zeman et al., 2020, p. 18), while others go as \nfar as to define aphantasia as a ‘mental illness’ (Yang, 2022, p. 1037), although there is no data suggesting a pathological origin. In fact, \nmany of the conditions described above are often thought of as non-pathological interindividual differences rather than disorders. The \naim of this statement paper is therefore to present an argued view of aphantasia not only as a form of neurodivergence, but to oppose \nthe idea that aphantasia is necessarily a disorder or impairment (see also Monzel, Vetterlein, et al., 2022). To this end, we consider \nbelow a set of objective standards by which aphantasia might be evaluated. \n2.The social model of disability \nScotland’s National Autism Implementation Team created a model to illustrate different aspects of neurodiversity (Shah et al., \n2022). They argued that neurotypicality is the typical statistical range of a specific neurocognitive function2 as depicted in Fig. 1. In the \ncase of aphantasia, this would be the ability to create mental imagery. From this perspective, a neurotypical person is an individual that \nfalls within statistical societal norms of this specific neurocognitive function and a neurodivergent person falls outside of these norms, \nthat is, scores a predefined distance below average or above average on that particular cognitive function. A neurodevelopmental \ndisorder, on the other hand, is present when the deviation from societal norms is so extreme that significant functional impairments \noccur, which, for example, makes it difficult to participate in social life. This, however, does not mean that a disorder cannot also be \nconsidered a form of neurodivergence. The risk for functional impairment increases the more extreme the deviation from the societal \nnorms, in part because the deviation makes interacting with the environment all the more difficult. For instance, Dyslexia would not \nqualify as a problem at all, if a society did not rely so much on the written word. This view is in line with the social model of disability \n(Shakespeare, 2006), which suggests that disabilities are the consequence of the interaction between societal barriers and individual \ndifferences. Indeed, this school of thought suggests that extreme mental imagery (either side of the mean) would only qualify as a \ndisorder if the societal barriers were high enough to provoke functional impairments in daily living. Decreased or increased imagery \nalone, however, would not be sufficient for a classification of a disorder. \nUnder this depiction above, one would indeed consider aphantasia as neurodivergence, but should it also be considered a neu-\nrodevelopmental disorder? In most cases, aphantasia is certainly neurodevelopmental (although some acquired cases do exist; e.g., \nKnowles et al., 2021) but does it have the qualities we associate with disorders? To answer this, it is necessary to examine the extent of \nfunctional impairment seen in aphantasia. A lack of mental imagery does not seem sufficient, in and of itself, to give rise to any great \namount of functional impairment. Indeed, in the majority of cases, aphantasics simply do not know they are missing an ability that \nmost other people possess, and when they do find out, only one third of them feel any considerable amount of personal distress \n(Monzel, Vetterlein, et al., 2022). However, previous research has identified certain correlates of aphantasia that might be seen as \nfunctional impairments. For example, aphantasics experience less detailed autobiographical memory (Dawes et al., 2022; Milton et al., \n2021; Zeman et al., 2020) and lower emotional reactivity to verbally presented stimuli (Monzel, Keidel, et al., 2023; Wicken et al., \n2021). Nonetheless, they also possess traits that give them distinct advantages, being, for example, potentially protected from the trait \nof sensory hyper-sensitivity (i.e., they may be significantly less overwhelmed or distressed by sensory events, such as bright lights, \npowerful smells or loud noises; Dance, Ward, et al., 2021). In some ways, the biggest barrier to aphantasics might actually be a lack of \n1 Aphantasia was originally defined in the visual sense, but can also co-occur with poor imagery in other senses (e.g., poor olfactory imagery). For \na discussion of terminology relating to these other senses, see Lambert and Sibley, 2022; Monzel et al., 2022a, 2022b and Simner and Dance, 2022. \n2Shah et al.’s (2022) model includes only neurocognitive functions. However, the original coiner of the term ‘neurodivergent’ included differ -\nences in all neurological structures and functions in the conception of neurodivergence, e.g., epilepsy, cluster headaches, and chiari malformation \n(Asasumasu, 2023).

Hillary (2020) , for example, goes as far as to refer to ‘cross-cultural communication ’ when people \nwith and without aphantasia communicate together (see also Fox-Muraton, 2021 ). They provide several examples where people with \nmental imagery assume an absence of imagery equates to an absence of visual knowledge (which is almost never the case), and that \nsimple tasks of thinking cannot be performed if imagery is not used. On the contrary, tasks historically associated with imagery (e.g., \nmental rotation) are easily performed by people with aphantasia relying on visual knowledge alone, and there are often no objective \nperformance differences (e.g., Pounder et al., 2018 ). This is because people with aphantasia simply use alternative strategies to solve \nthe same tasks without mental imagery, using their intact and sometimes superior abilities (e.g., in spatial processing; Keogh et al., \n2021 ), which is also mirrored in different neural network activity (Logie et al., 2011 ). After all, this might also be one reason why there \nis no evidence to date for disadvantages for aphantasics in everyday life, for example at school or work (although this issue has not been \nextensively explored yet). Table 1 presents our own data showing correlations between vividness of visual imagery and school grades \nin different school subjects at different class levels. For this, we asked 115 participants (mean age 22.93, SD 11.61; 43.5% female, \n53.9% male, 2.6% non-binary) to provide their current or past school certificates to assess associations between school performance \nand imagery ability. There is moderate (BF01 F3) to strong (BF01 F5) evidence for the null hypothesis that school performance in most \nsubjects is not associated with visual imagery vividness. As suggested above, one reason may be the various different strategies for \nthinking, which might translate into multiple ways to learn (other than using imagery), as well as class-level or school-level factors (e. \ng., influence of teachers; school environment) which may conceivably overwrite any marginal influence of mental imagery (cf. Hattie, \n2008 ). \nHowever, there are three domains where neurocognitive differences for aphantasia are reliably found: in memory, emotional \nreactivity, and face recognition. But is this sufficient for a label of ‘disorder‘? For memory, the largest deficits are in autobiographical \nmemory recall (Dawes et al., 2022; Milton et al., 2021; Zeman et al., 2020 ), while differences in everyday memory (Monzel et al., 2021; \nMonzel, Vetterlein, et al., 2022 ) and working memory (Pounder et al., 2022 ) are relatively small or non-existent. For lower emotional \nreactivity, there is some evidence of this in reading (i.e., reading frightful or empathy-triggering material; Monzel et al., 2023; Wicken \net al., 2021 ) but not when watching similar material visually. This suggests no emotional deficit per se, but rather, that poor imagery \nlimits ‘emotional amplification‘ (see Holmes et al., 2008 ). However, these differences are far less impactful than, say, face recognition \ndeficits in prosopagnosia (for face recognition data in aphantasics, see Dance et al., 2023; Monzel, Vetterlein, et al., 2023 ). As such, \nthey may rise to the level of functional impairments only rarely.3 \nGiven the discussion above, Monzel, Vetterlein, et al. (2022) suggest taking an individualized approach, by medicalising only on a \ncase-by-case basis, for any aphantasic whose poor imagery means they suffer greatly, or where educational or healthcare support \nFig. 1.Replica of Shah et al.’s (2022) model of neurodiversity.

They further suggest that the very discovery of aphantasia itself (i.e., the realisation that one’s internal world is \ndramatically different to others) might sometimes argue for the diagnosis of a temporary adjustment disorder (e.g., due to a sense of \notherness). This would be in line with the model by Shah et al. (2022) who propose that only people on the neurodevelopmental \nspectrum showing specific functional impairments should be treated as having a neurodevelopmental disorder. Therefore, functional \nimpairments themselves, either statistically associated with aphantasia or otherwise co-occurring but statistically unrelated, should be \ndiagnosed aside from aphantasia (e.g., visual agnosia) rather than pathologizing aphantasia itself. This is especially important since \nmany neurodivergent individuals fall under multiple categories of neurodivergence (e.g. Russell & Pavelka, 2013) and impairments \nmight be attributable to the co-occurring conditions rather than to aphantasia itself (see: Associations between aphantasia and autism). \nFinally, although Shah et al.’s (2022) model suggests that neurodivergence does increase the risk for specific functional impairments, it \nalso suggests it increases the risk for advantages. We saw above that people with aphantasia may be protected from sensory hyper- \nsensitivities, and we might also consider that it is protective to experience lower emotional distress when confronted with frightful \npassages or, potentially, memories (Monzel et al., 2023; Wicken et al., 2021). In both these ways, aphantasia may be somewhat \nprotective against mental health conditions, and a similar argument has been made about mental health conditions directly linked to \nintrusive imagery (such as post-traumatic stress disorder; Dawes et al., 2020; Keogh et al., 2023). \nOverall, from reviewing aphantasia in relation to the social model of disability, we first suggest that aphantasia is best understood \nwithin the framework of neurodivergence (following Shah et al., 2022) but second, that the traits of aphantasia are rarely problematic \nenough to diagnose a neurodevelopmental disorder, because they are in most cases not strong enough to encounter societal barriers. In \nother words, mental imagery deficits might seem extreme to people with intact mental imagery, but the societal barriers are low, life is \naffected very little, and there are few functional impairments in day-to-day life (see Fig. 2). \n3.The medical model of disability \nIn contrast to the social model of disability, the medical model of disability focuses more on the biological differences between \npeople with and without aphantasia. Previous research has indeed found a number of neurological differences between high imagers \nand low imagers. For example, Fulford et al. (2018) found that weaker imagers showed increased activation (compared to stronger \nimagers) across a more widespread set of brain regions during a task that required mental visualization. This included greater acti-\nvation in early visual cortices. One model has explained this as greater cortical excitability in low imagers (which worsens the signal- \nto-noise ratio of the mental image; Keogh et al., 2020) while other models suggest lower cortical excitability (given its co-occurrence \nwith dampened sensory sensitivity; Dance, Ward, et al., 2021). Fulford et al. (2018) also found that frontal activation was higher in \nhigh imagers relative to low imagers (see also Zeman et al., 2010, for acquired aphantasia). In addition, Logie et al. (2011) found \ndiffering brain activation between high and low imagers in premotor and motor areas during mental rotation, interpreting these \ndifferent activations as evidence of different mental strategies. A study by Milton et al. (2020) revealed higher resting state connec -\ntivity between the visual occipital network and several prefrontal regions in people with hyperphantasia, relative to people with \naphantasia, suggesting better working top-down processes during the generation of mental imagery (cf. Pearson, 2019). \nIn sum, people with aphantasia clearly show a number of functional neurological differences when compared to their peers. They \nmight also, potentially, show genetic differences (see Zeman et al., 2015, 2020 for an early discussion). But are these biological dif-\nferences in any way sufficient for us to conclude that aphantasia is a disorder? It would be extremely difficult to make this argument \nbased on biology alone, simply because this would also pathologize all neurological group differences ever described in the neuro -\nscience literature, that is, neurodiversity itself. In summary, although these biological differences exist, and might add to the picture of \naphantasia as a form of neurodivergence, we suggest these alone are not indicative for a neurodevelopmental disorder. \n4.The neurodiversity paradigm \nLast, it should be made explicit that both models described above, that is, the medical model and social model of disability, see \nneurodivergence as deviation from a ’normal’ brain, either solely biologically or in misalignment with societal norms, respectively. \nHowever, it can also be questioned whether something like a ‘normal’ brain really exists. This is done within the neurodiversity \nparadigm which sees the idea of a ’normal’ brain as a \"culturally constructed fiction, no more valid […] than the idea that there is one \n’normal’ or ’right’ ethnicity, gender, or culture\" (Walker, 2014, para. 19). From this perspective, aphantasia could never be described \nas a disorder, any more than any other form of neurodivergence that is an ’intrinsic and pervasive factor in an individual’s psyche, \npersonality, and fundamental way of relating to the world’ (Walker, 2014, para. 29). That being said, this does not, however, imply \nthat autism, ADHD or even aphantasia cannot be disabilities in certain situations. Instead, the neurodiversity movement has a key aim \nof reducing stigmatizing language as one of many accessibility criteria for neurodivergent individuals. For example, by speaking of \nautism, rather than Autism Spectrum Disorders (Monk et al., 2022). \n5.Associations between aphantasia and autism \nSince those who do not agree with the neurodiversity paradigm often describe autism as a disorder (e.g., Lord et al., 2018), we will \nnow consider whether aphantasia might be considered a disorder simply by virtue of its potential comorbidity with autism-related \ntraits. However, we note that from the perspective of the neurodiversity paradigm, associations with autism-related traits alone do \nnot automatically justify a classification as a disorder, since autism would not be considered a disorder in and of itself. \nPeople with autism experience a range of sensory and developmental differences, for example in attention (e.g., heightened M.

They also experience difficulties in imagination (American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ). Dance, \nJaquiery, et al. (2021) showed for the first time that people with aphantasia have higher autism-related traits than people with typical \nimagery. They administered the The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001 ), a questionnaire that elicits autism- \nrelated traits (e.g., “I frequently find that I don’t know how to keep a conversation going ”), and found that AQ scores were signifi -\ncantly higher in aphantasics versus imagers. Similar results were found by Milton et al. (2021) . Dance, Jaquiery et al. (2021) also found \nthat the aphantasia group was far more likely to contain individuals that surpassed the AQ threshold indicative of a likely autism \ndiagnosis. However, Dance and colleagues further demonstrated that people with aphantasia were different to controls only in two of \nthe five factors measured by the AQ, that is, scoring lower in social skills and imagination. They were no different than imagers in the \nremaining three scales of communication, attention-to-detail, and attention switching (Dance, Jaquiery, et al., 2021 ). Dance and \ncolleagues also showed that people with aphantasia had lower sensory sensitivity relative to imagers (Dance, Ward, et al., 2021 ). \nDifferences in sensory sensitivity also characterize autism (Bogdashina, 2003; Robertson & Simmons, 2015 ), although these are non- \ndiagnostic autistic traits. On the other hand, the AQ difference in the social skills subscale had only a small effect size. And while the \neffect size for imagination was large, some portion of these questions were quasi-statements of aphantasia/visual recall (despite the \nauthors ’ best efforts to avoid this confound). Taken together, these findings suggest that while aphantasia and autism might be linked \nby specific clusters of traits (i.e., poorer social skills and imagination, differences in sensory sensitivity), they do not share other \nbroader autism-linked deficits (i.e., in communication, attention-to-detail and attention switching). As such, aphantasia does not \nrepresent a close companion to autism, and most people with aphantasia do not have autism. Hence, it is difficult to rely on a link \nbetween aphantasia and autism as a way to categorize the former as a disorder. Overall, however, a justification as a disorder based \nsolely on a link to another condition would be difficult anyway. \n6.Aphantasia and ‘Werkzeugst orungen ’ \nOne final way to conceptualise aphantasia might be to consider a cluster of conditions described in German as ‘Werk -\nzeugst orungen‘. This term is roughly translated as ‘dysfunctions in the use of tools‘, and includes Dyslexia, Dyscalculia and Dyspraxia \n(all currently listed in the ICD-10 under the identifier ‘R48: Dyslexia and other symbolic dysfunctions, not elsewhere classified‘; World \nHealth Organization, 2019 ). Clearly, any emphasis on ‘dysfunction ’ does not fit within our general thesis above (suggesting aphantasia \nas a form of neutral neurodivergence, but not a disorder). However, the idea of imagery as a ‘mental/cognitive tool’ might provide an \ninteresting avenue for future research, because it provides a way to view the impairment as targeted on the tool, not the person (nor \nany wider functions). Unlike aphantasia, the ‘Werkzeugst orungen‘ of dyslexia, dyscalculia and dyspraxia can lead to major societal \nbarriers, but this is because their tools (i.e., symbolic systems of digits, letters and words) cannot be impaired without significant \nsocietal difficulties. In contrast, we suggest that the tool of imagery can be impaired in and of itself, without any great or necessary \nimpairment for the individual. \nFig. 2.Application of Shah et al.’s (2022) model of neurodiversity to mental imagery.

Despite this, many people with aphantasia \nreport less confidence in their abilities, even where objective differences are not found (e.g. Wittmann & S¸atırer, 2022 ). Often, they \nalso report difficulties with some abilities which are thought to be related to mental imagery, such as art making (Monzel, Vetterlein, \net al., 2022 ), although such difficulties are not necessarily given (MacKisack et al., 2022 ). How can we reconcile this mismatch be-\ntween self-report and objective data? One suggestion might be that it is caused or magnified by the labelling of aphantasia as a deficit. \nWe suggest that when people with aphantasia are asked how confident they are with their own performance in some tasks, they are at \nrisk of giving lower confidence ratings than their objective performance would actually allow for, as a form of self-stigmatization \n(Corrigan & Wassel, 2008 ). For example, Fig. 3 presents data from a visual memory task (Monzel et al., n.d.), illustrating a confi -\ndence gap in aphantasia, which might also reflect the belief that they might be performing worse than their peers with imagery. The \nsmall objective impact of aphantasia is overestimated by aphantasics themselves, and might therefore have a considerable impact not \nonly on how aphantasia is viewed by science, but also on the self-image of aphantasics. Labelling aphantasia as a ‘mental illness ’ (e.g., \nYang, 2022 ) is likely to enlarge this self-stigmatization and thereby magnify the confidence gap. On the other hand, framing aphantasia \nsimply as a form of neutral neurodivergence might allow us to better consider both advantages and disadvantages. Importantly, using \nthis approach, aphantasia is not defined as an inherent disorder. Instead, we can view aphantasia as a variance in mental experience, \nand examine or indeed celebrate its unique profile of traits. \n8.Final thoughts \nIn this opinion piece we have made a case for aphantasia within a framework of neurodivergence. This framework promotes \naphantasia for its uniqueness as a variance in mental experience and therefore as another beautiful proof for neurodiversity. Moreover, \nwe found no evidence to justify a general conceptualization of aphantasia as a disorder. Instead, we suggest that aphantasia should \nalways be evaluated individually and in the context of consequences and barriers for an individual in society. This approach inherently \nsuggests that changes need not to come from the individual, but from societal barriers themselves. Overall, we advocate that the \nlanguage used to describe a community should be helpful and appropriate, not only for scientists but for those experiencing it (for a \nFig. 3.Illustration of the confidence gap with the data of a visual recognition task (paradigm according to Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990 ). \nNote.

Post-hoc tests \nrevealed that aphantasics (n 126) and controls (n 135) differed in confidence (p D.001), but not in performance (p .665). For analysis, all \nrecognition conditions were collapsed. M. Monzel et al."
