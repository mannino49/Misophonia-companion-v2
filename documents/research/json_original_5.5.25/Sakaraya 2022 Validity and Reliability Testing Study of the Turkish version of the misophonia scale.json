One  of  the  biggest  obstacles  to  misophonia  research  is  the  scarcity  \nof  psychometrically  robust  assessment  tools.  The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  evaluate  \nthe  Misophonia  Questionnaire  (Misophonia  Questionnaire;  Wu  et  al.,  2014).\nTo  meet  the  need  for  a  measurement  tool  for  clinical  and  population-based  \nassessments  of  misophonia  by  making  its  Turkish  adaptation.  The  research  \nwas  carried  out  with  638  undergraduate  students  aged  between  18-26  at  \nBaÿkent  University.  Exploratory  (N  =  420)  and  confirmatory  factor  analysis  (N  \n=  218)  were  applied  within  the  scope  of  construct  validity,  and  internal  \nconsistency  and  discriminant  validity  tests  were  performed.  Internal  consistency,  \nsplit-half  and  test-retest  methods  were  used  for  reliability.  In  the  exploratory  \nfactor  analysis,  it  was  observed  that  the  scale  had  a  three-factor  structure:  \nmisophonia  symptoms,  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors  -  avoidance  and  \ninternalization,  misophonia  feelings  and  behaviors  -  aggression  and  \nexternalization .  In  the  confirmatory  factor  analysis,  the  fit  indices  for  the  three-\nfactor  structure  were  found  to  be  within  acceptable  limits.  As  a  result  of  \ndiscriminant  validity,  it  was  seen  that  those  with  clinical  misophonia  had  a  \nhigher  mean  in  all  factors  than  those  without.  The  Cronbach  Alpha  internal  \nconsistency  coefficient  for  the  whole  scale  was  .89  (for  the  factors  .79,  .85  and  \n.83,  respectively),  the  halving  reliability  coefficient  was  .83  (.86,  .87  and  .81  for  \nthe  factors),  and  the  test-retest  reliability  coefficient  was  found  to  be .

People  with  misophonia  can  feel  disgust,  anger,  anxiety,  and  they  may   \nexperience  anger  outbursts  when  exposed  to  certain  sounds  that  are  insignificant  to  other  people,  such  as  chewing,   lip-\nsmacking,  and  breathing.  There  is  no  consensus  on  the  prevalence,  assessment,  and  management  of  misophonia.  A   \nmajor  barrier  to  the  research  on  misophonia  is  the  lack  of  robust  psychometric  assessment  tools.  This  study  aims  to  \nmeet   the  need  for  a  measurement  tool  for  clinical  and  population-based  evaluations  intended  for  misophonia  by  adapting  \nthe   Misophonia  Questionnaire  (Wu  et  al.,  2014)  to  Turkish.  The  research  was  carried  out  on  638  undergraduate  students  \nat   Baskent  University,  from  18  to  26  years  of  age.  Exploratory  factor  analysis  was  conducted  on  420  participants  (73%   \nfemale,  27%  male)  and  confirmatory  factor  analysis  was  conducted  on  218  participants  (62%  female,  38%  male).  The   \nstatistical  reliability  was  evaluated  using  the  internal  consistency  coefficient,  split  half,  and  test-retest  methods.  In  the   \nMisophonia  Questionnaire,  misophonia  was  explained  by  the  following  three  subscale  factors:  misophonia  symptoms,   \nmisophonia  emotions  and  behaviors-avoidance  and  internalization,  and  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors-aggression   \nand  externalization.  These  were  used  in  the  exploratory  factor  analysis.  The  confirmatory  factor  analysis  found  that  the   \nfit  indexes  were  within  acceptable  limits.  With  the  discriminant  validity,  the  participants  with  clinical  misophonia  were   \nobserved  to  have  a  higher  mean  in  all  factors  than  those  without.  The  internal  consistency  coefficient  of  the  scale  was   \ncalculated  at  .89,  and  for  the  three  subscale  factors  mentioned  earlier  were  .79,  .85,  and  .83,  respectively.  The  calculated   \ntest-retest  reliability  coefficient  was  .78,  which  applied  to  75  participants.  The  split-half  reliability  coefficient  was  .83   (for  \neach  subscale  factor,  was  .86,  .87,  and  .81,  respectively).  With  this  study,  the  Misophonia  Questionnaire,  which  can   be  \nused  to  evaluate  misophonia  in  the  general  population,  was  adapted  into  Turkish.  From  the  psychometric  analysis,   data  \nsupporting  the  validity  and  reliability  of  the  Misophonia  Scale  were  obtained.  \n232   Validity  and  Reliability  Test  of  the  Turkish  Version  of  the  Misophonia  Scale\nThe  items  of  the  MQ  were  translated  into  Turkish  by  a  native  translator.  Whether  the   items  \ngave  the  same  meaning  in  different  cultures  was  checked  by  the  researchers.  Lastly,   the  \ntranslations  were  checked  by  two  linguists.  After  the  necessary  adjustments  were  made,   the  final  \nversion  of  the  scale  was  created.  The  research  was  carried  out  on  638  undergraduate   students  at  \nBaskent  University,  from  18  to  26  years  of  age.  Exploratory  factor  analysis  was   There  are  a  variety  of  scales  evaluating  misophonia,  such  as  the  Amsterdam  Misophonia   \nQuestionnaire  (A-MISO-S;  Schröder  et  al.,  2013),  Misophonia  Questionnaire  (MQ)  (Wu  et  al.,   \n2014)  and  MisoQuest  (Siepsiak  et  al.,  2020).  However,  there  is  no  valid  and  reliable  Turkish   \nmeasurement  tool  to  evaluate  the  symptoms  and  effects  of  misophonia.  Therefore,  the  aim   of  the  \ncurrent  study  is  to  adapt  the  MQ  (Wu  et  al.,  2014)  into  Turkish.  EXTENDED  ABSTRACT  \nMethod  Misophonia,  defined  as  an  abnormally  strong  reaction  to  a  sound  with  a  specific   pattern  and/\nor  meaning  to  an  individual  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2014),  is  a  phenomenon   that  has  not  been  \ngiven  enough  attention  in  the  literature  until  recent  years.  Studies   on  misophonia  consist  mostly  of  \ncase  reports;  thus,  studies  with  large  populations  are   necessary  to  understand  this  phenomenon.  \nMeasurement  tools  have  been  developed  in   the  international  literature  in  recent  years  to  better  \nunderstand  the  nature  of  misophonia.

      "text": "While  the  original  of  the  MQ  was  explained  with  two  factors,  based  on  the  results  of   the  \nexploratory  factor  analysis,  the  Turkish  adaptation  of  the  scale  was  explained  with  three   factors\n—by  the  number  of  eigenvalues  greater  than  1,  Horn’s  (1965)  parallel  analysis  and   screen  plot  \nmethods.  The  second  original  factor,  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors  is   explained  with  two  \nsub-factors.  To  discuss  and  confirm  the  accuracy  of  this  factor,  it  was   discussed  with  the  author  \nof  the  original  scale,  Dr.  Wu.  The  final  version  of  the  scale  was   formed  by  renaming  the  factors.  \nThe  first  factor  was  named  as  “misophonia  symptom,”  the   second  factor  “misophonia  emotions  \nand  behaviors—avoidance  and  internalization,”  the   third  factor  “misophonia  emotions  and  \nbehaviors—aggression  and  externalization.”  The   principal  component  analysis  and  direct  oblimin  \nrotation  methods  were  used  to  determine   the  structural  validity  of  the  MQ.  According  to  the  \nexploratory  factor  analysis  results,  the   Bartlett’s  test  statistic  for  sphericity  was  obtained—(ÿ2  =  \n2948.28  df  =  136  p  <  .001)—and   the  Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  coefficient  was  .89,  so  it  was  found  to  \nbe  sufficient  (Alpar,  2017).   \nThe  percentage  of  variance  for  the  first,  second  and  third  factors  were  37.13%,  10.83%,  and   \n7.56%,  respectively,  with  a  total  variance  of  55.2%.  According  to  the  confirmatory  factor   analysis,  \nit  was  observed  that  the  fit  indexes  of  the  model  were  within  acceptable  limits:  ÿ2 /  df  =  2.23,  \nRoot  Mean  Square  Error  of  Approximation  (RMSEA)  =  .07,  Comparative  Fit  Index   (CFI)  =  .91,  \nGoodness  of  Fit  Index  (GFI)  =  .88,  and  Adjustment  Goodness  of  Fit  Index  (AGFI)  =   .84  \n(Özdamar,  2017).  Regarding  the  discriminant  validity,  clinical  misophonia  was  observed   to  have  \na  higher  mean  in  all  factors  than  those  without.  Results  conducted  on  420  participants  (73%  female,  27%  male)  and  confirmatory  factor  analysis  was   \nconducted  on  218  participants  (62%  female,  38%  male).   \nThe  MQ  contains  17  items.  The  original  scale  consists  of  three  parts:  “misophonia   \nsymptoms,”  “misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors,”  and  “misophonia  severity.”  The  items  are   \nscored  from  0  (not  at  all  true)  to  4  (always  true).  The  misophonia  symptom  factor  consists   of  \nseven  specific  sounds  that  often  cause  annoyance  in  individuals.  The  misophonia   emotions  and  \nbehaviors  factor  evaluates  negative  feelings  and  behaviors  developing  against   misophonia  \nsymptoms.  Misophonia  severity,  the  last  part  of  the  scale,  gives  information   about  the  severity  \nof  misophonia  and  is  not  included  in  the  factor  structure  and  scoring.  In   this  section,  the  \nparticipant  is  asked  to  score  sensitive  sounds  on  a  scale  from  1  (minimal)  to   15  (very  severe),  \naccording  to  the  degree  that  it  affects  their  daily  life.  Scores  of  seven  and   above  indicate  \nclinically  significant  misophonia  (Wu  et  al.,  2014).  The  17  items  from  section   1  and  2  are  included  \nin  the  scoring  of  the  scale.  \n233  Deniz  Sakarya  M,  Cakmak  E\nPsychology  Studies  -  Studies  in  Psychology  Vol/Volume:  42,  Issue/Issue:  1,  2022Machine Translated by Google"

      "text": "Until  recent  years,  evaluation  and  treatment  reports  in  the  form  of  case  reports  have  \nbeen  published  in  the  literature,  and  more  recently,  studies  with  larger  samples  have  \nbeen  planned  in  order  to  better  understand  the  nature  of  misophonia,  to  evaluate  and  \nmanage  misophonia  (eg,  Jager  et  al.,  2020a;  Rouw  and  Erfanian,  2018).  These  studies,  \nwhich  will  be  conducted  in  a  large  sample,  are  important  in  order  to  better  understand  the  \ndevelopment  of  misophonia,  other  disorders  associated  with  misophonia,  how  certain  \nfactors  modulate  the  severity  of  the  misophonic  response,  and  ultimately  to  develop  \nmanagement/ treatment  protocols.  Standard  measurement  tools  that  measure  misophonia  \nare  necessary  in  the  planning  of  these  scientific  studies.  Despite  the  existence  of  \nmeasurement  tools  whose  validity  and  reliability  are  supported  in  the  international  \nliterature,  the  lack  of  psychometrically  robust  assessment  tools  is  cited  as  the  biggest  \nobstacle  to  the  investigation  and  treatment  of  misophonia  (Rosenthal  et  al.,  2021).\nThere  is  no  standard  assessment  tool  in  Turkey,  studies  on  misophonia  are  still  \npublished  in  the  form  of  case  reports.  A  standard  assessment  tool  will  contribute  to  the  \ndissemination  of  research  on  misophonia  and  the  creation  of  a  common  literature  in  \nTurkey.  In  addition,  a  standard  Turkish  measurement  tool  was  used  to  evaluate  misophonia  \nin  clinical  use  and  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the  intervention.Misophonia  is  an  abnormally  strong  response  to  a  specific  and/or  meaningful  sound  \n(Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2014).  The  term  misophonia  was  coined  in  the  early  2000s  by  \ncombining  the  Greek  words  “miso” (hate)  and  “phonia” (sound)  to  describe  a  group  of  \npatients  who  differed  from  other  patients  in  terms  of  reduced  sound  tolerance  problem  \n(Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2001;  2014).  Individuals  with  misophonia  are  often  sensitive  to  \nsounds  that  are  considered  insignificant  by  other  people,  such  as  popping  gum,  chewing  \nand  cracking  sounds,  breathing,  whistling,  lip  smacking,  pencil  clicking  (Cavanna  &  Seri,  \n2015).  Individuals  may  feel  different  emotions  such  as  disgust,  anxiety  and  mild  anger  as  \na  result  of  their  extreme  sensitivity  to  sounds,  and  sometimes  they  may  experience  \ntantrums.  This  situation  causes  the  behavior  of  avoiding  the  triggering  sound  (Brout  et  al.,  \n2018).  The  severity  of  misophonia  varies  from  person  to  person,  and  as  its  severity  \nincreases,  it  negatively  affects  the  quality  of  life  of  people  (Jager  et  al.,  2020a).  The  \nnegative  effects  of  misophonia  on  people's  social  life,  school  life,  family  and  work  life  have  \nbeen  shown  in  many  studies  (Rouw  and  Erfanian,  2018;  Sanchez  and  da  Silva,  2018;  \nSchröder  et  al.,  2017).\nPsychology  Studies  -  Studies  in  Psychology  Vol/Volume:  42,  Issue/Issue:  1,  2022Deniz  Sakarya  M,  Cakmak  E\n235  Machine Translated by Google"

      "text": "Abnormal  reactions  to  certain  sounds  in  misophonia  in  different  situations  and  conditions  \nare  independent  of  the  hearing  of  individuals  and  mostly  the  intensity  and  other  physical  \ncharacteristics  of  the  sound.  Responses  to  sound  depend  more  on  the  context  in  which  the  \nsound  occurs,  past  experiences,  and  the  patient's  psychological  profile  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  \n2001;  Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2003;  Schröder  et  al.,  2013).  Although  the  etiology  is  not  fully  \nknown,  the  fact  that  this  complaint  has  also  been  reported  in  the  families  of  individuals  with  \nmisophonia  in  some  studies  in  the  literature  suggests  that  there  may  be  a  genetic  transmission  \n(Rouw  and  Erfanian,  2018;  Sanchez  and  da  Silva,  2018).  In  the  literature,  the  age  of  onset  is  \nshown  as  childhood  and  adolescence  (Edelstein  et  al.,  2013;  Sanchez  and  da  Silva,  2018;  \nSchröder  et  al.,  2013).Characteristics  and  Mechanism  of  Misophonia\nIt  is  stated  that  the  limbic  system  and  autonomic  nervous  system  play  a  primary  role  in  \nadverse  reactions  to  sound,  while  other  systems  in  the  brain  are  involved  in  the  process  \nsecondarily.  It  is  thought  that  the  auditory  system  functions  normally  in  individuals  who  develop  \nsuch  reactions  to  sound,  but  the  functional  connections  between  the  auditory  system,  the  limbic  \nsystem  and  the  autonomic  nervous  system  increase  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2014).\nIt  is  still  debated  whether  misophonia  is  a  potentially  inducible  physiological  condition,  a  \nsymptomatic  indicator  of  an  underlying  psychiatric  disorder,  or  a  separate  symptom  that  can  \nbe  seen  together  with  other  psychiatric  disorders  (Cavanna  and  Seri,  2015).  Although  it  is  not  \nincluded  in  current  diagnostic  criteria  such  as  DSM-5  and  ICD-10,  Schröder  et  al.  (2013)  \nreported  that  misophonia  should  be  evaluated  in  a  separate  psychiatric  disease  group  and  \npresented  some  diagnostic  criteria  regarding  this.It  is  also  important  in  terms  of  evidence-based  practice.  In  2018,  when  this  study  was  planned,  \nit  was  determined  that  the  only  measurement  tool  with  psychometric  evaluations  in  the  \ninternational  literature  was  the  Misophonia  Questionnaire- MQ;  Wu  et  al.,  2014.  Therefore,  in  \nthis  study,  it  was  aimed  to  translate  this  scale  into  our  language  and  to  test  the  psychometric  \nproperties  of  the  Turkish  version.  With  this  adapted  measurement  tool,  professionals  who  want  \nto  evaluate  misophonia  in  Turkey  and  examine  the  effectiveness  of  misophonia  treatment  will  \nbe  able  to  use  the  Misophonia  Scale,  which  is  a  standard  measurement  tool,  as  well  as  clinical  \nobservation  and  interview  forms,  and  thus  have  an  objective  tool  for  evaluation  and  follow-up.  \nIt  is  thought  that  with  the  adaptation  of  the  scale  to  Turkish,  scientific  studies  on  misophonia  \nwill  increase  in  our  country.\nPsychology  Studies  -  Studies  in  Psychology  Vol/Volume:  42,  Issue/Issue:  1,  2022Validity  and  Reliability  Test  of  the  Turkish  Version  of  the  Misophonia  Scale\n236   Machine Translated by Google"

In  Turkey,  Öz  (2016)  stated  that  misophonia  should  be  considered  as  a  \nseparate  psychiatric  condition  and  developed  various  diagnostic  criteria  for  misophonia  in  \nhis  research.  However,  some  psychiatrists  have  evaluated  misophonia  as  a  symptom  of  \ndifferent  psychiatric  problems  such  as  obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  generalized  anxiety  \ndisorder  or  schizotypal  personality  disorder  rather  than  a  separate  condition  (Ferreira  et  al.,  \n2013).  Jastreboff  and  Jastreboff  (2014),  on  the  other  hand,  reported  that  very  few  of  the  \npatients  with  misophonia  they  examined  under  the  sound  tolerance  problem  had  psychiatric  \nproblems,  and  that  most  of  these  patients  recovered  without  the  need  for  a  psychiatric  \nintervention  with  the  application  of  certain  versions  of  voice  therapy  and  counseling  \napproaches.  Although  it  has  been  reported  that  different  methods  such  as  Tinnitus  \nReeducation  Therapy  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2014),  Oppositional  Conditioning  (Dozier,  \n2015),  Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  (Jager  et  al.,  2020b;  Schröder  et  al.,  2017)  are  \neffective  in  the  management  of  misophonia,  a  consensus  has  been  reached.  There  is  no  established  standard  treatment  protocol.\nWith  the  increasing  interest  in  the  concept  in  the  international  arena,  some  measurement  \ntools  have  been  developed  to  evaluate  misophonia.  Among  these  tools  are  Amsterdam  \nMisophonia  Questionnaire  (A-MISO-S;  Schröder  et  al.,  2013),  Misophonia  Questionnaire  \n(MQ;  Wu  et  al.,  2014),  MisoQuest  (Siepsiak  et  al.,  2020),  The  Duke  Misophonia  Questi  \nonnaire  ( DMQ;  Rosenthal  et  al.,  2021);  Misophonia  Response  Scale  (Dibb  et  al.,  2021).  \nThe  A-MISO-S  is  the  first  tool  to  assess  misophonia,  created  by  adapting  the  Yale-Brown  \nObsessive-Compulsive  Scale  (Y-BOCS;  Goodman  et  al.,  1989)  items  to  misophonia.  When  \nthe  current  research  was  planned,  the  only  measurement  tool  available  apart  from  the  \nMisophonia  Scale  (Wu  et  al.,  2014)  was  the  A-MISO-S  (Schröder  et  al.,  2013),  and  its  \npsychometric  properties  were  not  presented  at  the  time  this  tool  was  developed,  and  its  \nvalidity  and  reliability  were  tested  later  (Naylor).  et  al.,  2020).  The  development  of  these  \nscales  has  enabled  the  concept  to  be  better  understood  by  disseminating  the  researches.Evaluation  of  Misophonia  \nMisophonia  has  not  been  a  frequently  evaluated  concept  until  recently.  One  of  the  \nreasons  why  misophonia,  for  which  academic  interest  has  been  low  until  recent  years,  has  \nnot  been  adequately  researched  in  the  international  literature  is  that  individuals  seeking  \ntreatment  apply  to  many  different  fields  such  as  otology,  audiology,  psychiatry,  psychology  \nand  neurology  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2014).  In  Turkey,  it  is  unclear  whether  misophonic  \nindividuals  perceive  their  misophonia  as  a  problem  and  to  which  units  they  refer.\nPsychology  Studies  -  Studies  in  Psychology  Vol/Volume:  42,  Issue/Issue:  1,  2022Deniz  Sakarya  M,  Cakmak  E\n237  Machine Translated by Google"

(2014)  to  determine  the  factor  structure  \nof  the  scale ,  it  was  seen  that  it  has  a  two-factor  structure:  misophonia  symptoms  \nand  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors .  Again,  in  analyzes  for  construct  validity,  \nthe  Misophonia  Scale's  relationship  with  the  Adult  Sensory  Questionnai  re-ASQ  \n(Adult  Sensory  Questionnai  re-ASQ;  Kinnealey  &  Oliver,  2002,  cited  by  Wu  et  al.,  \n2014)  was  moderate;  the  relationship  with  visual  sensitivity,  olfactory  sensitivity  and  \ntactile  sensitivity  was  found  to  be  low  as  expected.  The  internal  consistency  \ncoefficient  of  the  scale  was  found  to  be  .86  for  misophonia  symptoms  and  misophonia  \nemotion  and  behavior  factors,  and  .89  for  the  whole  scale.In  order  to  evaluate  misophonia  symptoms  in  Turkey,  a  comprehensive  \nmisophonia  symptom  list  was  created  for  the  first  time  in  a  thesis  study  in  the  field  of  \npsychiatry,  and  this  list  was  named  the  “Misophonia  Interview  Scale” (Öz,  2016).  A  \nTurkish  screening  scale  for  differentiating  misophonia  and  other  sound  tolerance  \nproblems  (hyperacusis,  phonophobia)  was  prepared  in  a  doctoral  thesis  study  \nconducted  in  the  field  of  audiology  (Alluÿoÿlu,  2020).  Considering  that  the  lack  of  a  \nmeasurement  tool  that  rapidly  evaluates  misophonia  in  our  country,  whose  validity  \nand  reliability  has  been  tested,  is  an  important  deficiency  for  clinical  applications  and  \npopulation-based  studies,  the  aim  of  this  study  is  to  adapt  the  Misophonia  Scale  \ndeveloped  by  Wu  et  al.  (2014)  into  Turkish.  This  scale  was  developed  to  evaluate  \nthe  symptoms  of  misophonia  and  the  emotions  and  behaviors  that  occur  during  \nexposure  to  triggering  sound.  The  original  scale  consists  of  three  parts:  misophonia  \nsymptoms,  misophonia  feelings  and  behaviors ,  and  misophonia  severity .  In  the  \nmisophonia  symptoms  section,  there  are  seven  specific  sounds  that  people  with  \nmisophonia  are  often  disturbed  by,  such  as  mouth  smacking  and  paper  rustling,  and  \nit  is  questioned  how  sensitive  people  are  to  these  sounds  compared  to  other  people.  \nIn  the  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors  section,  negative  emotions  and  behaviors  \ndeveloped  against  misophonia  symptoms  are  evaluated  (eg,  \"you  have  violent  \nthoughts,  you  feel  anxious  and  distressed\").  In  this  section,  which  consists  of  10  \nquestions  that  include  expressions  of  emotion  and  behavior,  individuals  are  asked  \nto  what  extent  they  develop  the  emotions  and  behaviors  defined  in  the  items  when  \nthey  encounter  a  disturbing  sound.  The  severity  of  misophonia  section  was  created  \nby  adapting  the  items  of  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  Global  Obsessive-\nCom  pulsive  Scale;  Murphy  et  al.,  1982;  cited  in  Wu  et  al.,  2014  to  misophonia.

      "text": "246   Validity  and  Reliability  Test  of  the  Turkish  Version  of  the  Misophonia  Scale\nPsychology  Studies  -  Studies  in  Psychology  Vol/Volume:  42,  Issue/Issue:  1,  2022In  the  exploratory  factor  analysis,  it  was  seen  that  the  scale  was  better  explained  by  the  three-\nfactor  structure,  unlike  the  original  structure.  In  the  factor  analysis  conducted  by  Wu  et  al.  (2014)  \nfor  the  original  scale,  the  existence  of  a  third  factor  was  mentioned  when  the  eigenvalue  and  \nparallel  analysis  method  were  taken  into  account.  The  authors  emphasized  that  although  the  \nscale  is  better  explained  by  the  two-factor  structure,  it  tends  to  have  a  three-factor  structure.  In  \norder  to  discuss  the  accuracy  of  the  three-factor  structure  that  emerged  in  this  study,  Dr.  When  \nWu  was  contacted,  he  stated  that  the  three-factor  structure  of  the  scale  was  appropriate  and  the  \nfactors  were  renamed  and  the  final  version  of  the  scale  was  created.  warn-When  the  split-half  method  was  used,  the  reliability  coefficients  obtained  were  .83  for  the  whole  \nscale  and  .86,  .87  and  .81  for  each  factor.  Finally,  the  reliability  analysis  of  the  scale  was  \nexamined  with  the  test-retest  method.  The  scale  was  re-administered  14  days  after  the  first  \napplication  of  the  scale  to  75  people,  and  the  test-retest  reliability  coefficient  was  calculated  as  \n.78  after  two  applications.According  to  the  results  presented  in  Table  4,  it  is  seen  that  those  with  misophonia  have  \nhigher  scores  than  those  without.  All  differences  between  groups  were  statistically  significant.\nAs  a  result  of  the  item  analysis  of  the  scale,  it  was  seen  that  the  contribution  of  the  item-total  \ncorrelation  coefficients  to  the  Misophonia  Scale  was  sufficient.  When  the  Cronbach's  alpha  \ncoefficients  obtained  by  removing  any  item  from  the  scale  were  examined,  it  was  observed  that  \nthe  original  item  structure  of  the  scale  was  preserved  because  results  were  smaller  than  the  total  \ninternal  consistency  coefficient  of  the  scale.Within  the  scope  of  reliability  analyzes  for  the  Misophonia  Scale,  the  Cronbach  Alpha  \ncoefficient  for  the  internal  consistency  of  the  measurement  was  .89  for  the  whole  scale,  .79  for  \nmisophonia  symptoms,  .85  for  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors  –  avoidance  and  \ninternalization,  and  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors  –  aggression  and  externalization.  It  was  calculated  as  .83.\nIn  this  study,  the  Turkish  adaptation  of  the  Misophonia  Scale  developed  by  Wu  et  al.  (2014)  \nwas  made  in  order  to  evaluate  misophonia,  which  is  frequently  examined  at  the  level  of  case  \nstudies  in  the  literature  and  which  is  needed  as  a  measurement  tool  for  population-based  studies.  \nAs  a  result  of  the  study,  data  supporting  that  the  Misophonia  Scale  is  a  valid  and  reliable  \nmeasurement  tool  were  reached.Reliability  Analysis\nArgumentit  is  valid.Machine Translated by Google"

Since  the  fit  indices  were  found  to  be  acceptable  and  close  to  \nacceptable  in  confirmatory  factor  analysis,  the  three-factor  structure  was  confirmed  by  confirmatory  \nfactor  analysis.  In  addition,  when  the  three-factor  structure  was  compared  with  both  the  single  and  the  \ntwo-factor  structure  in  the  original  scale,  the  three-factor  structure  was  supported.While  the  variance  explained  for  misophonia  symptoms  in  the  original  scale  was  38%,  it  was  similarly  \n37.13%  in  this  study.  While  the  rate  of  variance  explained  by  the  dual  factor  structure  of  the  original  \nscale  was  52.50%,  it  was  47.96%  in  this  study.  The  variance  explained  by  the  three-factor  structure  \nincreases  to  55.52%.  This  finding  shows  that  the  adapted  scale  was  adequately  explained  with  a  \nthree-factor  structure.\nIn  the  current  study,  it  is  thought  that  the  fact  that  individuals'  aggressive  and  externalizing  \nresponses  (eg,  being  physically  aggressive,  verbally  aggressive,  having  violent  thoughts)  are  better  \nexplained  under  a  separate  factor  as  a  result  of  the  triggering  sound  may  be  a  result  of  cultural  \ndifferences.  Although  the  feeling  of  anger  is  universal,  the  expression  of  this  emotion  at  the  level  of  \naggression  may  differ  between  cultures.  For  example,  in  Far  Eastern  societies  where  social  cohesion  \nis  important  and  assertiveness  is  low,  there  is  a  tendency  to  hide  anger  and  express  it  less  openly  \ncompared  to  Western  cultures  where  individuality  is  prominent  (Liu,  2014).  The  display  of  direct  \nphysical  aggression  among  students  is  less  allowed  (Fuji  hara  et  al.,  1999).  Studies  in  which  this  \nscale  will  be  examined  in  different  samples  and  cross-cultural  studies  on  anger  expression  in  Turkey  \nwill  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  this  factor  structure.\nWu  et  al.  (2014)  gave  a  score  of  7  and  above  from  the  question  in  the  last  part  of  the  scale  as  the  \ncut-off  point  for  clinically  significant  misophonia.  In  this  study,  using  this  cut-off  score  for  discriminant  \nvalidity,  the  scale  and  factor  scores  of  individuals  who  were  below  and  above  the  said  score  were  \ncompared.  The  sum  of  misophonia  and  symptoms  of  misophonia  in  those  with  clinically  significant  \nmisophonia  compared  to  those  without,Seven  items  in  the  misophonia  symptoms  factor,  which  is  the  first  factor  of  the  scale,  are  the  same  as  \nin  the  original  study.  However,  items  in  the  misophonia  emotions  and  behaviors  factor  were  loaded  \non  two  separate  factors,  unlike  the  original  scale.  Four  items  in  this  factor  were  loaded  on  a  separate  \nfactor,  thus  forming  the  third  factor  under  the  name  of  misophonia,  emotions  and  behaviors-aggression  \nand  externalization.Machine Translated by Google"

In  both  studies,  the  most  frequently  disturbed  sound  was  repetitive  sounds,  \nwhile  the  second  highest  score  belonged  to  eating  sounds.  In  this  study,  the  highest  score  \nbelongs  to  the  eating  sounds  first  and  then  to  the  repetitive  sounds.\nAlthough  this  single  assessment  in  the  last  section,  which  was  not  included  in  the  Misophonia  \nScale  scoring,  seems  to  yield  higher  results,  in  any  case,  misophonia  was  detected  at  a  higher  \nrate  in  the  Turkish  sample  than  in  the  literature.  The  higher  symptom  rates  detected  by  the  \nMisophonia  Scale  may  be  due  to  the  higher  number  of  individuals  with  misophonia  in  the  \nTurkish  sample.  Another  explanation  may  be  that  the  way  individuals  express  their  discomfort  \nis  culturally  different.  Öz  (2016)  Turkish  sample-In  the  study,  internal  consistency,  split-half  and  test-retest  methods  were  used  to  examine  \nthe  reliability  of  the  scale.  The  Cronbach  alpha  internal  consistency  coefficient  was  found  to  be  \n.89,  and  the  results  are  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  original  scale  (Wu  et  al.,  2014)  and  the  \nresults  of  the  Chinese  adaptation  study  (Zhou  et  al.,  2017).  The  high  internal  consistency  \ncoefficient  in  the  current  study,  along  with  a  halving  reliability  coefficient  of  .83  and  a  test-retest  \ncorrelation  coefficient  of  .78,  support  that  the  Turkish  version  of  the  Misophonia  Scale  is  a  \nreliable  measurement  tool.\nIn  case  studies  (Edelstein  et  al.,  2013;  Tunç  &  Baÿbuÿ,  2017)  and  some  large  sample  studies  \n(Jager  et  al,  2020a;  Schröder  et  al.,  2013),  the  biggest  triggers  for  individuals  with  misophonia  \nare  eating,  chewing,  and  smacking  sound.  appears  to  be.  Although  the  results  show  parallelism,  \nthe  rate  of  discomfort  for  these  two  items  in  this  study  is  quite  high  compared  to  other  studies  \nusing  the  same  scale.  It  is  estimated  that  the  possible  reason  for  this  may  be  related  to  the  \nincidence  of  misophonia  in  the  Turkish  sample.  Although  the  prevalence  of  misophonia  is  not  \nfully  known  in  the  literature,  Wu  et  al.  (2014)  expressed  clinically  significant  misophonia  in  \nuniversity  students  as  19.9%  and  Zhou  et  al.  (2017)  as  .16.6%  when  evaluated  with  the  \nMisophonia  Scale;  In  the  current  study,  this  rate  was  found  to  be  38%  with  the  same  scale.\nJastreboff  and  Jastreboff  (2014)  estimate  the  rate  of  clinically  significant  misophonia,  which  \nthey  predict  from  the  data  of  individuals  with  sound  tolerance  problems,  to  be  approximately  3.2%.The  fact  that  misophonia  feelings  and  behaviors-avoidance  and  internalization,  misophonia  \nemotions  and  behaviors-aggression  and  externalization  factors  had  a  higher  average  was  \naccepted  as  evidence  for  the  discriminant  validity  of  the  scale.Machine Translated by Google"

In  future  studies,  it  may  be  recommended  to  \nexamine  the  effectiveness  of  the  cut-off  point  by  applying  the  scale  to  individuals  diagnosed  with  \nmisophonia  according  to  clinical  diagnostic  criteria.  In  addition,  since  there  were  no  individuals  \ndiagnosed  with  misophonia  in  this  study,  its  criterion-related  validity  could  be  examined  by  an  \nexpert  on  people  who  were  clinically  diagnosed  with  misophonia  in  future  studies.is.\nThere  are  some  limitations  of  the  research.  The  validity  and  reliability  test  of  this  scale,  as  in  \nthe  original  version  (Wu  et  al.,  2014),  was  conducted  only  with  university  students,  and  its  \ngeneralizability  is  limited.  It  is  thought  that  it  would  be  appropriate  to  test  the  scale  in  a  larger  \nsample  of  all  ages  and  education  levels  in  future  studies.  Since  there  is  no  other  Turkish  \nmeasurement  tool  that  measures  misophonia,  an  examination  of  its  convergent  validity  could  not  \nbe  made  in  this  study.  The  fact  that  the  relationship  between  the  Misophonia  Scale  and  other  \nmeasurement  tools  evaluating  the  structures  related  to  misophonia  was  not  evaluated  in  this  \nstudy  is  among  the  limitations.  In  future  studies,  additional  findings  for  validity  can  be  obtained  by  \nexamining  the  relationship  of  the  Misophonia  Scale  with  the  measurement  tools  that  measure  \nmisophonia  or  problems  related  to  misophonia.\nAs  a  result,  results  supporting  that  the  Misophonia  Scale  is  a  valid  and  reliable  measurement  \ntool  in  evaluating  misophonia  have  been  reached.  This  scale  will  contribute  to  the  dissemination  \nof  population-based  studies  that  will  provide  a  better  understanding  of  misophonia  in  our  country  \nand  to  the  evaluation  of  misophonia  in  the  clinical  setting.Although  he  found  the  misophonia  rate  to  be  7.7  in  his  study,  misophonia  was  evaluated  \naccording  to  the  diagnostic  criteria  developed  by  the  researcher.  Despite  the  increase  in  studies  \non  misophonia,  it  is  stated  that  there  is  a  generalization  and  comparison  problem  between  \nresearch  results  due  to  the  difference  in  evaluating  misophonia  (Siepsiak  et  al.,  2020).
