JASTREBOFF2\n1Department of Otolaryngology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA\n2JHDF, Inc., Ellicott City, MD, USA\nINTRODUCTION\nDecreased sound tolerance, diplacousis, and polyacousis\nare dysfunctions of auditory perception. Decreased\nsound tolerance can be subdivided into hyperacusisand misophonia ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2002,\n2013). While both phenomena are frequently observed\nin otolaryngologic and audiologic clinics, our knowledgeof decreased sound tolerance is very limited and its pro-posed mechanisms are unproven and speculative. Never-theless, available information suggests that decreased\nsound tolerance results from dysfunction of the central\nauditory pathways and their connections with the centralnervous system rather than from dysfunction of theinner ear.\nThere is no consensus on the testing of decreased\nsound tolerance. Limited information is availableregarding normative data for loudness discomfort levels(LDLs), which are typically used to assess the presence\nof hyperacusis ( Sherlock and Formby, 2005 ). Question-\nnaires have been proposed to evaluate hyperacusis sever-\nity (Khalfa et al., 2002; Dauman and Bouscau-Faure,\n2005 ); however, their validity needs to be confirmed.\nMoreover, the questionnaires do not address the pres-ence and extent of misophonia. Reported data on theprevalence and epidemiology of hyperacusis are highlydiverse. Hyperacusis can occur alone or as an adjunct\nto complex medical conditions ( Jastreboff and\nJastreboff, 2009 ). In spite of all the limitations listed\nabove, the treatment of decreased sound tolerance can\nbe highly successful ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2000,\n2013; Jastreboff and Hazell, 2004; Formby, 2007;Formby et al., 2007 ).Diplacousis was first reported in 1907 by Shambaugh,\nSr. (Albers and Wilson, 1968a ) and is much less fre-\nquently diagnosed than decreased sound tolerance.Diplacousis occurs when a subject who is exposed to asingle-frequency tone perceives multiple tones, rough-ness, and beats ( Ward, 1952, 1955; Flottorp, 1953;\nZurek, 1981; Bacon and Viemeister, 1985 ).\nA characteristic feature of diplacousis is that the distor-tions are perceived only for low levels of sound. Whenthe intensity of the external tone increases, the distor-\ntions disappear and the subject perceives a single pure\ntone. The mechanism of diplacousis is linked to dysfunc-tion of the inner ear ( Knight, 2004 ), and only single\nreports link it to dysfunction of the central auditory path-ways ( Ghosh, 1990 ). Polyacousis occurs when more than\ntwo tones are perceived. This term is seldom used andonly one paper on the subject can be found in MedLine(Corliss et al., 1968 ). An internet search, using various\nsearch engines, yielded no hits for polyacousis.\nDEFINITIONS\nA variety of terms (e.g., hyperacousia, auditory hyperes-thesia, recruitment, dysacousis, auditory dysesthesia,odynacusis, and auditory allodynia) (Baguley and\nMcFerran, 2010 ) have been proposed to describe\ndecreased sound tolerance, with the word“hyperacusis” used most frequently ( Jastreboff and\nJastreboff, 2004 ). One approach proposes further divid-\ning hyperacusis into loudness hyperacusis, annoyancehyperacusis, and fear hyperacusis ( Tyler et al., 2009 ).\nStedman’s Medical Dictionary defines hyperacusis as\n“Abnormal acuteness of hearing due to increased\n*Correspondence to: Pawel J.

      "text": "irritability of the sensory neural mechanism. Syn: audi-\ntory hyperesthesia,” with hyperesthesia defined as\n“Abnormal acuteness of sensitivity to touch, pain, orother sensory stimuli” ( Anon., 1997 ).American Heritage\nDictionary defines hyperacusis as “An abnormal or\npathological increase in sensitivity to sensory stimuli,[as of the skin to touch or] the ear to sound”(Anon., 1994 ).\nThe definitions promoted in this chapter are based on\nreports from patients and on potential physiologic mech-anisms, in which the auditory system (both peripheraland central parts) and the limbic and autonomic nervoussystems are the main systems involved. An analysis ofthe negative reactions of subjects who suffer fromdecreased sound tolerance points to the involvementof the limbic and autonomic nervous systems in casesof clinically significant decreased sound tolerance\n(i.e., where a subject’s difficulty with this condition is\nsubstantial enough to seek professional help). A widespectrum of emotional reactions is observed (e.g., dis-comfort, dislike, distress, annoyance, anxiety, and fear),as well as a variety of negative sensations (e.g., pain,physical discomfort, fullness in the ear) and reactionsassociated with the overstimulation of the sympatheticpart of the autonomic nervous system (e.g., anxiety,\npanic, decreased ability to enjoy life activities, sleep\nproblems, problem with digestion) ( Jastreboff and\nHazell, 2004; Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2004, 2009,2013; Schroder et al., 2013 ).\nDecreased sound tolerance is defined as present when\na subject exhibits negative reactions when exposed tosound that would not evoke the same response in anaverage listener ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2002, 2013;\nJastreboff and Hazell, 2004 ). These negative reactions\ncan be observed when the subject is exposed to low-,\nmoderate-, or high-level sound. The notion that sound\nmust be loud, or louder than a certain level, is not a pre-requisite for, and is not used as a criterion to, diagnosedecreased sound tolerance. A patient’s negative reac-\ntions may occur in response to any (including low) level\nof sound. It is postulated that decreased sound tolerance\nconsists of two components: hyperacusis and misopho-\nnia, which frequently occur together.\nHyperacusis is defined as present when negative reac-\ntions to a sound depend only on its physical characteris-\ntics (i.e., its spectrum and intensity). The sound’s\nmeaning and the context in which it occurs are irrelevant\n(Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2002, 2013; Jastreboff and\nHazell, 2004 ).\nMisophonia is defined as an abnormally strong reac-\ntion to a sound with a specific pattern and meaning to a\ngiven subject. The physical characteristics of the soundare secondary. Reactions to the sound depend on the sub-ject’s past history and on non-auditory factors such asthe subject’s previous evaluation of the sound, his/her\nbelief that the sound is a potential threat or that exposure\nto it will be harmful, the subject’s psychologic profile,and the context in which the sound is presented(Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2002, 2013; Jastreboff and\nHazell, 2004 ). The strength of the reaction is only par-\ntially determined by the sound’s physical characteristics.A specific category of misophonia occurs when fear isthe dominant emotion and patients are afraid of the\nsound (i.e., phonophobia: phobia ¼fear) ( Jastreboff\nand Jastreboff, 2002, 2013; Jastreboff and Hazell, 2004 ).\nNeither hyperacusis nor misophonia has any relation\nto the threshold of hearing, which can be normal or can\ninvolve hearing loss. Therefore, the term “recruitment”is not related to decreased sound tolerance. Recruitmentrefers to an unusually rapid growth of loudness asthe level of a tone is increased. It occurs in association\nwith hearing loss and is a purely cochlear-based phenom-\nenon ( Moore, 1995 ). Recruitment might coexist with\ndecreased sound tolerance, but there is no functional linkbetween the two conditions ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff,\n2004 ). Out of 740 patients treated at the Emory Tinnitus\nand Hyperacusis Center, during the first visit 497patients reported a problem with decreased sound toler-ance and 73% of patients in this group reported a prob-\nlem with hearing as well. A total of 126 patients (17%)\nhad hyperacusis that required specific treatment andout of that group of patients, 84 (67%) had concurrentproblems with hearing. On the other hand, 476 out of740 patients (64%) reported a problem with hearing. Inall, 362 patients (76%) from this group also reported aproblem with decreased sound tolerance and 70 patients(15%) required specific treatment for hyperacusis.\nThere is more than one definition of diplacousis (the\nspelling “diplacusis” is also used). One of the older def-initions is that diplacousis is a perception of rough ornoisy sound, or the perception of two or more soundswhen a subject is exposed to a single pure tone ( Ward,\n1952). Currently, diplacousis is defined as an “abnormal\nperception of sound either in time or in pitch, such thatone sound is heard as two” ( Anon., 1997 ). The name orig-\ninates from a combination of two Greek words: diplous ,\nmeaning double and akousis , meaning hearing. While\nspecific epidemiologic studies are lacking, it is believedthat diplacousis is present in many people; however, ifthe pitch difference is less than a half-tone and the sub-ject does not have musical training it is not noticed.Diplacousis predominantly affects musicians as theyare often trained to distinguish between small pitch\ndifferences.\nA broader definition is that diplacousis is present\nwhen exposure to a pure tone results in the perception\nof several tones in addition to the presented tone(Ward, 1955 ). A tone may be perceived as harmonics376 P.J. JASTREBOFF AND M.M. JASTREBOFF"

      "text": "of a fundamental sound or the subject’s voice ( Brookler,\n2009 ). Diplacousis depends on the frequency of the\nevoking sound ( Brookler, 2009 ) and on the sound’s\nintensity. When the intensity increases, diplacousis\ndecreases ( Burns, 1982 ).\nSeveral subtypes of diplacousis can be distinguished\n(Bauman, 2013 ). Diplacousis binauralis occurs when one\nsound is perceived dissimilarly in each ear and may dif-fer in pitch or in time. Diplacousis dysharmonica occurs\nwhen the sound is perceived normally in one ear and at a\ndifferent pitch in the other ear (i.e., an interaural pitchdifference (IPD)). Diplacousis echoica occurs whenexposure to a sound results in the perception of thesound followed by the repetition or echo of the sound.Diplacousis monauralis occurs when exposure to asound results in the perception of two different soundsin one ear. Diplacousis dysharmonica/IPD ( d\nL)is the\nmost common type of diplacousis. IPD is defined asd\nL¼(fR/C0fL)/fL¼fR/fL/C01, where fR/fLdenotes the fre-\nquencies at the left and right ear, obtained by the adjust-ment of either frequency to achieve the pitch match(Terhardt, 2000 ). Diplacousis is typically associated with\nhearing loss. A variety of presumed mechanisms fordiplacousis are associated with its different subtypesand are discussed below.\nPolyacousis is a specific case of diplacousis that\noccurs when more than two tones are perceived. Thisterm is rarely used.\nDECREASED SOUND TOLERANCE\n(HYPERACUSIS AND MISOPHONIA),\nDIPLACOUSIS, AND POLYACOUSIS AS A\nPROBLEM\nDecreased sound tolerance can have an extremely strongimpact on patients’ lives. Any sound can become offen-sive and evoke a negative reaction. With hyperacusis,any sound which is louder than acceptable to a patientevokes negative reactions. For misophonia, a broad vari-ety of sounds have been reported to create problems.These sounds can be loud or soft, such as street sounds,\ncar brakes, lawnmower, vacuum cleaner, garbage dis-\nposal, flushing toilet, cutlery and plates, keys rattling,hair dryer, school bell, announcements in a metro stationor on a train or airplane, typing on a computer keyboard,the sound of a computer, refrigerator, supermarketfreezer, the hum of electricity, a swimming-pool pump,shoveling cement, a husband/wife breathing in bed, snor-ing, sounds of eating, one’s own voice, a crying baby, a\nmusical instrument, singing, other people’s headphones,\nfetal heart sounds, or the sound of drawing with a felt-tipped pen ( Hazell et al., 2002; Jastreboff and Jastreboff,\n2004, 2013 ). On the other hand, sounds such as bird song,running water, wind, and rain are rarely reported as neg-\native ( Hazell et al., 2002 ).\nDecreased sound tolerance can prevent people from\nworking and interacting socially. In extreme cases,\npatients do not leave their homes, and their lives and theirfamily’s lives revolve around (and are controlled by) theavoidance of offensive sounds. Misophonia evokes thesame reactions as hyperacusis and further enhancesthe effects of hyperacusis.\nDiplacousis and polyacousis are rare and are infre-\nquently reported as causing a problem for subjectswho experience them. The exception is some musicians,as diplacousis may have an impact on their ability towork by decreasing their perception of music ( Kaharit\net al., 2003; Jansen et al., 2009 ).Jansen et al. (2009) per-\nformed a study on 241 professional musicians in a sym-phony orchestra, aged from 23 to 64 years, and assessed\ntheir hearing loss and other hearing-related complaints.\nThey found that musicians often complained abouthyperacusis and tinnitus (79% and 51%, respectively),while diplacousis diagnosed by the presence of IPD >1%\nwas measured in 44% of musicians, but reported as aproblem for only 7%. Interestingly, 24% of subjects com-plained about the distortion of tones.\nConsidering that differences in pitch sensation\nbetween 1.6% and 2.3% are common in non-musicians(Brink van den, 1970; Burns, 1982 ), it is notable in this\nstudy of diplacousis that IPD larger than 2% was\nobserved in 18% of subjects and IPD larger than 3%\nwas present in 3% of subjects.\nJansen et al. (2009) reported only a few very sensitive\npeople who experienced diplacousis. This postulate is\nfurther corroborated by their finding that, when the sub-\njective results on diplacousis were compared to the\nresults of diplacousis matching, no significant correla-tion was found for any of the tested frequencies. Conse-quently, even when diplacousis is documented by IPD, itmay neither be noticed nor create a problem, even formusicians.\nKaharit et al. (2003) evaluated 139 rock/jazz musi-\ncians for hearing disorders ( Table 21.1 ). The presence\nof tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion, or diplacousis wasestablished by the subject’s answers on a questionnaire.The authors defined tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion,and diplacousis in the following non-standard manner:\nTinnitus was defined as a spontaneous or evokedsensation of sounds, e.g. ringing or buzzing, oftencombined with pure tones that occur in theabsence of an external sound source. The differentsounds could be uni- or bilaterally located in theears, or experienced and located somewhere inthe head. Hyperacusis was defined as hypersensi-\ntivity to the loudness of sounds, including aDECREASED SOUND TOLERANCE 377"

Distortionwas defined as frequencies, overtones and/or har-monics that were not experienced in their trueoriginal form but as distorted, unclear, fuzzyand out of tune. Diplacusis was defined as a path-ological matching of frequency and pitch that may\ninvolve dissonance or a sudden change of pitch\nwhen a change in loudness occurs.\nOn the basis of audiometry and the questionnaire, to\ndetermine the presence of hearing loss the subjects were\nfirst divided into two subgroups: those who were notaffected by tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion, or dipla-cousis ( n¼36 or 26%) and those who were affected by\nat least one of these disorders ( n¼103 or 74%). The latter\ngroup was further subdivided into a group that had oneof these disorders and a group that had more than one\ndisorder, as shown in Table 21.1 .\nHearing disorders have been observed in 74% of sub-\njects, with tinnitus, hyperacusis, distortion, and dipla-\ncousis reported either as a single or combined disorder\n(Table 21.1 ).\nDIAGNOSIS\nDiagnosis of decreased sound tolerance is complex\nand there is no agreement on how it should be done.\nFor hyperacusis, there is a general agreement thatp u r e - t o n eL D L sm u s th a v ed e c r e a s e dv a l u e s .L o wvalues by themselves, however, do not prove the pres-ence of hyperacusis as these values may be due tomisophonia.\nThere is no consensus on how LDLs should be evalu-\nated. Varied results depend on the specific method\nused to administer LDLs (e.g., stimuli: pure tone, warble\ntone, noise; presentation: free field, insert earphones,headphones) and the instructions given to patients(Hawkins et al., 1987; Byrne and Dirks, 1996; Ricketts\nand Bentler, 1996; Cox et al., 1997; Sherlock and\nFormby, 2005 ). Several studies indicate LDLs are in\nthe range of 90–110 dB sound pressure level (SPL) in\nthe normal population. The results tend to cluster within95–110 dB SPL for frequencies from 500 to 8000 Hz,which corresponds to approximately 90–100 dB hearinglevel (HL) ( Hood and Poole, 1966; Stephens and\nAnderson, 1971; Sherlock and Formby, 2005 ). A study\naimed specifically at this issue showed that the averageLDL value for subjects who do not have a sound toler-ance problem was 100 dB HL ( Sherlock and Formby,\n2005 ). The study has been performed on 59 adults with\nnormal hearing and no problem with sound tolerance. Inaddition to evaluating LDLs, loudness growth functionwas measured by categoric scaling judgments on a sub-group of 18 subjects. There were no differences betweenabsolute (LDL) and relative (categoric scaling) judgmentof loudness discomfort, intersubject variability, or intra-subject test–retest reliability. The authors concluded thatadministering LDLs to estimate loudness discomfort is\nan efficient and valid clinical measure to characterize\nthe “threshold of discomfort.”\nWhen hyperacusis is present, LDLs are lower, typi-\ncally in the 60–85 dB HL range ( Jastreboff and\nJastreboff, 2002 ). In cases of pure misophonia, LDL\nvalues from 30 to 120 dB HL can be observed. Therefore,LDLs alone are insufficient to diagnose hyperacusis ormisophonia, and a specific detailed interview is crucial\nto diagnose and assess the relative contribution of hyper-\nacusis and misophonia to decreased sound tolerance.Notably, hyperacusis and misophonia frequently occurtogether. Indeed, misophonia is inevitable in cases ofsevere hyperacusis. However, misophonia does notinduce hyperacusis.\nWhen interviewing prospective patients, it is impor-\ntant for the clinician to identify sounds that evoke neg-\native reactions as well as sounds that are well tolerated in\norder to detect any discrepancies between reactions andthe intensity of the sound. While a patient with normalLDLs does not have hyperacusis, decreased sound toler-ance can still be present due to misophonia. Conse-quently, diagnosis of decreased sound tolerance issubjective and based predominantly on the patient’sreport.\nTo decrease the impact of misophonia on LDLs, we\npromote a modification of the standard procedure foradministering LDLs ( Hood and Poole, 1966 ) so that\nthe results are dominated by hyperacusis and the effectsTable 21.1\nType of hearing disorders reported in 103 affected musicians\nGroups of single or\n>1 hearing disorderHearing lossn(%) Tinnitus n(%)Hyperacusisn(%) Distortion n(%)Diplacusisn(%)\nSingle hearing disorder 11 (10.7) 7 (6.8) 9 (8.7) 1 (1) 0 (0)\n>1 Hearing disorder 57 (55.3) 60 (58.3) 54 (52.4) 24 (23.3) 4 (3.9)\nData modified from Kaharit et al.

To achieve this, patients are\nprovided full control during testing and given the powerto stop it at any time ( Jastreboff et al., 1996; Jastreboff\nand Jastreboff, 2004 ).\nThere are no established and validated questionnaires\nto determine the severity of decreased sound tolerance.Two questionnaires have been proposed to assess theextent of hyperacusis – the Hyperacusis Questionnaire\n(Table 21.2 )(Khalfa et al., 2002 ) and the Multiple-\nActivity Scale for Hyperacusis (MASH) ( Table 21.3 )(Dauman and Bouscau-Faure, 2005 ) – but their specific-\nity and selectivity need to be further evaluated. The\nHyperacusis Questionnaire was created by testing thatwas performed only on the general population ofsubjects who did not complain of hyperacusis. The ques-tionnaire focuses on the psychologic and social aspectsof hearing rather than on an indication of hyperacusis.Only four of 14 questions (rated on a scale from 1 to 4)are related to hyperacusis while the remaining questions\nappear to be related to other aspects, including hearing\nloss (“5. Do you have difficulty listening to conversa-tions in noisy places?”) ( Khalfa et al., 2002 ). MASH\nconsists of a list of 14 activities, and patients are askedto indicate their level of annoyance related to a givenactivity on a scale from 0 to 10 ( Dauman and\nBouscau-Faure, 2005 ). Both questionnaires have been\nreported to be effective in the evaluation of hyperacu-\nsis, but interestingly, there was no correlation of their\nscores with audiologic measurements of discomfortlevels (i.e., LDL and speech discomfort level)(Dauman and Bouscau-Faure, 2005 ). Notably, neither\nof these questionnaires differentiates between hypera-cusis and misophonia. There is no validated question-naire for misophonia.\nDiagnosis of diplacousis and polyacousis is based on\nan interview with the patient and on pitch matching of\nTable 21.2\nKhalfa’s Hyperacusis Questionnaire\nSurname, first name:\nSex:Age:\nProfession or studies:\nPlace (town or area) of residence:Telephone:Are you or have you been exposed to noise?\nDo you tolerate noise less well as compared to a few years ago?\nHave you ever had hearing problems?

(2009) used an adaptive procedure to com-\npare the pitch of pure tones presented alternatively to the\nright and left ear by headphones using three differentfrequencies: 1, 2, and 4 kHz. Specifically, in the firststep, subjects were asked to match the loudness of a tonein the left ear to a 60-dB HL tone presented in the rightear using increments of 1 dB. Subjects were then asked to\nmatch the pitch of the tone in the left ear to that in the\nright ear using increments of 1 Hz. The procedure wasrepeated by alternating ears and changing the frequencyof the test tone. The result of diplacousis matching wasdetermined by the deviation between the ears and wasexpressed as a percentage of the measured frequency(Jansen et al., 2009 ). There are no reported methods to\nassess the severity and impact of diplacousis and polya-\ncousis on a patient’s life; severity is judged only on the\nbasis of the patient’s report.\nPREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe lack of an objective method to determine the pres-\nence of decreased sound tolerance and the variety of epi-\ndemiologically oriented questionnaires used to do soyield limited data on the prevalence of decreased soundtolerance in the general population. Notably, the dataobtained from 10 349 randomly selected subjects showedthat 15.3% reported hyperacusis ( Fabijanska et al., 1999 ).\nDiagnosis of hyperacusis is made even more complexbecause LDL measurements are not part of a routine\naudiologic evaluation. Moreover, a careful inspection\nof the reports revealed that, in some cases, misophoniarather than hyperacusis was present (e.g., reports onWilliams syndrome) ( Klein et al., 1990; Blomberg\net al., 2006).\nAn estimation of the prevalence of decreased sound\ntolerance can be obtained by analyzing its co-appearancewith tinnitus, and more detailed and extensive data are\navailable in that regard. Approximately 60% of tinnitus\npatients have significant decreased sound tolerance. Ofthese, about 30% of patients suffer from hyperacusisand require treatment for it ( Jastreboff et al., 1999;\nJastreboff and Jastreboff, 2002; Jastreboff and Hazell,2004 ). Since, on average, the prevalence of bothersome\ntinnitus reported in the literature is about 4% ( Hoffman\nand Reed, 2004 ), it is possible to estimate that 1.2% of the\ngeneral population has tinnitus and hyperacusis. On theother hand, it has been reported that 86% of patients withhyperacusis suffer from tinnitus ( Anari et al., 1999 ). It is\ntherefore possible to calculate that 14% of subjectswith hyperacusis (i.e., 0.56% of the general population)do not have tinnitus. Taking the above informationinto account, it is possible to estimate that clinicallysignificant hyperacusis exists in approximately 1.75%\nof the general population. As the data indicate that about\nhalf the patients with decreased sound tolerance havehyperacusis, the prevalence of decreased sound toler-ance in the general population can be estimated at 3.5%.\nLimited data exist on the prevalence of diplacousis\nand polyacousis. A wide variety of ototoxic factors havebeen linked to diplacousis, with noise exposure being themost common ( Albers and Wilson, 1968b ). Nevertheless,\nclinical observations indicate that diplacousis is reportedinfrequently, and mainly by musicians or people towhom the accurate perception of music is crucial fortheir work. To date, only a couple of studies in the liter-ature report on the epidemiology of diplacousis and bothstudies analyze the population of musicians. In the firststudy, performed on 139 rock/jazz musicians anddescribed earlier in this chapter, 4 subjects (2.9%)\nreported diplacousis ( Kaharit et al., 2003 ). A more recent\nstudy of diplacousis prevalence amongst 241 symphony\norchestra musicians revealed that diplacousis was gener-ally not reported as a problem and affected only 7% ofsubjects ( Jansen et al., 2009 ). Subjects in this study\nmainly complained about tinnitus and hyperacusis.A total of 79% of the musicians complained about hyper-acusis, 51% complained about tinnitus, and 24% com-\nplained about tone distortion ( Jansen et al., 2009 ).\nInterestingly, while only 7% of the musicians perceived\nan interaural difference in pitch perception as a problem,the results of diplacousis matching revealed that 18%experienced an IPD of more than 2%. Notably, the sub-jective perception of diplacousis did not correlate withthe extent of differences in pitch matching and therewas no difference between males and females with\nregard to the subjective rating of diplacousis ( Jansen\net al., 2009 ).\nMECHANISMS\nThe mechanisms of hyperacusis are speculative. The lackof an animal model of hyperacusis makes it difficult to\nprove the validity of any postulated mechanisms respon-sible for this condition. Existing theories suggest apotential involvement of both peripheral and/or centralmechanisms ( Wrinch, 1909; Jastreboff and Jastreboff,\n2004; Baguley and Andersson, 2007; Niu et al., 2013 ).\nAt the peripheral level, the abnormal enhancement of\ncochlear basilar membrane vibration by the outer hair\ncells (OHCs) might result in the overstimulation of the\ninner hair cells, and therefore result in hyperacusis(Jastreboff, 1990; Jastreboff and Hazell, 2004 ). Indeed,\nin rare cases, it is possible to observe high-amplitudedistortion product otoacoustic emissions and distortionproducts evoked by low-level primaries ( Jastreboff\nand Mattox, 1998 ).

      "text": "hyperacusis would indicate a peripheral mechanism\nbecause the involvement of central mechanisms would\nmore likely act similarly on both sides. However, innearly all cases decreased sound tolerance is symmetric,which argues against the dominant role of the peripheralmechanisms ( Jastreboff et al., 1999 ).\nSubstantial data support the presence of central\nmechanisms in hyperacusis. Animal research has shownthat damage to the cochlea or a decrease in auditory\ninput results in a decrease of the response threshold in\na significant proportion of neurons in the ventralcochlear nucleus and inferior colliculus ( Boettcher and\nSalvi, 1993 ). Studies on evoked potentials indicate an\nabnormal increase of gain in the auditory pathways after\nsuch manipulations are applied ( Gerken, 1993 ). The\nnotion of increased gain within the central part of the\nauditory pathways has been discussed and promoted in\nrecent approaches to the mechanisms of tinnitus and\nhyperacusis ( Norena and Farley, 2013 ).\nA number of medical conditions have been linked to\ndecreased sound tolerance (e.g., tinnitus, Williams syn-drome, Bell’s palsy, Lyme disease, Ramsay Hunt syn-drome, poststapedectomy, perilymphatic fistula, headinjury, migraine, depression, withdrawal from benzodi-azepines, cerebrospinal fluid high pressure, Addison’s\ndisease, translabyrinthine excision of a vestibular\nschwannoma) ( Adour and Wingerd, 1974; Klein et al.,\n1990; Wayman et al., 1990; Lader, 1994; Nields et al.,1999; Gopal et al., 2000; Jastreboff and Hazell, 2004;Blomberg et al., 2006 ). These conditions can be linked\nto the central processing of signals and to the modifica-tion of the level of neuromodulators as possible factorsthat induce or enhance hyperacusis. Moreover, sero-\ntonin has been implicated in hyperacusis on the basis\nof indirect reasoning that some conditions occur withhyperacusis as a symptom (e.g., migraine, depression,pyridoxine deficiency, benzodiazepine dependence,and postviral fatigue syndrome) and involve a distur-bance in serotonin activity ( Marriage and Barnes,\n1995). These authors speculated that, as serotonin is\nconsidered to have an inhibitory role in sensory modula-\ntion at a central level, a reduction in forebrain serotonin\nactivity is therefore the most likely underlying pathologythat causes central hyperacusis. The authors have notproposed any more specific mechanisms of serotonininvolvement, and have stated that the increase ordecrease of serotonin may be linked to hyperacusis.Additionally, they labeled decreased sound toleranceas hyperacusis, with stress on phonophobia, which may\nhave different mechanisms than hyperacusis, and is\ninconsistent with current classifications ( Jastreboff\nand Jastreboff, 2002, 2013; Tyler et al., 2009 ).\nSerotonin involvement in hyperacusis has not been\nconfirmed. There is only one case presentation whichsupports the proposed hypothesis by showing an\nimprovement in hyperacusis, difficulty understanding\nspeech, withdrawn depression, lethargy, and hypersensi-tivity to touch, pressure, and light after following treat-ment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( Gopal\net al., 2000 ).\nA high prevalence of decreased sound tolerance in\npeople with Williams syndrome (over 80%) suggests agenetic basis of decreased sound tolerance in those sub-\njects ( Nigam and Samuel, 1994; Gothelf et al., 2006 ).\nThe mechanisms of misophonia could involve the\nenhancement of the functional links between the auditory\nand limbic systems at both the cognitive and subconsciouslevels ( Jastreboff, 1990; Jastreboff and Hazell, 2004 ).\nAlternatively, a tonic high level of activation of the limbicand autonomic nervous systems may result in strongbehavioral reactions to moderate sounds ( Jastreboff and\nHazell, 2004 ). A recent study supported the proposed\nmechanisms ofmisophoniabyshowing theenhancedauto-nomicreactivitytoasound,butnottoothersensorystimuliin misophonic patients ( Edelstein et al., 2013 ). In January\n2013, Schroder et al. redefined misophonia based on theirwork in a psychiatric center and proposed to classify thecondition as a new psychiatric disorder. In our opinion,Schroder et al. studied a population of psychiatric patients\nwho happened to have misophonia as well. In our clinical\nwork, we have seen 318 misophonic patients (compared to42 cases reported by Schroder et al.), all evaluated by phy-sicians, and in only 7 cases (2.2%) did patients exhibit psy-chiatric problems. Moreover, our misophonic patientsshowedsignificant improvement when treated with a com-bination of counseling and a specific version of soundtherapy (described below), without any need for psychiat-\nric intervention.\nThe mechanisms of diplacousis are hypothetic.\nNearly all the proposed mechanisms of diplacousis\ninvolve the cochlea, and only one paper describes dipla-cousis of (presumably) central origin linked to a lesion inthe posterior thalamus ( Ghosh, 1990 ). The first class of\nproposed mechanisms links diplacousis to hearing lossand OHC damage in the cochlea. OHCs work as a\nmechanical amplifier within the cochlea and are respon-\nsible for sharp tuning of the traveling wave in thecochlea. Notably, the OHCs amplify sounds of lowerintensities only – below 60 dB SPL – which correspondsroughly to half the dynamic range of hearing. OHCs pro-vide gradually less amplification when the level of asound increases and become inactive for sound intensi-ties higher than 60 dB SPL.\nThe mechanism for diplacousis linked to hearing loss\nis discussed below. The hypothesis is based on basic sci-ence regarding the functioning of the cochlea and themechanisms of pitch perception.

      "text": "membrane and the frequency of tone that evokes it. Neu-\nronal activity in the auditory nerve is correlated with the\nphase of the incoming pure tone only for frequenciesbelow 1000 Hz. For higher frequencies, the place onthe basilar membrane where the maximal amplitude ofthe traveling wave develops determines the perceivedpitch ( Moore, 1995 ). When a group of OHCs is damaged,\nthe tuning curve becomes broader and its peak shifts infrequency. When compared to an ear with undamaged\nOHCs for this specific frequency region, the shift in\nplace occurs where maximal stimulation of the basilarmembrane occurs. Consequently, the subject perceivesa different pitch in one ear than in the other ear. Notethat, as OHCs do not function for sound intensitieshigher than 60 dB SPL, diplacousis based on this mech-anism decreases with the increase of a sound’s intensityand disappears when the intensity exceeds 60 dB SPL.\nDiplacousis may or may not appear depending on the\ndifference in the damage of OHC systems in one ear ver-sus the other ear for a given frequency range.\nThis theory explains the clinical observation that\ndiplacousis is particularly linked to unilateral/asymmet-ric hearing loss, the intensity of a sound to which a sub-ject is exposed, and the relation of the affected pitch tothe regions of hearing loss. The theory also explains\ninstances of temporal or permanent diplacousis evoked\nby a loud noise, as reported in the literature ( Knight,\n2004; Jansen et al., 2009 ). The temporal dysfunction\nof OHCs occurs following exposure to a loud noise(i.e., the cilia of the OHC becomes disorganized, makinga cell temporarily dysfunctional). Depending on theasymmetry of damage and pre-existing damage of theOHC system, diplacousis may temporarily appear. If\nthe exposure to a sound results in permanent damage\nto a group of OHCs, permanent diplacousis emerges.Local damage of OHCs causes a loss of sharp tuningof stimulation of IHCs and a shift of frequency wheremaximal stimulation occurs. This results in the percep-tion of a different frequency than the one to which thesubject is exposed ( Fig. 21.1 ). Broadening of the curve\nmay result in the perception of a fuzzy sound.\nA question arises regarding the mechanisms of dipla-\ncousis in subjects without hearing loss. First, a normalaudiogram can be seen in subjects who lost up to 30%of their OHCs ( Harding and Bohne, 2007, 2009; Chen\net al., 2008 ), and yet for these subjects the proposed\nmechanisms described above are still applicable. Anevaluation of the functional status of OHCs by high-frequency resolution distortion product otoacoustic\nemissions (DPOAE) measurement is needed to deter-\nmine whether groups of OHCs are damaged. A studyof a sudden hearing loss case supports the proposedmechanisms: while there was no clear relation of dipla-cousis with hearing threshold and transient otoacousticemissions, the observed frequency shifts in the DPAOEfine structure were in close agreement with the changesin diplacousis ( Knight, 2004 ).\nAnother mechanism may be involved in subjects with\ndiplacousis who have normal hearing. This mechanismmay also explain the presence of monaural diplacousis.\nAn indication for this mechanism arises from two obser-\nvations: (1) in diplacousis related to hearing loss, thepitch shift is pronounced and exists in a broad frequencyrange, while in subjects with normal hearing the shift istypically only /C62% and is distributed in a random man-\nner with a mean shift close to zero; (2) spontaneous otoa-coustic emissions (SPOAE) are commonly observed inpeople with normal hearing; these emissions consist of\na number of pure-tone/very narrow noise bands and\nmay have relatively high intensity.\nIf a person with SPOAE is exposed to a low-level\ntone, then due to the non-linear properties of the cochlea,the tone will interact with SPOAE idiotones and create anumber of distortions with frequencies that follow theequation f\nd¼/C6mfet/C6nfSPi, where fdenotes the fre-\nquency, subscript ddenotes distortion, et refers to an\nFig. 21.1.

As SPOAE may contain\nmany frequencies, the resulting perception of a sound\ncan be complex. Reported properties of diplacousis sup-port this hypothesis, while pointing to the complexnature of the proposed interactions ( Formby and\nGjerdingen, 1981; Long, 1998 ).\nTHE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MODEL OF\nDECREASED SOUND TOLERANCE\nThe neurophysiologic model of tinnitus, decreasedsound tolerance, and the treatment approach based onthe model, known as tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT),were introduced in 1990 ( Jastreboff, 2000, 2007b,\n2010; Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001, 2006 ). An analysis\nof negative reactions experienced by patients led to theproposition that the auditory system plays a secondaryrole in clinically significant decreased sound tolerance,\nand that other systems in the brain are dominant. While\na number of systems in the brain are important (e.g., pre-frontal cortex, attention networks, systems involved inmemory), the limbic and autonomic nervous systemsseem to be crucial. The block diagram of the neurophys-iological model of tinnitus as applied to decreased soundtolerance has been described in detail elsewhere(Jastreboff, 2004; Jastreboff and Hazell, 2004;\nJastreboff and Jastreboff, 2004 ).\nThe model can be used to discuss the potential mech-\nanisms of hyperacusis and misophonia. First, the reac-tions experienced by patients are the same in bothhyperacusis and misophonia. This supports the postulatethat the same systems in the brain are responsible forthese reactions. In turn, the type of negative reactionssupports the notion that the limbic and autonomic ner-\nvous systems are dominant in the emergence of these\nreactions. The activation of these systems in the brainoccurs in a different manner for hyperacusis than it doesfor misophonia. With hyperacusis, the presumed mech-\nanism is an abnormally high amplification occurring\nwithin the auditory pathways (predominantly at the sub-conscious level) that yields a strong neuronal activationevoked by moderate or weak sound. Similar activation isevoked in a normal subject following exposure to a highlevel of sound. The limbic and autonomic nervous sys-tems are activated as a consequence of the high levelof auditory system activation. Thus, patients with hyper-\nacusis experience the same problems while exposed to\nmoderate or weak sound that a person without hypera-cusis does when subjected to a very high level of sound(Fig. 21.2 A) (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2004 ).\nProposed mechanisms of misophonia involve a high\nlevel of activation of the limbic and autonomic nervous\nsystems due to enhanced functional connections\nbetween the auditory system and other systems in the\nbrain (mainly the limbic and autonomic nervous systems\nfor specific patterns of a sound only) ( Jastreboff and\nJastreboff, 2009, 2013 ). At the same time, the auditory\nsystem functions normally ( Fig. 21.2 B). Note that the pre-\nsumed neurophysiological mechanisms are distinctively\ndissimilar for hyperacusis and misophonia, and conse-quently the treatments are different as well. Therefore,it is important to assess the presence and extent of both\nphenomena in a patient as each condition needs to be\ntreated using different approaches. Audiologic evalua-tion provides only partial help in this regard and there-fore a detailed interview is crucial.\nTREATMENTS\nTreatment for hyperacusis has taken two opposite direc-tions. The most common approach is to advise patients toavoid sounds and use ear protection. This is based on thereasoning that, because patients became sensitive to a\nsound, they are supposedly more susceptible to sound\nexposure and consequently need extra protection.Patients easily embrace this reasoning and begin to\nFig. 21.2.

      "text": "protect their ears, even to the extent of using earplugs in\nquiet environments. Unfortunately, this well-intended\napproach makes the auditory system even more sensitiveto sound and further exacerbates hyperacusis ( Vernon\nand Press, 1998; Formby et al., 2003, 2007, 2013;Hawley et al., 2007 ).\nThe opposite approach to treating hyperacusis\ninvolves desensitization, wherein patients are exposedto a variety of sounds. The desensitization approach\nhas been promoted for some time with a number of pro-\ntocols and types of sounds used. For example, soundswith certain frequencies removed, short exposure tomoderately loud sound, or prolonged exposure to rela-tively low-level sounds have been used ( Vernon and\nPress, 1998; Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2000 ). “Pink\nnoise therapy,” as proposed by Vernon and Press\n(1998) , has gained some recognition. In this approach,\npatients were advised to stop ear overprotection and tolisten to pink noise through headphones set to the highestcomfortable level for 2 hours a day. A group of patientswere provided with pink-noise cassette tapes and ques-tionnaires were mailed to 30 participants. Out of20 patients who responded, 13 reported using these tapesin a systematic manner and 7 (54%) reported improve-ment in their hyperacusis ( Vernon and Press, 1998 ).\nA version of pink-noise therapy has also recently beenproposed for tinnitus and hyperacusis by Johnson\n(2014) . The protocol combines the use of pink noise with\na 16-week cognitive exercise program divided into sec-tions devoted to different topics, such as recognitionand relief. To date, no results have been published inthe peer-reviewed literature regarding the effectivenessof this approach.\nThere are no published treatments for diplacousis and\npolyacousis. In one patient’s case, the use of aspirinresulted in a reduction of SPOAE into the noise floorand eliminated monaural diplacousis ( Long, 1998 ).\nTinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) for\ndecreased sound tolerance\nTRT can help patients with tinnitus and hyperacusis. Thepresence of hyperacusis is one of the key factors in thecategorization of TRT patients and in determining theprotocol for treatment ( Jastreboff, 1999, 2010;\nJastreboff and Hazell, 2004 ). It is recommended that\nif hyperacusis is present it must be treated first. For some\npatients with decreased sound tolerance, it is possible to\ncompletely remove hyperacusis and misophonia and toeffectively provide a cure for these conditions(Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001, 2013 ).\nAccording to the principles of the neurophysiological\nmodel of tinnitus, prolonged exposure to relativelylow-level sound is recommended and is used as a part\nof TRT. Independent results support the use of TRTfor the treatment of hyperacusis and have shown that\nthe desensitization approach used in TRT has a statisti-\ncally and clinically significant impact on hyperacusis\n(Formby, 2007; Formby et al., 2007, 2013 ). Therefore,\nfor hyperacusis patients, avoiding silence and being con-\ntinually exposed to sound are crucially important. Thesound level should be well controlled during treatmentand should never induce discomfort or annoyance.Ear-level, wearable sound generators, which facilitate\nkeeping the sound at a constant, well-controlled level,\nare often employed.\nUnfortunately, patients with decreased sound toler-\nance (particularly misophonia) tend to set the sound levelof their devices close to or at the threshold of hearing,and this is considerably less efficient for tinnitus andhyperacusis treatment. The use of real-ear measure-ments as a guide in setting and checking the sound level\nfor all patients who use instrumentation to treat\ndecreased sound tolerance is very helpful to patientsand should be performed during their initial andfollow-up visits with the TRT clinician. The recom-mended range of sound is from 6 to 16 dB sensationlevel (SL).\nDesensitization works on the auditory system. There-\nfore, this approach will not affect misophonia, which\nneeds to be addressed via the active extinction of condi-\ntioned reflexes between the auditory system and the lim-bic and autonomic nervous systems. This can beachieved by specific counseling and protocols for work-ing with sound ( Jastreboff, 2007a; Jastreboff and\nJastreboff, 2002, 2004, 2013 ). In particular, patients\nare advised to systematically engage in pleasant activi-ties they enjoy where sounds play an indispensable role,\nsuch as listening actively to one’s favorite music or to\naudiobooks following a specific protocol ( Jastreboff\nand Jastreboff, 2002 ). Other activities include shopping\nin a mall, going to parties, dining in restaurants, andattending movies. The main idea is to create an associa-tion of a given sound with a pleasant situation (imple-menting the active extinction of conditioned reflexes).\nThere are four classes of protocols for misophonia.\nThe specific protocol used is tailored to the individualpatient. Frequently, more than one protocol is used totreat misophonia. Each protocol is geared to create a pos-itive association with a sound, but the protocols differwith respect to the extent of control the patient has overthe sound environment and, in the case of protocol cat-egory 4, employ the use of sounds with a positive asso-ciation together with bothersome sounds which evoke\nnegative reactions ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2013 ).\nProtocol category 1 provides the patient with full con-\ntrol over the selection of sound, its level, and duration.\nAs such, it can be used even in cases of coexisting signif-icant hyperacusis and can be implemented from the startof treatment.384 P.J.

This protocol can be used only whensignificant hyperacusis is absent or has been eliminatedby treatment. Therefore, the introduction of this proto-col is frequently delayed.\nProtocol category 4 uses the concept of complex con-\nditioned stimuli and combines the exposure to soundswhich evoke negative reactions with the simultaneous\nexposure to sound the patient regards as highly positive\nand enjoyable. The ratio of sound levels of positive-to-negative sound is gradually decreased. The environmentwhere this protocol is used is taken into account, as manypatients react differently depending on where they areexposed to a bothersome sound (i.e., home, school, apublic place, a restaurant, a friend’s home). The multi-sensory aspect of stimuli is also taken into account, as\nsome patients react even to seeing someone produce\noffensive sounds (e.g., eating).\nAn analysis was made of 201 consecutive patients\ndiagnosed with decreased sound tolerance and treatedwith TRT at Emory Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Center.A total of 184 patients (92%) had misophonia; 17 patients(8%) had hyperacusis alone, and 56 patients (28%) hadhyperacusis and misophonia concurrently. The propor-\ntion of patients with significant hyperacusis (with or\nwithout misophonia) who required specific treatmentis similar to the 25–30% reported in the literature(Jastreboff et al., 1999; Hazell et al., 2002; Herraiz\net al., 2003, 2006; Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2004 )\nand to the 26% we have reported previously(Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2002 ).\nImprovement in hyperacusis was judged on the basis\nof changes in LDLs combined with responses obtainedduring the structured interviews, while improvement inmisophonia was solely based on the interviews. This deci-sion was based on the observation that, in cases of mis-ophonia, any LDL values could be seen and the valueswere not correlated with patients’ judgment of the prob-lems due to decreased sound tolerance.\nOf 201 patients with decreased sound tolerance, 165\npatients (82%) showed significant improvement. For56 patients with hyperacusis (with or without misopho-nia), 45 patients (80%) showed significant improvement.The effectiveness of treatment for misophonia with orwithout hyperacusis was identical (152 of 184 patientswith misophonia accompanied by hyperacusis, or 83%,and 139 of 167 patients with misophonia alone, or\n83%). As noted earlier, in some cases it is possible\nto achieve a cure for misophonia as well as for hypera-cusis ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001, 2013 ). Further-\nmore, our clinical observations demonstrated thattreatment of misophonia is crucial to achieving a suc-cessful outcome for tinnitus treatment ( Jastreboff and\nJastreboff, 2012 ).\nCONCLUSIONS\nDecreased sound tolerance (hyperacusis and misopho-nia) remains a challenging topic to study and to treat.Many questions are unanswered. The mechanisms arespeculative and unproven. Even less is known aboutdiplacousis and polyacousis.\nThe neurophysiological model oftinnitus and TRT pro-\nvide an approach that helps patients and may ultimatelyresult in a better understanding of decreased sound toler-\nance. There is a need to investigate the potential mecha-\nnisms of diplacousis and polyacousis as our knowledgeof these phenomena is severely limited and effective treat-ments for these problems have not been established.\nREFERENCES\nAdour KK, Wingerd J (1974).
