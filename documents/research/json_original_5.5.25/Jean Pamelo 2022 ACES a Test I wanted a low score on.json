These \nhealth factors were within the leading causes \nof illness, disability, and death as well as poor \nquality of life overall. In their research, Felitti et \nal (1998) found that adults who had experienced four or more ACEs showed a 12-times-higher \nprevalence to health risks such as alcoholism, drug use, depression, and suicide attempts. Additionally, children and youth of different races \nand ethnicities do not experience ACEs equally. \nA 2018 national US study found that 61 per cent of black non-Hispanic children and 51 per cent of \nHispanic children had experienced at least one \nACE, compared with 40 per cent of white non-Hispanic children (Sacks and Murphy, 2018).\nThere were 10 types of \nchildhood trauma measured in the ACEs study. Five were related to abuse and neglect, \nwhile others were related to \nparental social problems such as addiction, domestic violence, \nincarceration, and separation. \nThe number of these types of traumas a child experienced \ndetermined their ACEs score. \nFor example, a child who was physically neglected and had one alcoholic parent and \nanother who was incarcerated \nwould have an ACEs score of three. It is important to acknowledge that the ACEs \nscore is meant as a guideline; if a child experienced \nother types of toxic stress over months or years, then those would likely increase the risk of health \nconsequences. \nThe graphic on page 3 captures the original \ntypes of ACEs (e.g., childhood abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction) as well as expanded ACEs \nthat consist of additional experiences that impact childhood trauma (bullying, community violence, \nlack of neighbourhood safety, racism, and living in foster care).ACEs are not unusual in our society and can affect \nanyone regardless of their gender identity, sexual \norientation, education, race, income, heritage, culture, etc. Canadian statistics have estimated \nthe prevalence of exposure to physical abuse to \nbe 26 per cent; sexual abuse, between seven and \n15 per cent; emotional abuse, between 14 and 17 \nper cent;  intimate partner violence, between six \nand 26 per cent; parental divorce or separation, \nbetween 11 and 17.6 per cent; and poor parental \nmental health, 20.6 per cent (England-Mason G et. \nal, 2018). The CDC (1998) noted that 61 per cent of adults had at least one ACE and 16 per cent had \nfour or more types of ACEs, which amounts to one \nin six adults experiencing four or more types of \nACEs. \nWithin Ontario, the Community \nResilience Coalition of Guelph \nand Wellington reports that 81 \nper cent of adults had at least one ACE, while 31 per cent had four or more (Wellington-\nDufferin-Guelph Public Health, \n2019). They also advise that ACEs occur together, and within \ntheir research, people with \none ACE were two to 18 times \nmore likely to report other \nACEs. When “racism” and “living in foster care” were added as adverse childhood experiences, \nit stands to reason that again \ndifferent inequity would be noted within different \nraces and ethnicities. Racial disproportionality \nhas received much attention in the child welfare \nsystem where African Canadians are significantly overrepresented in foster care, particularly \nin Ontario and Quebec (One Vision One Voice \nSteering Committee, 2016).\nAwareness of ACEs is the first step to changing \noutcomes, as learning about ACEs can be part of \nbreaking the cycle. There is an exciting and positive future filled with hope that can be achieved. Aside There are significant \nactions parents and \nother adults can take \nfor the next generation \nof children and young \npeople to either disrupt \nthe impact of ACEs or to \nprevent the experiences \naltogether."

Involvement in school activities; cultural customs and traditions; peer mentoring; community service through school or a religious organization; family cultural traditions; or music, arts, or sports groups allows them to develop a sense of belonging and have a sense that they matter. This sense of belonging helps children develop into secure and resilient adults. \n4) Children need to have a lot of opportunities for \nsocial and emotional growth to learn how to self-regulate emotions and behaviour, and to acquire skills needed to respond to challenges.

Together, we have a responsibility, \nand opportunity, to promote positive childhood experiences that support healthy development, \npositive mental health, and resilience. \nMultiple strategies are needed to address the \ncauses of ACEs and their developmental, health, \nand social consequences, and to foster resilience. \nThese span many fields of interest, including health and social services, education and literacy, children’s mental health, parenting, recreation, and \ncommunity development, among others. Thus, an \neffective response requires the collaboration of many community players, including individuals with lived \nexperience of adversity.\nSince 2019, the Community Foundation for Kingston \nand Area (CFKA) has led conversations about the \nimpact of early adversity on lifelong health and the importance of community resilience to prevent and \nmitigate the effects of ACEs. Early conversations about \nhow to address ACEs and build community resilience led to the formation of the Kingston, Frontenac, and \nLennox & Addington ACEs & Resilience Coalition \n(KFL&A ARC) in 2020. Currently, the KFL&A ARC \ncomprises representatives from the following local agencies:\n1. Addiction and Mental Health Services-KFL&A\n2. Algonquin & Lakeshore Catholic District School Board\n3.

Toward Common Ground, which also supports the Community Resilience Coalition of Guelph & Wellington, has facilitated these meetings and the development of the coalition’s strategic plan. Moving forward, we aim to improve access to trauma-informed programs, services, and systems for children and families; measure the impact of our work; and pursue opportunities for collaboration within and beyond the KFL&A area to promote resilience in children, families, and their communities. \nKris Millan is retired after a 30-year career at KFL&A \nPublic Health.

A newborn child enters the world already \nwith the experience of hearing their mother’s heart -\nbeat and voice, and also potentially carrying with them the effects of toxic stress and adversity their mother \nexperienced during pregnancy.\n1\nWhen a child enters an early learning program, such as a licensed childcare setting or EarlyON Child and \nFamily Centre, they carry with them the sum total of \ntheir life experiences, or in the words of educator Loris Malaguzzi, “You never come in an isolated way; you al -\nways come with pieces of the world attached to you.”\n2 \nParents, too, arrive at early learning programs with \n“pieces of the world” attached. These pieces include \nvalues and beliefs, rich cultural heritage, and hopes and dreams for their children. Unfortunately, all too often these pieces also include parents’ own history of \nadversity.\nWe know that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) \nare incredibly common, and that the prevalence of \nACEs spans across sociodemographic groups.\n3  Given \nthe prevalence of ACEs, many parents struggle with \ntheir own histories of trauma.

These programs offer play-based early-learning opportunities for children, and are offered by skilled RECEs who also support parents and caregivers by answering questions, brainstorming through challenges, facilitating introduc -\ntions to and connections with other parents and care -\ngivers, and sharing information about other relevant community services.\nEarlyON Child and Family Centres began in July 2018 \nwith the transition and consolidation of three previous child and family centre programs — Ontario Early Years \nCentre, Better Beginnings Better Futures programs, and Family Literacy Centres. By late 2019, EarlyON programs attracted approximately 7,000 children, parents, and caregivers across Kingston and Frontenac County each month. This dramatically shifted with the onset of COVID restrictions and closure of in-person programs. EarlyON service providers rapidly pivoted, providing virtual pro -\ngramming and continuing to stay connected with partici-pants as much as possible. As COVID restrictions permit -\nted, EarlyON re-opened outdoor programs, and later, indoor programs, once again welcoming participants in person. Currently, program attendance is still signifi -\ncantly below pre-pandemic levels, although numbers are rising. In May 2022 EarlyON programs saw 4,200 visits.\nWhile EarlyON programs welcome children from birth to \nsix years, most children aged five and six attend kin -\ndergarten. Therefore, the majority of children visiting EarlyON range in age from birth to four years.  The 2021 \ncensus reported 6,965 children under the age of four in the Kingston and Frontenac area. Based on the average monthly attendance of 1,200 in 2021 and the beginning of 2022, EarlyON programs are reaching approximately 17 per cent of children in the region under the age of four each month.\nLicensed childcare programs offer full-day care for \nchildren from infancy until the start of kindergarten (3.8 years), as well as before- and after-school programs for kindergarten and school-aged children.

Given the 2021 census reported 6,965 children under the age of \nfour in Kingston and Frontenac, this indicates there \nare spaces for approximately 26 per cent of the local \npopulation of children of pre-kindergarten age. How -\never, it is important to recognize that due to significant province-wide shortages of qualified, registered early \nchildhood educators, some programs are not able to operate at their full licensed capacity.\nIn both licensed childcare programs and EarlyON,  \nRECEs work in partnership with families, recognizing that a child’s family is the first and most important influence in that child’s life. Working from the funda -\nmental belief that families love and want the best for \ntheir children, RECEs recognize that the well-being of a \nchild is inextricably linked with the well-being of their family.\n5\nA child’s well-being, growth, and development are \nrooted in strong, secure, and nurturing relationships.6 \nIn addition to the foundational relationship between \nparent and child, strong supportive community relationships are essential for the well-being of both parent and child.\n7 RECEs recognize how crucial these \ncommunity connections are. How Does Learning \nHappen?, a document at the core of Ontario’s Early \nYears pedagogical framework, states that  “Fostering \ngood relationships with children and their families is the single most important priority for educators in early \nyears programs.”\n8 A strong statement, to say the least. \nMany new parents do not start their parenting journey \nwith support networks in place.

For \nthese parents, who do not have a “built-in” community of family and friends when their child is born, RECEs and early learning programs can be a lifeline of support. RECEs work to create community, offer parents a venue to connect with each other, and build their own supportive networks.\nRegistered early childhood educators also work to \nsupport parents individually. When a parent engages in conversation with an RECE about their child, the RECE can invite the parent to actively reflect on the parenting strategies they choose. With this reflection, parents can intentionally choose to carry forward positive approaches from their own childhood, and actively choose to let go of strategies that did not serve them well or were potentially harmful. For parents who carry their own history of ACEs, this creates opportunity for them to learn about and make use of positive strategies that match their values and hopes for their child. Without active reflection and decision-making, parents will often repeat patterns from their own childhood, both positive and negative.\n9  In addition to supporting parents through \nconversation, RECEs offer ongoing encouragement and role modelling of positive attachment and guidance techniques and offer a parent affirmation of their own relational- and attachment-based parenting choices. \nThrough building relationships, supporting parents, \nand nurturing the growth of connected and supportive communities, registered early childhood educators are an integral part of the community effort in preventing and mitigating the effect of ACEs. \nA child is not born knowing all they need to know \nabout navigating the world, and no new parent instantly knows all they need to know about raising their child. RECEs are crucial partners with parents through the early years of their parenting journeys.  \nLaura Gow, BA, RECE, has 20+ years’ experience in the \nearly learning sector.

It was, \nunfortunately, the adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) test, which gauges the amount of trauma a person experienced as a child that could, eventually, \nlead to premature death or various health conditions. \nLike many families, our family had secrets. My father \nwas a Jekyll-Hyde personality: by day a brilliant \naccountant and by night, a violent, alcoholic lunatic \nwho used his children, wife, and pets as punching bags. He ran his house like his own military operation. \nIf he allowed it, you could talk. Otherwise, you sat as \nsilent as a stone. If you saw him coming down the hall, you jumped into a doorway to let him pass — or else. \nMy mother was not a better person than my father was, and, arguably, she was even worse. She incited my father to beat her six children, allowed her friends \nto beat us, and was complicit in kicking her 15-year-old daughter onto the city streets to find her own way \nin life. (It didn’t end well.) My mother refused to get a \njob even when we were homeless, living in a friend’s \ngarage, and not having enough food. Instead of getting \na job, she openly hoped my father would somehow die so she could get the insurance money. (“God” told her it would happen.) And then there was the sexual abuse \nand the pedophilic grandfather.     \nMy mother, not wanting to deal with the demands \nof young children, locked me in the basement as a \npreschooler. Day after day, month after month, I can’t describe, even now, how lonely it was.

I still have the scar on my toe, but the \nemotional scar of not being wanted was far worse. \nYet, to the outside, we were a “normal” family with the \noccasional upset and family drama, for we dared not say a word to “outsiders” about our family life or there would be hell to pay for how we were staining our parents’ reputation.\nOne of the most challenging parts of poverty is being \nunable to hide it. I wore a yellow T-shirt to school nearly every single day one year. Ten years later, a fellow student still laughed about how “obsessed” I was with the colour yellow, not knowing that was all I had. I had no money to buy basic necessities and my mother delighted in my humiliation, always looking for an opportunity to douse me in shame and elevate herself, proudly displaying her basic hygiene items in front of me that I couldn’t afford as a teen. I was still so poor in early adulthood that my bones stuck out of my pants. The bullying I experienced for years drove me into deep depression, cutting, and suicide attempts. \nI left home as a teen and while I didn’t have a blueprint \nfor how to live, it was the best decision I ever made. Predictably, I continued unhealthy patterns as an adult and suffered partner abuse all throughout university, as a college instructor, and as a consultant who wrote an international best-seller (I later wrote another one). Even though I rose to the top of my field and became an international speaker, I had this secret life that followed me wherever I went. I was good at hiding. At my core, I didn’t believe I was worthy of anything — a \ngood life, respect, or dignity. \nAt several points, my body showed me that I had \nhealing to do. Unknown ailments would appear. I was diagnosed with several different mental health issues and, at the root of them all, I believe, was complex PTSD and misophonia (extreme sound sensitivity). At one point, while driving on the highway, my airways suddenly spasmed uncontrollably and I couldn’t breathe. Gasping for breath terrified me so much that I went to emergency, where it was later confirmed I had laryngospasms. Luckily for me, my family doctor was very experienced in trauma-informed care. We worked through it together, tracing it back to my traumatic past and learning how to deploy mindfulness and self-soothing techniques that eventually quieted down the laryngospasms. I will forever be grateful to my family doctor for being dedicated to embracing ACEs and understanding the importance of going to the roots of decades-old trauma to deal with current health issues.\nI’m continuing my journey of healing. I employ a multi-\nmodal approach that chips away at my symptoms. I do yoga, reiki, meditation, acupuncture, EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy, brain spotting, and an assortment of other health-oriented practices. It’s my part-time job. Once difficult and painful, it’s now a job I look forward to doing because it increases my capacity to create my own blueprint for life … lean into life.

Nurses work with clients to identify early \nadversities and offer appropriate interventions; \nsupport parents through capacity-building; and help to build strong, positive relationships with various forms of supportive networks.\nHealthy Babies Healthy Children (HBHC) is a \nprovincially funded home-visiting program that uses \nboth registered nurses and family home visitors to support families in building resilience and reducing the burden of adversities. This free service is available to Ontario families from the prenatal \nstage until a child transitions to \nschool. Clients are referred by either an external source, typically a family doctor, hospital, or other care provider, or through a self-referral by contacting the local \npublic health unit. Using a validated \nscreening tool, a public health nurse then screens the clients for early identification of risk. \nThe HBHC home visiting team \nhas connected clients with critical services related to infant growth \nand development and maternal \nhealth, successfully supported breastfeeding, built positive parenting and healthy attachment capacities, supported safe and stable environments, and much more. \nProfessional HBHC staff members are skilled in \nsupporting caregivers with multiple goals. Given the evidence to support early intervention, staff may work on goals with clients during the early childhood, \npostnatal, and even prenatal phases. Registered \nnurses travel to clients’ homes to complete an in-depth assessment targeting ACEs and other potential barriers to healthy growth and development. Together, the nurse and client will develop family-centred goals \nusing a strengths-based approach. Interventions may include skill-building, health-teaching, referrals, \nconsultations, and service co-ordination, among other measures. Intervention goals aim to support \ncaregivers in achieving a strong, healthy connection \nwith their children and to support building stable environments. These types of connections contribute to the prevention of ACEs or mitigate the effects of \nexisting ACEs.\nUsing developmental tools, nurses will assess children \nduring home visits. These assessments are useful for early identification of physical, social/emotional, and \nlanguage/cognitive development concerns. Depending \non the significance of identified deficiencies, the nurse may use \nclinical judgement to monitor, offer interventions, or refer to specialized services. In addition, the \nnurse or home visitor will empower \ncaregivers to recognize age-appropriate milestones and teach them when to intervene, if needed. \nThese types of early identifications \nand interventions offer a stronger start for children. \nThe program’s nurses are also \ncertified in the use of the University \nof Washington’s Parent-Child \nInteraction Scales, valid and reliable assessments for measuring caregiver-child interactions in either \nfeeding or teaching situations. \nInterventions based on data from these scales typically \nfocus on building healthy attachment and enhancing the quality of the caregiver-child relationship. Nurses identify strengths and deficiencies with respect to \nchild cues, caregivers’ responses to child cues, or both. \nTogether with the parents, nurses will use various methods to demonstrate how to effectively identify and positively respond to child cues. Caregivers are \nconcretely guided to help meet the child’s emotional \nand physical needs in an affectionate and comforting manner.

Through building resilience, children can be better-equipped to overcome the \nadversities associated with unstable environments. \nParenting practices vary across cultures and can be \nquite subjective. Positive parenting works to encourage independence and healthy growth and development in children. The HBHC program’s nurses and home visitors work with caregivers so they may become \nmore knowledgeable and skilfull in positive parenting. \nNurses and home visitors, in partnership with families, offer strategies towards agreed-upon goals to increase nurture and protection of children. This capacity-building approach again \nsupports caregivers to model and teach \ndevelopmentally appropriate skills.\nIntervening on ACEs helps to lessen \nimmediate and long-term harms to children. Addressing parental health during the postpartum, early childhood, and prenatal phases can help reduce \nACEs. Healthy Babies Healthy Children \nnurses support parents during the prenatal period to encourage optimal maternal, fetal, and neonatal health by ensuring access to care and healthy nutrition as well as evidenced-informed \nhealth teaching.\nDuring the postpartum and early childhood phases, \nnurses will assess for postpartum depression, addiction/substance use, and unhealthy relationships. Interventions in any or all these areas directly helps mitigate ACEs by early detection and appropriate referrals for mental health supports, management of \ndependencies, and support for positive healthy familial \nrelationships, respectively. By supporting healthy relationships, families are better able to develop strengths in protecting against violence and adversity, \nthereby reducing childhood exposure to intimate partner violence and other forms of abuse. \nAnother strategy in preventing ACEs is strengthening \neconomic supports to families. Assessments regarding food security and safe and stable housing help the nurse determine which early interventions will be most useful for families. In consultation with a registered dietitian and in collaboration with family home visitors, nurses can help family members access safe, nutritious, and affordable foods through skill-building techniques to enhance food literacy (e.g., \nmeal planning, nutritional knowledge, budgeting, food preparation, and food access).\nThe HBHC program also helps \nparents understand how to keep their children safe by managing hazardous conditions in their child’s environment through anticipatory guidance and an understanding of their child’s developmental needs. Staff may work with clients to further assess and determine strategies for strengthening independent life skills such as household financial security, an identified ACEs-prevention strategy. \nIt is unlikely ACEs will ever be \neradicated, in part due to their cyclic generational trauma, but the effects of \ntrauma and toxic stress on child development can be mitigated by offering appropriate evidence-informed interventions, like HBHC, to develop resiliency in families. \nSusan Potvin, RN, is program manager for Healthy \nBabies Healthy Children and Early Years Programs.

This could be reaching out to family, friends, \ncommunity agencies, or  medical professionals. These competencies can help individuals, families, and communities resist the effects of ACEs in their lives.\nIn my communication with those I have worked \nwith, the most important factor that has come up as the biggest difference-maker in thriving — not just \nsurviving — despite growing up with ACEs is having \none supportive person in their corner they could depend on, who believed in them and their ability to be the best version of themself. \nThis was certainly the case for me. \nWhen  I connected with this person in my early 20s,  I started to realize my childhood and the childhood of \ngenerations of my family had been \nstraddled with ACEs. I became aware of what that could mean for future generations if I and other branches of my family didn’t stop the cycle. Their support and belief in me was something I had never experienced before and changed me and my \nfamily’s life, and I believe those of \nfuture generations to come. This is \nthe most common thing I hear from others who have made the choice to learn new skills and not repeat the things they have lived.\nIf you get the chance, be that person for someone who \ncould use a person in their corner. You just might save and change a life for the better.\nMichele Cole is a strong community advocate who is \npassionate about eliminating stigma for vulnerable \npopulations and having accessible programs available for \nthem. She is a resiliency and compassion fatigue train-the-trainer and educator and a life-long learner. In my work with families over the past 30 years I have \nseen this to be the case in most communities dealing with generational trauma, addictions, adverse mental health, and poverty. Families are trying to do the best \nthey can with what they have and know.\nI believe my parents, like most whose homes and \ncommunities unwittingly create ACEs during their \nchildren’s upbringing, are unaware of it and want to \nbe and offer what all parents want when they have their first child: love, security, and happiness. I bet if the majority of parents were asked what they want for \ntheir child in five, 10, or 20 years when \nthey are first born, the answers would be universal: they would want their \nchildren to be healthy and happy, and \nto feel loved. \nACEs are not planned or purposeful. \nThey are often due to a lack of life \nand parenting skills the adults in the \nhousehold learned or modelled and a lack of access to services that support \nlearning these skills. When there are \nprograms available to support gaining this knowledge and these skills, they often cost money that families can’t \nspare or don’t provide things like \ntransportation and childcare so they can attend. Eliminating these barriers can make all the difference in parents \nattending and learning new skills that can change the \nfuture for their children and generations to come.\nIn my training as a resiliency program facilitator \nand my research on the subject of ACEs, protective \nfactors, and resiliency I have discovered that some of the most important skills that can be mastered to \novercome ACEs are emotional regulation — gaining \nthe skills needed to learn to respond rather than \nreact to challenges in life, being in charge of our emotions and not letting them control us; calming and focusing activities such as breathing exercises, \nmeditation, and becoming aware of our thinking and \nhow it affects our emotions and in-turn our reactions/\nThe most important \nfactor is having one \nsupportive person \nin their corner \nthey could depend \non, who believed \nin them and their \nability to be the best \nversion of themself."

Trauma and adversity change people; resilience makes it possible to successfully adapt and maintain our well-being.\n2 Resilience is not \nan individual trait that someone has or doesn’t have, and there are many ways to show resilience. Our capacity to be resilient in challenging times relies on our interactions with the people, resources, and environments that surround us.  Resilience may look different within individuals, and in different situations, contexts, and communities.\n3,4\nResilience is influenced by the accumulation of negative experiences (or risk factors) and positive experiences (or protective factors) over time. Communities and families contribute to the risk factors and protective factors that individuals experience. Often, these risk and protective factors are out of an individual’s control. Risk factors such as adverse childhood experiences, chronic poverty, racism, and discrimination can contribute to a toxic stress response and may have a profound effect on children and their long-term health and well-being."

The Community Resilience Initiative describes NEAR as a group of emerging sciences that can give caregivers practical insights into connecting and coaching youth. This cluster of information can help us connect to and better understand adolescent brain development. \nNeuroscience  — Adolescent brains are incredibly \nmalleable and adaptable. This is a superpower \nfor young people because it allows them to learn quickly, adapt, and thrive in many situations. The one drawback that adults often forget is that adolescent brains are not fully formed until about the age of 25. (This is assuming that the youth had a strong connection to loving caregivers as a child.) We ask youth to take on “adult” decision-making during adolescence. Young people begin driving, voting, and career-planning at an age when their brains are not fully formed. A key area of the brain is the prefrontal cortex. As the executive functioning part of the brain, it allows humans to acquire language and the ability to reason, make inferences, and plan for the future. During adolescence, this area is still underdeveloped and is often competing with impulses and basic needs. It’s not that young people aren’t thinking; their brains are simply learning how to process key information in an efficient way. \nHow can we help youth be less impulsive? It all starts \nwith understanding self-regulation. The ability to regulate or turn off our body’s stress system and activate our prefrontal cortex is a skill that must be taught. Adults need to teach this skill and, more importantly, model it. “Kids are always watching” couldn’t be truer!\nEpigenetics — Epigenetics is the study of how your \nbehaviours and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. This field is in its infancy and is difficult to research because humans do not live in controlled environments like those in lab studies. What we do know is that the impact of traumatic experiences can be passed on from generation to generation. These experiences A small group of Pathways staff members were inspired to bring this science to Kingston in order to share practical training with community members. The group formed “Trauma Responsive Team Leads” or T.R.T.L.s (pronounced “Turtles”) and worked with the Community Resilience Initiative (CRI) to become certified trauma-responsive trainers. The group comprises four multidisciplinary professionals with unique lived and educational backgrounds. Through the website teachresilience.ca, the T.R.T.L.s are sharing the neuroscience and emerging practices related to how adults can learn and embed this science with young people in their own lives. \nSo what does it take to build resilient youth?

Adverse catastrophic events include the \nbody of research that describes the negative effects \nof traumatic events on an individual (e.g., global \npandemics, war, and climate disasters).\nResilience — Resilience is a skill and is not innate. \nYoung people are not born resilient. It is a skill that must be modelled and learned. Resilience is more \nthan just the ability for a young person to bounce \nback from challenges. The challenge with individual \nresilience is that adolescents do not live in isolation. \nIn order to thrive, adolescents need to build individual resilience, but it needs to be matched by a community that is willing and structurally able to provide what that young person needs. Can young Indigenous youth be completely resilient when their drinking water is poisoned? It is understood that community resilience is the defining metric to ensure that youth have what \nthey need to successfully transition to adulthood.\nThe answer to “How do we build resilient youth?” \ncan be found in the community.
