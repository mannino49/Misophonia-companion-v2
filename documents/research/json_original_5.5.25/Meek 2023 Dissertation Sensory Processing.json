Previous research has focused on characteristics of the trait and mental health \noutcomes. This study investigate d whether mental health graduate students and mental health \nprofessionals had higher SPS than students and professionals in other fields. It also  explore d \nwhat variables might moderate the relationship  between SPS and general wellbeing, career \nwellbeing, and mental health wellbeing for this population.  Two hundred and sixty participants \ncompleted an online survey to measure SPS and wellbeing . In addition to descriptive statistics, a \nfrequency distributi on was conducted to measure the prevalence of low, medium, and high \nsensitivity individuals among the sample. SPS was compared to trait negative emotionality to \nexplore differentiating the two trai ts. SPS scores for participants who identified as graduate \nstudents or professionals in a mental health field were compared to those who were not. Gender \nwas tested as a moderator of the relationship between SPS and the three domains of wellbeing, \nand additional analyses were conducted exploring demographics varia bles as moderators of the \nrelationship between SPS and the three domains of wellbeing.

      "text": "1 CHAPTER I  \nINTRODUCTION  \nSensory processing sensitivity  (SPS) is a biological trait that exists on a spectrum and that \napproximately 20% of individuals in the general population experience (Acevedo, 2020; Aron, \n2010 ). The most notable researcher of SPS, Elaine Aron, created an acronym to describe \nindividuals  with SPS also known as highly sensitive people or person (HSPs ; Aron, 2016). Th e \nacronym DOES  stands for Depth of Processing, Overstimulation, Emotional Reactivi ty, and \nSensing the Subtle, and it outlines the overall core traits of being highly sensitive. Depth of \nprocessing includes cognitively processing information and stimuli more deeply both \nconsciously and unconsciously compared to individuals without the tr ait (Aron, 2016). Often \nbecause of their depth of processing, HSPs can feel more easily fatigued by stimuli; this is \nfrequently  the characteristic with which HSPs notice and struggle most (Aron, 2016). HSPs have \nbeen shown to have more mirror neuron brain activity indicating a stronger ability to understand \nand empathize with others (Aron, 2016). HSPs also show higher activity in the areas of the brain \nresponsible for deciding to act, indicating their increased emotional reactivity (Acevedo et al., \n2014).  \nSPS was formally identified in 1997 and some research already exists exploring th e trait \n(Aron & Aron, 1997). Women often score higher on SPS than men (Aron, 2010 ), though debate \nexists about the underlying nature of this difference. It is known that indivi duals with SPS are \nlower in general wellbeing, career wellbeing, and mental health wellbeing than those without \nSPS (Acevedo, 2020). There are also many positive outcomes reported for individuals with SPS \n(Acevedo, 2020; Jagiellowicz et al., 2016 ). HSPs ha ve been shown to benefit more from positive \nexperiences, especially if they have had mostly positive childhood experiences, than those"

HSPs are also more able to benefit from positive \ninterpersonal environment s giving them higher levels of empathy, creativity, positive emotions, \nand improved communication (Acevedo, 2020). Some research has focused on differentiating \nSPS from other similar characteristics like negative emotionality (formerly neuroticism on the \nBig Five Inventory) and other sensory processing and related psychological diagnoses ( Acevedo \net al., 2017 ; Acevedo, 2020; Costa & McCrae, 1992; Smolewska et al., 2006 ).  \nTo date, SPS has not been explored in a population of graduate students and profession als \nspecifically in mental health fields. Therefore, I have  explor ed the prevalence of SPS among this \npopulation, and their report of  the impact of SPS on their general, career, and mental health \nwellbeing.  \nMental health graduate students and mental healt h professionals are known to experience \nsignificant mental health concerns ( Boyd et al., 2016 ; Butler et al., 2017 ; Rummell, 2015). This \npsychological distress is often due to the nature of their work and studies (Boyd et al., 2016; \nButler et al., 2017). T hese mental health concerns have a serious impact on this population and in \nsome cases have  led to suicide (Gerada, 2018). It is not known how SPS may interact with \ndomains of wellbeing for this population. Understanding the potential relationships between  SPS \nand various forms of wellbeing may have implications for improving mental health outcomes for \nthose who are training for and working in these stressful occupations. The research is a step in \nthat direction.  \nTherefore, I have  investigate d whether SPS is both more frequent in  mental health \ngraduate students and mental health professionals compared to students and professionals from \nother fields , as well as if SPS scores are higher among mental health graduate students and \nprofessionals .

SPS, biological \nsensitivity to context, vantage sensitivity, differential susceptibility, and high environmental \nsensitivity  are all terms that describe the experience of HSP (Acevedo, 2020). SPS also includes \nthe experience of deeper processing of information and stimuli, greater awareness of subtleties, \nincreased empathy, creativity, conscientiousness, self -reflection, intuit ion, an attraction to \naesthetics, and higher sensitivity to overstimulation. High sensitivity is not categorized as a \ndisorder or illness ; rather, it is a biological baseline trait, which exists on a spectrum that some, \nbut not all, individuals’ experience  (Acevedo, 2020; Aron, 2010 ). In addition to being a human \ntrait, SPS has been identified in over 100 animal species. (Acevedo, 2020)."

This acronym stan ds for Depth of Processing, Overstimulation, Emotional \nReactivity, and Sensing the Subtle, and it outlines the overall core traits of being highly sensitive.  \nDepth of Processing and Sensing the Subtle  \nProcessing information and stimuli more deeply both co nsciously and unconsciously is at \nthe core of identifying traits of HSPs (Aron, 2016).  Individuals with SPS also perform better at \nvisual search tasks, are quicker at these tasks, and have fewer errors (Gerstenberg, 2012; \nJagiellowicz et al., 2011). HSPs do more with the information they take in from their \nenvironment, considering it in multiple ways including noticing subtle details, relating, \ncomparing, noticing similarities, and assessing meaning (Aron, 2016). Many individuals do this \nbut HSPs do it mor e quickly and with less effort compared to others (Aron, 2016; Aron et al., \n2010 ). Research supports these differences in highlighting that HSPs use more of the processing \ncenters of the brain when considering stimuli compared to those without the trait (J agiellowicz et \nal., 2011). HSPs also demonstrate more activation in parts of the brain that processes “moment -\nto-moment knowledge of inner states and emotions, bodily position, and outer events ” (Aron, \n2016, p. 19).  \nOverstimulation  \nOften because of their depth of processing trait, HSPs can feel fatigued by stimuli much \nmore easily than non -sensitive individuals (Aron, 2016). This is often the characteristic with \nwhich HSPs notice and struggle most (Aron, 2016). Overstimulation can be  a result of sensitivity \nto light, sound, social interaction, clutter, and the length, intensity, or complexity of the stimuli \nor information they consume, both internal (e.g., emotions) and external (Aron, 2016).

In addition to this neural activation, HSPs also showed higher activity in the \nareas of the brain responsible for deciding to act, specifically when viewing loved ones’ unhappy  \nfacial expressions (Acevedo et al., 2014). HSPs compared to non -sensitive individuals have also \nbeen shown to benefit more from positive experiences, especially if they have had mostly \npositive childhood experiences ( Jagiellowicz et al., 2016 ). \nBackground  \nIn 1997, Aron and Aron identified, based on previous research on childhood \ntemperament, introversion, inhibition, and shyness, that there was evidence to suggest that \nhumans respond to stimuli in one of two manners: action or process. Many individuals thi nk and \nprocess first before acting while others take quick action and process their thoughts afterward. \nThis differential response occurs during the transmission or processing of sensory stimulation. \nHSP tend to spend more time processing than those withou t SPS (Aron  & Aron,  1997). The \nauthors discussed whether SPS was continuous and attempted to define its core characteristics, \nconstructs, and possible subgroups.

Wolf et al. (2008) \ntheorized about the possibility of differential responses to stimuli and discussed the possible \nadvantages and disadvantages of environmental sensitivity. They concluded that the b enefits of a \nhigher sensitivity to stimuli is dependent on the frequency of the stimuli, meaning that if the \nstimuli is rare, additional processing before action could be helpful, but if common, it could be \noverwhelming (Wolf et al., 2008). This argument s upported the likelihood that environmental \nsensitivity and thus SPS as an evolutionary advantage and a form of natural selection we see in \nindividuals today. Research by Belsky et al. (2009) suggested that genetic factors can either help \nor hinder mental h ealth outcomes based on the environment of the individual. This research also \nsuggests that some individuals are more responsive or sensitive to the environment (Belsky et al., \n2009).  Ellis et al. (2011) reviewed the most current research covering differe ntial susceptibility \ntheory (Belsky et al., 2009) and biological sensitivity to context theory (Boyce & Ellis, 2005) , \nwhich are closely related to SPS. They outlined that both theories posit that individuals, like \nthose who experience SPS, are neurobiologi cally sensitive to both positive and negative \nenvironments , which can enhance their ability to developmentally adjust in response, giving \nthem an evolutionary advantage compared to others. Belsky and Pluess (2009) outline d in their \nvantage sensitivity theo ry that sensitivity can be considered an evolutionary advantage, unlike \ndifferential susceptibility theory (Belsky et al., 2009) , which posits that sensitivity may explain \ndisproportionately negative outcomes.  \nThe primary difference between Aron and Aron’ s (1997) original SPS theory and those \noutlined here is that SPS theory was developed from studying individual differences in"

SPS theory is also the first approach to \ncategorize environmental sensitivity as a personality trait. All theories  emphasize differential \nsusceptibility to stimuli including the sensitivity and reactivity to both positive and negative \nenvironments (Acevedo, 2020). Environmental sensitivity theory (Pluess, 2015) was developed \nto integrate many of these theories and encompasses the neurosensitivity hypothesis; this \nhypothesis posits that the central nervous system’s sensitivity spectrum is shaped by a \ncombination of childhood environment, genetics, indexing sensitivity and the interactions \nbetween these, which then is expressed both physiologically and psychologically (Pluess, 2015). \nAdditionally, several sensitivity theories con verge on the position that such an evolutionary \nadvantage would only have to be found in a small subset of the population to remain \nadvantageous (Acevedo, 2020).  \nIn sum, theories involving sensitivity and reactivity to external and internal stimuli have \nbeen conceptualized from several perspectives. Aside from SPS, many other individual \ncharacteristics have been investigated and shown to impact reactivity to the environment and \nhave often been confused with SPS (Acevedo, 2020; Aron & Aron, 1997).

F FM traits are also positively correlated at .41  \nwhen using a multiple correlation of the five variables to predict job satisfaction (Judge  et al. , \n2002).  \nWhile investigating the psychometric properties of the HSP Scale, Smolewska et al.  \n(2006) found that rather than being unidimensional, the scale could also be  described with three \ncomponents. Aesthetic Sensitivity (AES), Ease of Excitation (EOE), and Low Sensory Threshold \n(LST) made up these components and were found to be closely related to facets of the big five \n(Costa & McCrae, 1992) personality tra its. Associations with the big five were strongest between \nAES and Openness to Experience, as well as between LST and EOE and Neuroticism. Despite \nthese associations with neuroticism, factors on the HSP scale were not found to be equal to this \ntrait and co rrelations between AES and neuroticism were small ( Smolewska et al., 2006 ). Bröhl  \net al.  (2020) also found results like Smolewska et al.  (2006) that SPS was closely related to \nseveral facets of the FFM of personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992).

Women in health service psychology graduate programs \nreported significantly higher stress and lower quality of life “compared to other populations” \n(Ayala et al., 2017, p. 18). Psychology graduate students a lso report experiencing vicarious \ntrauma as well as symptoms of PTSD in their work while in school (Ergas, 2012). Many \nparticipants in Ergas’ study reported social withdrawal, isolation, and reduced contact with close \nothers as a result of their training e xperiences (Ergas, 2012). To date, this researcher can find no \nsuch research which assesses the mental health, adjustment, or life satisfaction of graduate \nstudents who are also HSPs.   \nEarly career psychologists also report significant work stress, lack o f resources, and little \ntime for self -care ( Dorociak et al., 2017 ). Research reflects similar outcomes across mental \nhealth professions (Boyd et al., 2016; Butler et al., 2017). Psychologists, social workers, nurses, \nand psychiatrists all face significant prejudice and stigma regarding their own mental health, are \njust as vulnerable to mental illness as their clients, and often do not seek help as a result of this \nstigma ( Banerjee et al., 2020 ; Boyd et al., 2016; Byrne  et al., 2021; Elliott & Ragsdale, 2020 ; \nTurgoose & Maddox, 2017; Ventriglio  et al.,  2020; Vierthaler & Elliott, 2020). Psychiatrists are \namong the list of professions associated with a higher risk for suicide (Gerada, 2018). Due to the \nnature of their work, psychologists and other mental healt h professionals often experience \nvicarious or secondary trauma, complex trauma, compassion fatigue, depression, anxiety, and \nburnout , which can adversely impact their work and life satisfaction (Banerjee et al., 2020; Ivicic \n& Motta, 2017; O’Conner  et al. , 2018; Sciberras & Pilkington, 2018; Turgoose & Maddox, \n2017; Ventriglio  et al. , 2020; Yang & Hayes, 2020).

Professionals working in \ncommunity mental health and in acute inpatient ward settings reported the highest levels of \nemotional exhaustion (O’Conner et al., 2018).

It was predicted \nthat the general distribution of SP S among all participants w ould be approximately 30% low, \n40% medium, and 30% high sensitivity as demonstrated in previous research (Lionetti et al., \n2018).

Therefore, it was believed that \nmental health graduate students and mental health professionals w ould have higher SPS scores in \ncomparison to individuals not in mental health fields. Since previous research has shown that \nmen tend to score lower on SPS compared to women, gender was predicted to be a significant \nmoderator of the relationship  between SPS and WB, CWB,  and MHWB  (Aron, 2010 ). Gender \nsocialization and expression may vary across gender , which could inform an individual’s \nreporting of their sensitivity as well as intersect with their domains of wellbeing (Aron, 2010). \nThis study also explored  what, if any, demographic variables might significantly moderate the \nrelationship  between SPS and WB, CWB, and MHWB . Research has indicat ed that increasing an \nindividual’s understanding of SPS as well as increasing resources to manage symptoms have \nbeen shown to improve outcomes for HPSs (Bakker & Moulding, 2012; Brindle  et al. , 201 5; \nEvers et al., 2008 ; Greven et al., 2019; Yano & Oishi, 2 018; Yano et al., 2018 ). Therefore, this \nstudy also explore d whether an understanding of the SPS trait, resources to manage SPS \nsymptoms, and profession w ould significantly moderate the effects between SPS and the three \ndomains of wellbeing.  \nThis work is i mportant for many reasons. Compared to other topics, SPS is a relatively \nunderstudied topic. This study s ought  to add to the existing research by confirming  some of the \nrecent findings regarding the distribution of  SPS (Lionetti et al., 2018). The study also sought  to \nunderstand if  SPS is higher in individuals working in mental health fields as this is currently a \ngap in the literature though theoretically predicted (Aron, 2010 )."

In general, t his study had fewer low and medium sensitivity individuals and more high \nsensitivity individuals compared to previous research (Lionetti et al., 2018).

In all comparisons , fewer than expected low and medium \nsensitivity individuals and higher  than ex pected numbers of high sensitivity  individuals  were \nidentified  (see Table 5) . This was likely a product of having a sample with more individuals \ninvolved in mental health graduate studies or professions , as these individuals were also found to \nhave signifi cantly higher SPS scores  in the current  study . Though this study contradicts previous \nfindings, having a  sample  that was not representative  or random , these data add valuable \ninformation to what we know about SPS in a population of mental health students a nd \nprofessionals.  \nAron’s ( 2010 ) supposition that, due to their strengths in empathy and sensing the subtle, \nhighly sensitive individuals may find themselves more commonly drawn to mental health related \nfields, is supported by this study.

HSPs tend to need their work to be meaningful in some way and \nmay do best in careers focused on creating, strategizing, supporting, training, consulting, and \nproblem solving, all of which are important parts of mental health vocations (Aron, 2010 ). \nAdditionally, given that graduate students in mental health often struggle with their own mental \nhealth concerns  (Rummell, 2015 ), knowing that SPS may play a role in their mental health \nwellbeing could provide stude nts evidence to advocate for their self -care and should also \nencourage systemic support both in graduate programs and professional environments.   \nThis study found a significant relationship between SPS  and trait negative emotionality . \nThis adds to the gro wing research that SPS is associated with traits like neuroticism but does not \nprovide support for differentiating these two traits from one another. In prior research , \nassociation w as strongest between trait negative emotionality on the Big Five Inventory  and SPS. \nThe findings  in the present study  confirmed th is relationship . The differentiation of SPS from \nother traits is still an area of research that remains underdeveloped  (Acevedo, 2020) ; however, a \nfew studies have  recently  emerged. Bröhl  et al. (2020 ) found that participants in their study who \nwere more sensitive were also more inclined to report anxiety, self -consciousness, and \ndepression. Bröhl  et al. (2022) found similar results in that the highly sensitive participants in \ntheir study also consiste ntly reported higher anxiety and depression, but that none of the SPS \ntraits overlapped completely with any of the F FM traits. Attary and Ghazizadeh (2021) suggested \nthat SPS as a trait may cause a higher predisposition for associated traits like neurotici sm. Higher \nsensitivity seems to lend itself to a higher likelihood of developing mental health concerns so \nthese domains may need to be considered  jointly, especially for individuals who grew up in \nenvironments that were less supportive or negative (Aron, 2010 ; Greven et al., 2019).

SPS was pre sent in two trait clusters  where  \nAES was  associated with  several  positive  traits and  LST and EOE were noted as negative and \nneighbor s to neuroticism (Attary  & Ghazizadeh, 2021). Some of the current literature also \nsuggests that SPS should be perceived as a blending of personality traits across domains of \nneurot icism rather than an equivalent to it ( Smolewska et al., 2006 ). Bas et al. (2021) provided \nadditional support for this conceptualization by recently suggesting SPS as its own distinct \nprofile of personality characteristics rather than a combination of existing characteristics  based \non qualitatively identified themes (e.g., emotional responding, relatedness to others, thinking, \noverstimulation, perceiving details, and global SPS characteristics) that were more complex than \ndescribing SPS a s a combination of negative emotionality and openness . Conversely, Hellwig \nand Roth (2021) suggested that SPS can be fully explained by neuroticism and openness to \nexperiences. Despite conflicting findings in recent research, it is likely that we will cont inue to \nsee SPS and neuroticism present themselves together.  \nWhile a significant relationship between gender and SPS was identified in this study, \ngender was not found to be a significant moderator , despite prior research implying this \nrelationship might exist and commonly reporting gender differences in SPS (Aron, 2010) . Had \nthe sample in the present study had more men, this hypothesis may have been supported. There \nwere also statistically significant gender differences in reports of SPS in this study  that are \nreflective of previous research (Aron, 2010) . In all domains of wellbeing, cisgender men \nconsistently reported lower SPS compared to cisgender women and other gendered individuals \nconsistently reported higher SPS compared to cisgender women.  \nThese g ender differences continue to be identified in current research  as well. More \nrecently, Smith et al. (2022) found that the distribution of sensitivity among men was 11% high"

Rock’s (2022)  \nqualitative  study of highly sensitive gender diverse persons (including transgender, non -binary, \nand gender -fluid individuals) identified gender differences among SPS individuals centered \naround gendered socialization of emotional expression or suppression (e.g., more emoti onal \nexpression if feminine, less if masculine), hormonal cycles, and social expectations for emotional \nexpression in workplaces, romantic relationships, and parenting roles. An additional qualitative \nstudy reported that highly sensitive men often face sti gmatization, marginalization, devaluation, \nand conflation with homosexuality in relation to their identity as HSPs (Miller, 202 1). It would \nmake sense that with so many factors contributing to a negatively skewed perspective of \nsensitivity, men consistentl y under report their SPS.

It is also possible that since our sample had higher than \naverage  resources (e.g., higher education, higher income), that they showed less SPS as adults. \nPrior research implied that raising awareness and understanding of the SPS trait may moderate \nthe relationship between SPS and wellbeing (Bakker & Moulding, 2012; Ever s et al., 2008 ; Yano \n& Oishi, 2018; Yano et al., 2019 ).

It is important to note that t he present \nstudy only evaluated resources with a single measure relating to self -care practices.  \nIn this study, individuals who reported higher income and those who earned higher level \nacademic degrees also tended to have lower SPS scores.

It was \ngenerally representative of the population in the United States regarding ethnicity, age, and \nsexual orientation  (U.S. Cens us Bureau , 2022 ).

The higher -than-average income and \neducation may have biased results in the areas of sensitivity, resources, and wellbeing as income \nand education  often  provide more privilege to an individual and these individuals generally \nexperience less overall stress and greater wellbeing along with th ose privileges. Most \nparticipants had heard of the concept of SPS and had a higher -than-average understanding of the \nconcept , which may have skewed their report of SPS scores.

Specific items assessing knowledge and understanding of SPS were also \ndeveloped solely for this study and not standardized  measures.  \nImplications for Practice and Future Directions  \nDespite these limitations, several important implications can be gleaned f rom this data. \nHSPs have needs that are different from and sometimes in conflict with the needs of the general \npopulation. The present format of our society, with its heavy focus on quantitative productivity \nand timeliness,  is not an environment in which H SPs are easily able to  thrive  (Jaeger, 2004) . \nToday’s mental health workforce may be much more highly sensitive than the general population \nand they are working in an environment not acclimated to their needs.  \nInvestigation of the moderating factors of th e relationship between SPS and domains of \nwellbeing should continue. Increased understanding of these factors will contribute significantly \nto our understanding of what is needed to ensure H SPs are able to fully engage with the strengths \nof their SPS and  reduce negative impact  so that society is able to fully benefit from the \ncontributions of these individuals  (Acevedo, 2020) . Per the present study, w e know that SPS \nscores reduce with age, but other than time, it would be valuable to identify and confirm wh at \nother mitigating factors exist. This will allow for additional evidence to support tailored \nrecommendations for this population to increase  their success . In this study,  HSPs with more \nfinancial and academic privilege had lower scores,  so future research should also investigate \nwhat  aspects of these factors lower SPS.

In addition to these research \nsuggestions, the results of this study have clinical ramifications as well.  \nAcevedo (2020) has articulated several important implications for working with HSPs in \ntherapy. Lack of skills to mitigate overstimulation, diffic ulty setting boundaries, emotion \nregulation, and sensitivity to criticism are primary presenting concerns for HSPs. It is important \nto educate HSPs on how to self -regulate before, during, and after overstimulation experiences. \nOf equal importance is learni ng to say “no” effectively. HSPs have particular difficulty accepting \ntheir emotions, feeling ashamed of negative emotions, believing in their ability to cope, fearing \nnegative emotions will last forever, and fearing nothing can be done to feel better abou t \nregulating emotions, so these are areas that should be targeted. Specific focus on the validity of \ncritical feedback and evaluating their level of trust in the source of feedback are important for \nHSP clients as well. Demonstrating genuine respect for a HSP while providing critical feedback \nis key to reducing the likelihood the feedback will result in lower self -esteem, shame, or \ndefensiveness (Acevedo, 2020).  \nWhile research has found that general vulnerability to anxiety, depression, burnout, and \nreduce d wellbeing is associated with SPS, these findings must be interpreted in the context that"

Focus should be placed on creating \ncomfortable and supportive environments for HSPs academically and vocationally (Acevedo, \n2020).  \nFurthermore, research reporting negative mental health outcomes for HPSs may not have \nfactored in that if participa nts knew of SPS, they may have made appropriate life changes to \naccommodate their trait. Many HSPs report that their life changed with new knowledge of their \ntrait, indicating that raising awareness of the trait in general society and especially with \nindiv iduals who are struggling with the negative impact of SPS is vital (Acevedo, 2020).  \nKindness is the most important orientation to have when relating to an HSP. Generally, \nHSPs tendency toward lower self -esteem will predispose them to process communication  or \nother stimuli as more negative, thus, kindness, compassion, patience, validation, and regular \ncheck ins are warranted. Open discussion about sensitivity and its impact is also essential for \nimproving communication, though HSPs may choose to strategical ly disclose their trait in \nvocational settings as misunderstanding and lack of accommodation of the trait can often lead to \ndevaluation of the HSP within the work environment (Acevedo, 2020).  \nRampelli (2023) argue d that a paradigm shift is needed to make s pace for SPS individuals \nto thrive and to reduce stigma and increase support systems for HSPs.

This data allows HSPs to understand that there is a higher likelihood the intensity of their \nSPS symptoms may reduce over time.
