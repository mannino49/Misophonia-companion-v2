While there is no uniormly accepted treatment to date, dierent intervention approaches are\nbeing investigated. Individual's perceptions odierent misophonia treatment methods may aect compliance\nand satisaction with treatment options. We sought to gather data on patient perceptions ocurrently available\nmisophonia treatments.\nMethods:Using an online survey, we collected data about treatment preerences, treatment usage, and diagnosis\nhistoryrom parents ochildren with misophonia (N=141) and adults with misophonia (N=252).\nResults:Most respondents were not satised with misophonia treatments that they or their children had previ-\nously received. Audiologic interventions including active and passive noise cancelling and liestyle modications\nwere rated as most appropriateor treatment omisophonia by both parent and adult respondents.\nLimitations:Because othe descriptive nature othis study, we chose to use a completer-only approach to ensure\nthe data refect the true responses oparticipants, though this did result in a meaningul proportion omissing\ndata. Participants were selected through convenience sampling and responses were sel-reported. Individuals\nwith more severe misophonia symptoms may be more likely to participate and complete a research survey.\nConclusions:Most interventions are considered inappropriate by parents oyouth with misophonia and by adults\nwith misophonia. This should be interpreted in the light oa general lack omisophonia-specic interventions.\nFindings suggest dissatisaction with currently available treatments and an opportunityor development o\neective treatment strategies corresponding to participants' preerences. Deeper understanding otreatment\npreerences has the potential to guideuture treatment development.\n1. Introduction\nMisophonia is characterized by decreased tolerance to specic\nsounds and associated stimuli, coupled with the presence ovariable\nlevels odistress and impairment ( Lewin et al., 2021 ;Potgieter et al.,\n2019 ;Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). Although understanding omisophonia is\nincreasing, there is a great deal that is unknown about the condition, and\neven less about its treatment. The limited treatment literature has pri-\nmarilyocused on variousormats ocognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT). Case studies/series ( Bernstein et al., 2013 ;Jager et al., 2021 ;\nLewin et al., 2021 ;McGuire et al., 2015 ), an open-label trial ( Schr ¨oder\net al., 2017 ), and one randomized controlled trail ( Jager et al., 2020 )\nhaveound treatment to be modestly eective in reducing misophonia\nsymptoms. Few studies haveocused on pharmacologic or neuro-\nmodulation treatments although a clinical trial is being conducted\n(ClinicalTrials.gov identier: NCT04348591). As theeld advances in\nterms oavailable treatment options, it is currently unknown which\ntherapies are preerred by individuals with misophonia, or which☆Funding: Research reported in this publication was supported by the Ream Foundation/Misophonia Research Fund, and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National\nInstitute oChild Health&Human Development othe National Institutes oHealth [Award Number P50HD103555]or use othe Clinical and Translational Core\nacilities.

Patient preerences contribute to treatment initiation and leads to\nbetter treatment adherence and improved patient outcomes ( Patel et al.,\n2016 ). Numerousactors can aect patient preerencesor a given\ntreatment including belies about treatment and its accessibility ( Proctor\net al., 2011 ). Among youth, understanding both parental and child\ntreatment preerences is particularly important given that treatment\ndecision making is likely to be shared between practitioner, parent, and\nchild ( Lewin et al., 2014a, 2014b ).\nThe present study examines attitudes towards various treatment\noptions among individuals with misophonia or parents ochildren with\nmisophonia. Participants rated the“appropriateness” oa treatment\nstrategyor addressing the symptoms omisophonia on ave-point scale\nrom extremely inappropriate to extremely appropriate. We had two\nspecic aims. First, we aimed to understand which treatments are most\nutilized by adults and children with misophonia as well as which\ntreatments participants view as most appropriateor treating misopho-\nnia. We also evaluated diagnosis historyor each participant, including\nwhether they had been diagnosed with misophonia by a healthcare\nproessional, and iso, that individual's specic proession (e.g., audi-\nologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc.). Second, we evaluated whether\nseverity omisophonia symptoms, age, or gender was associated with\nperceptions odierent treatments. Given the exploratory nature othis\nstudy, no hypotheses were generated.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Participants\nTwo online surveys were distributed and completedrom July 2021\nto September 2021 using the Qualtrics survey platorm. Each contained\nthe same items with language adjusted to be completed by either adults\nwith misophonia or parents oyouth with misophonia. Participants were\nnot compensatedor their study participation. A description othe\nsurveys and survey links were posted in onlineorums and social media\npages as well as emailed to participantsrom a prior misophonia study.\nTo be included in the study, participants had to be adults 18 years or\nolder and either have misophonia or parent a child with misophonia.\nA total o184 parents ochildren with misophonia and 301 adults\nwith misophonia started the survey. A total o141 parents ochildren\nwith misophonia and 252 adults with misophonia completed the survey.\nThe average age oindividuals with misophonia was 14.8 yearsor the\nChild survey (SD=4.3) and 47.4 yearsor the Adult survey (SD=15.9).\nOver halothe sample wasemale (Adult 78 %, Child 72 %) and most\nwere Caucasian (Child=89 %, Adult=91 %). Most responses to the\nchild survey and to the adult survey endorsed that misophonia had\naected the patient's day-to-dayunctioning every dayor the past 7\ndays (59 % and 45 %). Adult survey respondents were more likely to\nhave not sought any treatment than Child survey respondents (25 % and\n11 %). Most respondents to both surveys had a bachelor's degree or a\ngraduate degree (Child=78 % and Adult=64 %). For a complete\nsample description, see Table 1 .\n2.2. Procedure\nThe Institutional Review Board at Baylor College oMedicine\napproved the study protocol and inormed consent procedures beore\nthe survey's distribution. In therst page oeach survey, the study\npurpose was explained, and participants were inormed that their\nparticipation was completely voluntary and that their responses would\nbe kept condential. Ater reviewing therst page, participants con-\nsented by proceeding to the second page to begin the survey.2.3. Measures\n2.3.1. Demographics\nFollowing the cover page, demographic inormation was collected\nrom adults with misophonia and parents ochildren with misophonia\nincluding age, gender, race, ethnicity, and level oeducation. In addi-\ntion, the parent survey included demographic inormation on age,\ngender, race, and ethnicity oparents' children.\n2.3.2. Misophonia\nIn the Misophonia sections, participants were asked ithey (or their\nchild) had been diagnosed with misophonia by a health proessional\nand, iso, by which type ohealth proessional.

This item prompted participants to rate whether\ntheir (or their child's) misophonia aected dailyunctioning (1) never,\n(2) rarely, (3) some days, (4) most days, or (5) every day out othe last\nweek.\n2.3.3. Treatment approaches\nAssessment ovarious treatment options was created using an iter-\native process including review oscientic literature, online misophonia\norums, and online articles discussing misophonia treatments. First, a list\no42 potential treatments and treatment descriptions was created by the\nrst and last two authors, and reviewed by other clinicians with\nexpertise in misophonia. Treatments were then sorted into one onine\ncategories: Medications, Supplements, Liestyle Modications, Relaxa-\ntion Strategies, Psychological Treatment, Audiologic Treatment, and\nNeuromodulation. Within each category, participants rated the appro-\npriateness ospecic misophonia treatment options on ave-point scale\nrom extremely inappropriate to extremely appropriate.“Appropriate-\nness” was not specically dened. Survey items evaluating interventions\nlike liestyle modications or supplements were phrased as“How\nappropriate is [__ strategy]or treating or managing your misophonia?” \nEach othe nine categories also included an item to determine which, i\nany, othe potential treatments in that category participants had pre-\nviously used. Participants were instructed to rate all strategies, regard-\nless owhether they had tried a given intervention.\nModes oDelivery section was included to gauge opinions on the\nappropriateness o amily counseling, group therapy, and teletherapy as\nmodes otreatment delivery. Participants assessed each mode ode-\nlivery on the sameve-point appropriateness scale used in other sections\nothe survey.\n2.3.4. Barriers to treatment\nThe Barriers to Treatment section included an item assessing overall\nsatisaction with the quality omisophonia treatment participants have\npreviously received. Overall satisaction was rated on ave-point scale\nrom very dissatised to very satised.\n2.4. Data analysis\nDescriptive inormation regarding treatment experiences, diagnosis\nhistory, satisaction with treatment, and misophonia impairment were\nanalyzed. Next, treatments in each category were grouped together to\ncreate a mean“appropriateness” rating in order to compare perceptions\noeach treatmentamily. Appropriateness ratings across categories were\nound to have adequate internal consistencyor both parents and adult\nsel-report raters ( α >0.73) exceptor audiology treatment ratings ( α =\n0.65or parent and 0.64or adult sel-report). Their distributions were\nnot signicantly skewed and did not have excessive kurtosis (all less\nthan±2 SD othe mean) ( George and Mallery, 2010 ). Across treatment\ncategories, there were several signicant dierences between parent-\nproxy and adult sel-report mean treatment appropriateness ratings,\nand thus analyses were conducted separatelyor each subsample rather\nthan on data pooled across the two surveys. A repeated-measures\nANOVA was conducted with the average treatment appropriateness\nvariable to compare perceived appropriateness ratings across categories.\nDeviation contrasts were used (i.e., the mean oeach treatment category\nwas compared with the grand mean across treatment categories apart\nrom a reerence category, here being neuromodulation), with p<.01\nbeing considered signicant to accountor multiple comparisons.t-tests\nwere used to compare mean appropriateness ratings among those who\nhad and had not tried a given treatmentamily, interpreting p<.01 as\nsignicant to minimizeamily-wise error with the high number o\ncomparisons conducted.\nCorrelations between treatment appropriateness ratings, misophoniaimpairment, and age were conducted.t-tests were used to compare\ngender dierences in appropriateness ratings.\nAs is typical in online surveys, considerable attrition across the sur-\nvey was noted. Across the two surveys, 83 % (n=393) oparticipants\nwho opened the survey completed demographics andlled out therst\nmisophonia-specic questions (those assessing diagnosis history and\noverall misophonia impairment). Sixty-one percent (n=289) completed\nthe survey to thenal item assessed in this analysis (overall satisaction\nwith treatment). Because othe descriptive nature othis study, we\nchose to use a completer-only approach to ensure the data refect the\ntrue responses oparticipants.\nFor the parent sample, assuming alpha=0.05, power=0.90, and the\nnal completer only sample size o110, this study was powered to detect\nan eect of=0.20or the primary repeated-measures ANOVA analysis,\nrefecting a small-to-medium eect. For the adult sample, given the\nsame assumptions but a completer sample size o187, the study was\npowered to detect an eect o0.12, a small eect.\n3. Results\n3.1. Diagnosis and treatment history\nOver halothe parent sample endorsed a diagnosisor their child\nrom a proessional (n=84, 60 %), with the most common diagnosing\nproessionals being audiologists, psychologists, and primary care phy-\nsicians. Sel-diagnosis was more common in the adult sample, with only\n21 % (n=53) reporting they had been diagnosed by a healthcare pro-\nessional. Among those who were diagnosed, therequency odiagnoses\nrom dierent proessionals was similar, though adults endorsed a\ndiagnosisrom a psychiatrist relatively more oten (15 % oadults who\nhad been diagnosed vs. 6 % oyouth). Please see Table 2 or aull\nsummary.\nThe treatments/management strategies that had been most\nrequently tried were liestyle modications (96 % oparents endorsed\nhaving tried this strategy, 89 % oadults),ollowed by audiologic\ntreatments (93 % and 87 %) and psychological therapies (89 % and 69\n%). The next most popular treatment categories included relaxation (69\n% and 70 %), supplements (58 % and 49 %), and psychotropic media-\ntions (44 % and 50 %). Neuromodulation was used lessrequently (9 %\nand 11 %). Active and passive noise cancelling were the most common\naudiologic treatments; home rearrangement and modied event plan-\nning were the most common liestyle modications. Supportive therapy,\nmindulness/acceptance-based therapy, and cognitive-behavioral ther-\napy were the most used psychological treatments.

Regarding gender dierences,emale adult partici-\npants rated medications as signicantly more appropriate than non-\nemales,t(212)=2.33, p=.024,d=0.48, and showed a similar\npattern with supplement ratings,t(208)=2.09, p=.038,d=0.38.\nParents o emale children also rated supplements as signicantly more\nappropriate,t(117)=2.23, p=.027,d=0.48. Other gender dierences\nwere not signicant (please contact authorsor statistical details).\nSee Table 4 or a summary omean comparisons otreatment\nappropriateness ratings among those who hadversus had not tried a\ngiven treatmentamily, separated by parent-report and adult sel-report.\nParent- and adult sel-report responses showed a similar pattern osig-\nnicance and eect size in this analysis: appropriateness ratings were\nsignicantly higher among those who had tried psychotropic medica-\ntions, supplements, and audiologic treatments, but there were not sig-\nnicant dierences in appropriateness ratingsor relaxation or\npsychological treatment. Liestyle modications were rated as more\nappropriate by adults who had tried these strategies. Insucient\nnumbers oparents reported not having tried liestyle modications (n\n=6), audiologic treatments (n=8), or having tried neuromodulation (n\n=10), to conduct comparisons.4. Discussion\nThis study investigated the treatment experiences and preerences o\na large online sample oparents ochildren with misophonia and adults\nwith sel-reported misophonia. Most adults and a large portion ochil-\ndren were not proessionally diagnosed with misophonia. The majority\noboth parent and adult participants were not satised with misophonia\ntreatments they or their children had previously received. Liestyle\nmodications and audiological treatments involving noise cancellation\nwere perceived as the most appropriate treatments. Medications were\nperceived as less appropriate and exposure therapy as least appropriate\namong both groups.\nAmong participants who sought proessional helpor their miso-\nphonia oror their child's misophonia, most utilized psychologists or\naudiologists. These proessionals may be more likely to encounter in-\ndividuals with misophonia in their practice. However, most participants\nwere sel-diagnosed.\nWithew exceptions (relaxation strategies, psychological treatment,\nand neuromodulation), participants who had tried a given treatment\ngenerally rated it as more appropriateness, though the direction othis\nassociation cannot be determined with this study, as it is likely that\npeople who perceive certain treatments as more appropriate are more\nlikely to try them, though it is also possible that their perceptions o\nappropriateness increased ater trying a given treatment approach. It is\ninteresting that individuals who had tried psychotherapy did not rate it\nas more appropriate than individuals who had not tried psychotherapy\n(parents and adults); when compared with signicant dierences in\nother treatment categories, thisurther highlights the inadequate ex-\nperiences individuals have had in therapyor misophonia.\nFindings suggest strong desire by participants to engage in treatment,\nthough almost haldescribed dissatisaction with the treatment options\nthey have previously pursued. Notably, when those who responded\n“neither satised nor dissatised” are included, over haloparticipants\nwere not satised with available treatmentsor misophonia. It is\napparent that there is a discrepancy between what patients' desire and\nwhat is available to them in theorm otreatments. This could be related\nto a lack otreatment response. The survey results also indicate that\nthere is still a signicant needor development oeective therapiesor\nmisophonia.\nOverall, audiologic treatments and liestyle modications were both\nthe most popular and perceived to be the most appropriate treatments.\nAmong audiologic interventions, active noise cancelling (addition o\nsound stimuli) and passive noise cancelling (sound protection such as\near plugs or headphones) were rated as most appropriate. The high\nappropriateness ratings onoise cancelling interventions and liestyle\nmodications suggest that individuals with misophonia prioritize\nsymptom management. The community seems to view misophonia as a\nchronic disorder to be managed rather than a condition that can be\ntreated, but this view is likely aected by a general lack omisophonia-\nspecic treatments. These views and perceptions may be investigated\nurther in theuture.\nMedications were rated as less appropriate than other treatments\namong both parents and adults, which may refect the lack origorous\npharmacotherapy trials with misophonia as the primary target. The least\nappropriate treatmentor both adults and children with misophonia was\nexposure therapy. Onote, exposure therapy was listed and described\nseparatelyrom CBT, which oten includes this therapeutic approach.\nThus, participants may have responded to CBT thinking that exposure\ntherapy was a component othis treatment. On balance, CBT includes a\nnumber ocomponents (e.g., cognitive restructuring, coping skills;\nLewin et al., 2014a, 2014b ) and real-world CBT oten does not include\nexposure ( Whiteside et al., 2020 ).\nFor youth, psychological treatment was almost asrequently used\ncompared with others listed on the survey, although it was not perceived\nto be a signicantly more appropriate treatment approach.

This highlights the need to engage individuals\nliving with misophonia in the development opsychological therapies\nor this condition to ensure that they match the values and perspective o\nthis community. Indeed, there are two ongoing trials testing various\norms ocognitive-behavioral therapyor misophonia ( Cecilione et al.,\n2021 ;Lewin et al., 2021 ), which build on prior results ( Jager et al.,\n2020 ). Understanding the core treatment components oa cognitive-\nbehaviorally oriented treatment protocol is highlighted as an area in\nneed o urther study and stakeholder engagement. For example, expo-\nsure therapy in its currentorm is generally considered dissatisying and\noveremphasis othis treatment methodology could alienate some\nmembers othe community. Thesendings also underscore the needor\ninterdisciplinary treatment eorts that emphasize audiologic, psycho-\nlogical, neurological and psychiatric perspectives to provide a range o\ntreatment options that match patient preerences, as well as comparative\neectiveness studies to determine the most ecacious approaches.\nAdults reported lessavorable views towards psychological treat-\nment. Although 69 % reported trying someorm opsychotherapy, it\nwas rated as signicantly less appropriate than other treatment ap-\nproaches listed on the survey. It is worth noting, however, that the\noverall psychological treatment appropriateness mean rating may have\nbeen an underestimate othe perceived appropriateness omore specictypes opsychotherapy as this category included a number otreatments\nrated as highly appropriate (e.g., CBT, mindulness and acceptance-\nbased therapy) that were averaged with therapies with signicantly\nlower appropriateness ratings (e.g., exposure therapy and equine-\nassisted therapy).\n4.1. Limitations\nThere are several study limitations. First, most participants were sel-\ndiagnosed with misophonia and misophonia symptom severity was sel-\nreported; it would have been preerable to use a validated scale such as\nthe Amsterdam Misophonia Scale. Results may also be biased ipartic-\nipants with higher levels oeducation and ocertain ethnicities were\nover-represented due to levels oawareness omisophonia. Because the\nsurvey did not ask detailed questions about participants' symptoms,\nthere may be diversity in symptoms leading to variation in appropri-\nateness odierent treatments. Second, individuals with more severe\nmisophonia symptoms may be more likely to participate in treatment\nresearch and may have been more likely to take and complete this study\nsurvey (as evidenced by the misophonia severity ratings that skewed\ntowards the more severe). Third, participants were included based on\nsel-reported misophonia symptoms. It is likely that some also presented\nwith comorbid medical or psychiatric diagnosis which could impact sel-\nreports. Fourth, there were no checks on participant comprehension o\nsurvey items. Finally, because othe descriptive nature othis study, we\nchose to use a completer-only approach to ensure the data refect the\ntrue responses oparticipants, though this did result in a considerable\nproportion omissing data. In summary, clinicians and researchers are at\nthe early stages oestablishing evidence-based treatmentsor in-\ndividuals with misophonia. Although there are some data to suggest CBT\nis eective in reducing misophonia symptoms, our survey indicates in-\ndividuals may preer liestyle changes or audiologic interventions most.\nParticipants seemed most consistently wary opsychotropic medications\nand supplements. Also signicant is thending that over haloboth\nadult and parent respondents were not satised with the misophonia\ntreatments they tried. These views should be interpreted in the light oa\ngeneral lack omisophonia-specic intervention options. In that regard,\ninterventionsor misophonia dierrom the availability omore specic\nor holistic treatmentsor other disorders. Clinicians and researchers may\nconsider thesendings when approaching conversations with patients\nor when planninguture research into treatmentsor misophonia.\nRegardless, more research is needed to determine which treatment\nstrategies are most eectiveor misophonia symptoms as well as which\ntreatments are preerred and utilized. Future research should consider\nthe eect ocomorbid psychiatric conditions on individuals' perceptions\nodierent treatment strategiesor misophonia.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nEleanor E.A.
