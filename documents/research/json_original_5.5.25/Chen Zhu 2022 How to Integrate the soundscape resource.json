Although the sound -\nscape concept and approach have considered natural sounds as a resource, the related knowledge has not been \nemployed in landscape planning yet. The purpose of this study is to advance existing state of knowledge to \nsynthesize common preferences for soundscape resources, and then to propose an assessment method for \nlandscape planning. We introduce a planning-oriented soundscape resource evaluation framework to guide a \nPRISMA systematic literature review. The review includes an in-depth analysis of 74 peer-reviewed journal \narticles and a meta-analysis for 21 of them. We find that (1) current research has under-explored the soundscape \nwith regard to spatiotemporal evolution, health benefits, and preferences and values; (2) in green spaces, people \nfrom different sociocultural contexts exhibit common preferences for soundscape resources. According to these, \nsoundscape formal characters tend towards naturalness, diversity, and appropriateness; (3) exposure to natural \nsounds does have positive effects on human health and well-being, but the degree of the effects was varied. In \naddition to birdsongs and water sounds, wind-induced vegetation sounds also have high values. Based on these \nfindings, we suggest basic natural sound scores and categorized indicators for evaluating NSES. It can be \nimplemented in Geographic Information System to produce place-based and comparable results under uncer -\ntainty. The results can help landscape planners better consider the contribution of the acoustic environment to \nhuman health, well-being, and quality of life, protect the areas of high-quality soundscape resources without \nactual human uses, and reveal the differences between the actual provision of aesthetic values and demands for \nnature-based recreation.   \n1.Introduction \nNatural sounds have been neglected in landscape planning (LP) until \nnow, in spite of their obvious positive impact on people ’s health and \nwell-being (Aletta et al., 2018; Derryberry et al., 2020; Tong and Kang, \n2021 ). This is surprising, because LP as a strong forward-looking action \nto enhance, restore, and create landscapes (Council of European, 2000 ), \nis concerned with protecting natural processes and significant cultural \nand natural assets (Ogrin, 2010 ). Natural sounds and their compositions \nare part of those valuable assets, because they are a dynamic property \nand resource of ecosystems (Carson, 1962 ), which are worthy of pro-\ntection in many national parks, reserves, and wilderness areas (NPS, \n2006; Harbrow et al., 2011; Gale et al., 2021 ). In order to protect landscape assets, functions or ecosystem services (ES), LP evaluates \ndifferent qualities of biodiversity and ES including landscape aesthetic \nquality (LAQ) (Hermes et al., 2018 ), assesses impacts of existing and \nplanned land uses (Mace et al., 1999 ), and proposes measures for \nlandscape restoration (de Groot et al., 2010 ). Whereas current LP or \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA), especially the LAQ assessment, \nonly considers the impact of noise, the natural sounds, positively \nperceived by people and as an essential motivation to visit natural areas \n(Wenny et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019 ), are not included in the assessment. \nThese gaps not only waste an opportunity for strengthening the argu-\nments for protecting valuable ecosystems and landscapes, but also \ndeprive the quality of natural environment of an effective protection \nthat may importantly contribute to human nature-based experiences and \n*Corresponding author at: Leibniz University Hannover, Institute of Environmental Planning, Herrenh auser Str. 2, 30419 Hanover, Germany. \nE-mail addresses: chen@umwelt.uni-hannover.de (Z.

However, although \nCICES V5.1 (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2018 ) has talked about the \nenjoyed sounds in the group “physical and experiential interactions with \nnatural environment ”, natural sounds still do not receive enough \nattention in the ES context. The concept of “soundscape ” (ISO, 2014 ) is \nhelpful for improving such a state, since it emphasizes the relationship \nbetween human perception and the acoustic environment, and chiefly \nfocuses on the meaningful sound compositions rather than equating \nsounds with noises (Brown et al., 2011 ). In fact, similar to natural \nlandscapes, the natural soundscape resource contributes to providing \nthe setting or condition that enables aesthetic experiences and nature- \nbased recreation activities (Axelsson, 2015; Hong et al., 2019b; Liu \net al., 2019 ), therefore promoting people ’s health and well-being \n(Barber et al., 2016 ). Such benefits afforded to people by nature \nbelong to the ES realm (Bratman et al., 2012; Francis et al., 2017 ). In this \ncontext, natural sound and soundscape resources should be treated as an \nintegral part of biodiversity (Davies et al., 2020; Holgate et al., 2021 ) \nand ES (MEA, 2005; TEEB, 2010 ), especially cultural ecosystem services \n(CES) in LP. \nIn order to find a methodological way to include natural sounds and \nsound compositions into LP, we have to understand how LP basically \nworks and where possible entry points are. Methodologically, LP in-\ncorporates the evaluation of landscape functions (as of yet ES and \nbiodiversity), projecting possible changes of landscape (values), \ndeducting objectives and measures to maintain landscape qualities (ES), \nand restoring them with regard to driving forces, pressures and impacts of landscape change (Albert et al., 2016 ). To this end, modelling in \nGeographic Information System (GIS) is employed, which is based on a \nset of practice-oriented methods (Haaren et al., 2019 ) and usually based \non easily derived spatial information. This under-complex modelling is \nnecessary, because LP has to bridge the gap between science and prac-\ntical implementation, thus having to produce place-based, comparable \n(scaled) results under uncertainty (Neuendorf et al., 2018 ). Compara -\nbility of ES values and impairments is needed in practice to derive pri-\norities for actions and to define the space for public participation. \nAgainst this backdrop, an approach to sound assessment will also possess \nsuch abilities and is preferably based on readily available information. \nIntegration of natural sounds into LP thus should be sought both in as-\nsessments of LAQ and in EIAs, if soundscape resources are threatened by \nplanned land use changes or already deteriorated. Such integration of-\nfers the chance to improve the aesthetic value (Wang and Zhao, 2019 ) as \nwell as the quality of nature-based recreation (Liu et al., 2018a ), thus \nproviding restorative benefits for individuals and collectives (Fisher \net al., 2021 ). In general, it may contribute to the conservation of the \nnatural environment (Doser et al., 2020 ). Finally, landscape planners \ncan deduce sound-related objectives and measures and therefore \ncommunicate with stakeholders. \nHowever, it remains insufficient that the state of knowledge \nregarding methods for incorporating the assessment of soundscape re-\nsources into planning phases, since established methods and standards \nare only for assessing disturbing noise. For instance, the Environmental \nNoise Directive (END 2002/49/EC ) was the first EU policy concerning the \nassessment and management of environmental noise (Directive, 2002 ). \nBased on this, the Good Practice Guides were published to help related \nauthorities undertake noise mapping (WG-AEN, 2006 ) and quiet area \nFig. 1.The Planning-oriented Soundscape Resource Evaluation (PSRE) framework (adapted from Haaren et al., 2014; Albert et al., 2016 ) with the mechanism of \njudgment for common preferences of soundscape resources (based on ISO, 2014, 2018, 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2019 ).

Similar regulations also exist in, e.g., Ger-\nmany (TA Larm, 1998 ), the US (Menge et al., 1998 ), the UK (Defra, \n2010 ), and China (HJ 2.4, 2009 ). Nevertheless, all of these solely focus \non noise aspects. Only recently, the Welsh government published the \nNoise and Soundscape Action Plan, which firstly involves the soundscape \nmatter (Welsh Government, 2018 ), but only introduces the masking \neffect of the natural soundscape on noises. On the other hand, scientists \nhave gradually made progress in identifying positive aspects of the \nsoundscapes (van Kempen et al., 2014; Aletta et al., 2018; Hong et al., \n2020a ). A good example is the Positive Soundscape Project , which ac-\nknowledges the importance of positive soundscapes in urban planning \n(Davies et al., 2007 ), but is still inadequate in evaluating the soundscape \nresources of nature for LP. A major current limitation is that existing \nsoundscape approaches, such as interviews, soundwalks, and laboratory \nexperiments (ISO, 2018 ), are mainly based on individuals ’ responses to \nsoundscape features. Besides, they are weather-dependent, time- \nconsuming, and cost-intensive (Votsi et al., 2017 ). Despite such pro-\ngresses having made contributions to noise mitigation and expanded \nconcerns about positive sounds, they are not planning-oriented and the \nresults are neither comparable nor across LP spatial units (e.g., biotope \nor habitat), and they do not fully explore the potential of integrating \nnatural sounds into LP from ES perspectives (Haaren et al., 2019 ). \nThe aim of this paper is to review and advance the state of knowledge \nregarding the evaluation of soundscape resources for LP. To this end, we \n(1) provide a planning-oriented soundscape resource evaluation (PSRE) \nframework based on a practice-oriented ES evaluation model (Haaren \net al., 2014; Albert et al., 2016 ), to consider the soundscape resource \nevaluation from the ES perspective, (2) conduct a PSRE-guiding sys-\ntematic review to synthesize evidence of people ’s preferences for \nsoundscape compositions in green spaces, and to examine the values of \nvarious natural sounds, based on the effect sizes of natural sounds on \nhuman health and well-being, and (3) discuss review results and then \npropose an initial assessment approach, which could be a supplement to \nthe current LAQ assessment and EIAs in LP. \n2.Towards a Planning-oriented soundscape resource evaluation \n(PSRE) framework \nWe adapted the practice-oriented ES evaluation (PRESET) model to \ninclude and highlight the evaluation of soundscape resource in order to \nset up a “Planning-oriented Soundscape Resource Evaluation (PSRE) ” \nframework (Fig. 1). The main features of this PSRE are outlined as fol-\nlows. The center is nature-based soundscape ecosystem services (NSES), \na CES (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2018 ), that can be understood as the \ndirect and indirect contributions from soundscape resources of ecosys -\ntems to humans (MEA, 2005; TEEB, 2010 ). It consists of both those \n“offered ” by ecosystems and those actually “utilized ” by humans (Albert \net al., 2016 ). The offered NSES represents the aesthetic pleasure that \narises from the state of harmony between the imaginative representation \nof soundscape resources (a Natural Capital) and people ’s understanding. \nSuch pleasure may provide benefits to people but not necessarily \ncurrently utilized (Haaren et al., 2014 ). This means that the offered \nNSES is a special “formal quality ” dependent on the perceptual prop-\nerties of soundscape resources, as is the case with LAQ (Hermes et al., \n2018 ). It is a formal purposiveness but not of function — purposiveness \nwithout purpose (Lothian, 1999 ). Utilized NSES are those that are \nactually enjoyed and/or appreciated by humans. The use may encom -\npass various activities that range from walking, hiking, and cycling in \n(semi-) natural surroundings to consciously experiencing soundscape \nresources, and such use may require human inputs (Haaren et al., 2014 ). \nThis differentiation is important for planning as it allows for protecting \nhigh quality areas based on the public ’s benefits even without actual \nuses. It also reveals the difference between high demand for nature- \nbased recreation and the actual provision of LAQ in areas such as \nurban fringes or countryside. \nWe recommend, as a first explorative approach, applying intersubjective values instead of the non-use value proposed in the \noriginal PRESET concept (Haaren et al., 2014 ). The reason is that CES \nnorms expressed in international legislation are non-existent for evalu -\nating NSES. Intersubjective values (not objectively proven as generally \napplicable but agreed upon by a majority of people) can refer to core \npreferences of soundscape compositions for the offered NSES that may \neven be common to all human beings (Hermes et al., 2018; Haaren et al., \n2019 ). This core can be deduced from the existing literature, and used to \ncompare and rate offered NSES in different areas as an initial criterion. \nThis can inform planning decisions in terms of protecting and main -\ntaining soundscape resources, and developing the tourism potential of a \nregion. In addition, individual, local values and preferences can be \ncaptured by economic values that are primarily related to the utilized \nNSES and obtaining benefits (Albert et al., 2016 ). The valuation results \nof utilized NSES can be compared with the offered NSES for planning \npurposes. \nIn addition, a judgment mechanism is employed here to indicate how \nto determine the common preferences for soundscape resources. Pref-\nerences and perception are neither synonymous nor two separate di-\nmensions. In fact, the perception process (auditory sensation and \ninterpretation of it), generating responses that may have outcomes (ISO, \n2014; Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019 ), is the cognitive foun-\ndation that can influence preferences (Istv˘an, 2003 ). An important point \nto note here is that perception - the way people perceive a soundscape - \nis a process. It is influenced but not exclusively determined by the \nacoustic environment and context. Conversely, preferences are more \ndirectly related to the physical elements of the soundscape, such as \nliking or disliking the attributes of a certain soundscape element through \nthe use (e.g., identifying, listening, or experiencing) of the acoustic \nenvironment. In this case, determining common soundscape preferences \nshould also include the potential precursors that lead to preferences, i.e., \nresponses and outcomes (Brown et al., 2011 ). \n3.Method \nOur systematic review adheres to the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred \nReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method \n(Page et al., 2021 ). This approach is considered reliable and transparent \nin terms of collecting scientific evidence based on specific research \nquestions (Mallett et al., 2012 ) and has also been used for relevant ev-\nidence collection for soundscape studies (Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian \net al., 2019; Lionello et al., 2020 ). It reduces sampling bias by capturing \nall relevant empirical evidence, and it clearly articulates the eligibility \ncriteria for each step, which allows verification and replication by other \nresearchers (Liberati et al., 2009 ). The PSRE framework served as a \nguidance for the PRISMA-based systematic review. \n3.1. Eligibility criteria and search strategy \nThe specific inclusion criteria included: (1) studies should include at \nleast one measure for the determinants of common soundscape prefer -\nence; (2) studies should be observed in at least one green space \n(ecosystem) that can generate natural sounds, regardless of whether \nthey are real, recorded, or virtual (ISO, 2018 ); and (3) reviewed papers \nshould be published in an accessible peer-reviewed journal and written \nin English (Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019 ). Based on the \nmechanism of judgment (Fig. 1), the common preference for soundscape \nresources is determined by: (1) direct preferences: like/dislike or prefer/ \nnot prefer; (2) perceptual responses: positive (e.g., good, vibrant, \npleasant, calm, or similar) or negative (e.g., bad, chaotic, annoying, \nmonotonous, or similar) reactions and emotions (Axelsson et al., 2012; \nISO, 2018 ); and (3) outcomes: restorativeness, stress recovery, and \nmood state (Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, we \nargue that the effect degree of natural sound on the three aspects above \ncan be a reflection of the intersubjective values for evaluating NSES. \nEffects include improved (restorativeness and positive affection) and Z.

The search scope \n(“title”, “abstract ”, and “keywords ”) was set up for searching articles in \nboth databases. The search terms were: (“sound* ” OR “soundscape* ”) \nAND (“perceive* ” OR “percept* ” OR “prefer* ”) AND (“natur* environ -\nment* ” OR “natur* area* ” OR “natur* surrounding* ” OR “natur* \nsetting* ” OR “green* space* ” OR “green* area* ” OR “ecosystem* ” OR \n“habitat* ” OR “biotope* ”), where “*” is a wildcard character that rep-\nresents all words with the same presented roots. The time frame was limited to 1 January 1990 until 1 October 2021. Each record retrieved \nwas independently screened by the first author in accordance with in-\nclusion criteria. Automation tools were used to filter out the peer- \nreviewed journal articles. \n3.2. Study selection and data extraction protocol \nStudy selection was accomplished in three steps (Fig. 2): identifica -\ntion, screening, and inclusion. Of the 85 articles initially screened from \nthe databases, only one was not retrievable (Bjerke and Østdahl, 2005 ). \nThen, 54 eligible articles were selected after excluding 30 for specific \nreasons. Moreover, 20 additional articles that were relevant to the \nresearch questions but did not show up in the search results were added. \nUltimately, a total of 74 eligible articles were selected for evidence \nsynthesis, and 21 of them with randomized controlled trial (RCT) study \ndesign were used to perform a meta-analysis (West et al., 2008 ). The \nextracted data is shown in Table 1. \n3.3. Meta-analysis \nThe risk of bias assessment indicated that the 21 studies were of good \nquality and could be used in the meta-analysis (for details see Fig. S1, \nSupplementary material ). The values in terms of M, SD, and sample size \nof these studies were extracted to compare and statistically analyze the \neffect degree of natural sounds. We built two models for improved and \nreduced effects separately. Because these data were continuous vari-\nables with non-uniform units, we used standardized mean differences \n(SMD, Cohen ’s d) as effect size measures (Magnusson, 2014 ), and \nrandom-effects models (Higgins et al., 2003 ) for pooling the outcome \ndata of each effect separately. To account for the possibility of multiple \ncomparisons and outcomes in a single study, the study ID was included \nFig. 2.Workflow of the systematic literature based on the PRISMA approach (Page et al., 2021 ).  \nTable 1 \nData extraction details.  \nData extraction field Details to consider in data extraction \nStudy identification Locations; ecosystem/green space types \nStudy design Data collection methods; spatio-temporality of data \nSoundscape element Natural sound types; soundscape measures; \ninfluential context factors \nQualitative finding \n(All 74 articles, for \nevidence synthesis) Findings regarding people ’s perception or preferences \nfor soundscape compositions including natural sound \nsources, soundscape characteristics, and relevant \ncontexts \nNumerical value \n(The 21 articles, for meta- \nanalysis) Sample size of participants; mean value (M) and \nstandard deviation (SD) from soundscape measures in \nnatural sound exposure (experimental) groups and no \nsound or noise exposure (control) groups \nNotes : For studies that only represented required data by graphs rather than \nspecific values, we used GetData software (https://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/ \n) to extract the values for analysis (Buxton et al., 2021 ).

Both models \nshowed significant heterogeneity between effect sizes, i.e., I2 F50%, p \nD0.001. This may be due to the difference in sample size within the \nsame natural sound source. We examined publication bias by visually \nassessing funnel plots( Supplementary material , Fig. S2), which are \nscatter plots of effect sizes versus their precision (Nakagawa and Santos, \n2012 ). The scatter plots seem to indicate publication bias, which may be \nbecause natural sounds do have significant effects on human health and \nwell-being. In addition, we also performed sensitivity analysis (Copas \nand Shi, 2000 ) for both models, and all recalculated SMD values after \nremoving any of the studies were within the 95% confidence interval \n(CI) of the combined values, which implies our results are reliable and \nrobust. All statistical analyses were performed with STATA 16.0. \n4.Results \n4.1. General information \nWe extracted general information from the 74 articles included. As \nshown in Fig. 3a to 3d, more than half of the total number of studies \ncame from Europe (n 38), followed by Asia (n 19), only one study \noccurring in Australia (Uebel et al., 2021 ), but no included study was \nconducted in Africa. China (n 14) and the United Kingdom (n 10) \nwere the two countries with the highest number of studies; Germany and \nthe United States had the same number of studies (n 4). The included \nstudies more often set their study area in urban green spaces (n 52), \nand most of these occurred in urban parks (n 25). Field interviews (n \n29) and laboratory experiments (n 25) were the most commonly \nused methods to collect data; few studies (n 6) combined two ap-\nproaches to conduct experiments. Most of the data had no spatial and/or \ntemporal characteristics (n 59), and studies that considered such \naccounted for only one-fifth (n 15) of the total. \nFor the soundscape elements, we chiefly focused on extracting in-\nformation from the studies about the natural sound type (Fig. 3e), the \nsoundscape measure (Fig. 3f), and the type of associated contextual \nfactors (Fig. 3g). Usually, multiple types of natural sounds were explored \nsimultaneously in a study. Biological sounds (f 103) were studied \nmuch more often than geophysical sounds (f 60). Birdsongs and water \nsounds were the two most studied natural sound sources, with 32 and 31 times, respectively, followed by wind-induced vegetation sounds (f \n21) and wind sounds (f 18). Most studies combined at least two or \nmore measures to test human experiences in the acoustic environment. \nPerceived sound intensity/level (f 19) and identification of sound type \n(f 18) were the most frequently used measures, followed by restor -\nativeness (f 14) and semantic attributes (f 13). Most studies focused \non the perceptual responses to soundscapes, compared to soundscape \ninduced health benefits and preferences and values. The context can be \ncategorized as the place, person, and activity (ISO, 2014 ), the effects of \nwhich on soundscapes were simultaneously explored in some studies. \nPlace-related factors, e.g., naturalness, visual perception or quality, and \nlandscape morphology or pattern, were studied most frequently (f 97). \n4.2. Evidence of soundscape compositions that people preferred \nThe research evidence suggests that people have common prefer -\nences but also differences due to their cultural backgrounds. We classi -\nfied preferences into three main categories based on the perceptual \nconstruct of soundscape (ISO, 2014 ), including natural sound sources, \nsoundscape characteristics, and contextual features (for details see \nTable S1, Supplementary material ). Each type contains many general \npreferences, along with some special findings that arise in certain con-\nditions, such as specific places, human groups, or human-nature in-\nteractions. In subcategories, single types of natural sounds and \nlandscape aesthetics are the most studied subcategories, followed by \nnatural sound combinations, and physical features and perceptual at-\ntributes of soundscapes. A small number of studies focused on contextual \nelements such as biodiversity, proximity, temporal or seasonal changes, \nand infrastructure. \n4.3. Effects of natural sounds on human health and well-being \nThe two effect models are shown in Fig. 4. Multi-species birdsongs \nare those explicitly stated or unspecified species in the studies; single- \nspecies birdsongs are those coming from only one type of songbird; \nsounds of domestic animals come from unspecified animals that were in \nvillages; mixed natural sounds represent the combination of more than \none type of natural sound, or natural sounds without explicitly indicated \ntypes. \nFig. 4.Mean effect sizes of natural sounds on improving restorativeness and positive affection and reducing stress and negative mood.

Dog barking \nexhibited the weakest improved effect (0.45, 95% CI 0.27, 0.64). \nAlthough a reduced effect result was obtained for the frog croaking \n(-0.30, 95% CI -1.44, 0.83), its 95% CI intersected with the null line, \nrepresenting that the result was not statistically significant, i.e., the frog \ncroaking may not have a substantial influence on human health and \nwell-being. Regarding the reduced effects model, water sounds had the \nstrongest reduced effect (-2.33, 95% CI -3.00, \u00001.67), followed by \nmixed natural sounds (-1.99, 95% CI -2.95, \u00001.04). However, in \ncontrast to the performance in the improved effect, multi-species bird-\nsongs presented the weakest effect in reduction (-0.77, 95% CI -1.09, \n\u00000.45). \n5.Discussion \n5.1. Theory: Framework for integrating natural sounds in landscape \nplanning \nIn this study, a PSRE framework was introduced as a methodology \nfor incorporating soundscape resources into LP. The framework is based \non the PRESET model (Haaren et al., 2014; Albert et al., 2016 ) and \nconsiders the soundscape assessment from an ES perspective so that it \ncan be more smoothly and closely linked to established LP tools. This \nframework incorporates natural sound sources, differentiated NSES, \nrelevant human inputs, and potential benefits of NSES. It indicates the \ninterrelationships between these components, and theoretically they can \nbe evaluated using separate indicators. This differentiated approach \nsuggests that a portion of the NSES, namely the offered NSES, is already \nincluded in planning considerations and is therefore more adaptable to \nthe established planning process. In this way, based on the ES-in- \nPlanning framework (Albert et al., 2016 ), predicting future states of \nthe soundscape resources becomes possible. Such prediction can help \ncapture the effects of land use planning, change, or degradation on the \nvalues of soundscape resources. With the support of PSRE, landscape \nplanners can not only effectively identify and evaluate high-value \nsoundscape resources, but also develop conservation measures, even \nin the absence of human use. These processes can also reveal the \ndiscrepancy between actual aesthetic value provision and recreational \nneeds in the area, and description of the results can be incorporated into \nthe public participation. In addition, PSRE broadens the framework of \nISO 12,913 (ISO, 2014, 2018 ) by suggesting concerns in terms of the \nmonetary and non-monetary values of soundscapes, as well as health \nbenefits from soundscape, so that landscape planners and researchers \ncan realize the deeper contributions of soundscape resources. \n5.2. Evidence: common soundscape preferences \n5.2.1. Current challenges for introducing soundscape into landscape \nplanning \nAs presented in the characteristics of the included studies (Fig. 3), for \nthe purpose of including soundscape evaluation in LP, some shortcom -\nings in the focuses and research methods still exist. First, limitations still \nexist in the selection of study area. Due to the differences in socio- \ncultural backgrounds, cross-regional studies can provide more compre -\nhensive information for planning (Jeon et al., 2018 ), thus improving the rationality of planning objectives setting, especially in developed \ncountries with diverse populations, such as Germany (Green, 2013 ). In \naddition, the concerns are mostly located in urban green spaces. How-\never, natural green spaces also provide rich soundscape resources but \ncould suffer from some negative effects (Abbott et al., 2016 ), which fall \nunder the scope of Nature-based solution (NBS) (Hanson et al., 2020 ). LP \ncan provide complementary contributions to NBS (Albert et al., 2019 ), \ntherefore a greater focus on the soundscape of natural green spaces in \nthe context of LP can also contribute to the development and imple -\nmentation of NBS. \nSecond, the studies lacked expansion based on ISO 12913-2 (ISO, \n2018 ) in terms of data collection and studied sound types. Most included \nstudies evaluated the acoustic environment by collecting people ’s re-\nsponses through questionnaires. Although this is the advocated \napproach, it still suffers from being time-consuming and labor-intensive \n(EEA, 2014 ). This issue may also potentially limit the ongoing explo -\nration and evaluation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the soundscape. \nFor the studied sound sources, less attention has been paid to specific \nspecies or types of sound sources that fall under main sound categories. \nFor example, different species of birdsongs (Zhao et al., 2020 ), or \ndifferent types of water sounds such as ocean, stream, and waterfall \nsounds (Galbrun and Ali, 2013; Rådsten-Ekman et al., 2013 ). Such \nprecise classification may lead to different physiological and psycho -\nlogical reactions in humans. \nThird, few studies focused on human value and preferences, health, \nand well-being for soundscapes. Such aspects are not even mentioned in \nthe ISO 12913 documents (ISO, 2014, 2018, 2019 ), nonetheless it is \nparticularly important in ES-informed LP. Because LP is more concerned \nwith the public preferences, needs, and well-being, it evaluates and se-\nlects valuable natural resources based on collective values (Haaren et al., \n2019 ). For incorporating into LP, soundscape researchers should expand \nthe study horizon and applicable indicators, and summarize the general \npublic values and preferences (Hermes et al., 2018 ), so as to interface \nwell with planning rules and also be able to advance relevant legislation \nand policy development. \n5.2.2. Formal characteristics of soundscape resources based on common \npreferences \nOur evidence synthesis essentially responds to some findings from \nprevious studies. It suggests that people have common core preferences \nof soundscape compositions for NSES. In addition, people with different \nsociocultural backgrounds may differ in the degree of preference (e.g., \nthe difference between liking very much and liking in general). Based on \nthe evidence, the formal characteristics of soundscape resources can \nconverge into three categories: naturalness, diversity, and \nappropriateness. \nThe naturalness of the soundscape is considered by Carles et al. \n(1999) to be one of the most important components of the soundscape \npreference, which is consistent with our results. We argue that natu-\nralness is rather a “fundamental ” characteristic from which a variety of \npositive attributes (e.g., pleasantness and calmness) can be derived. The \nevidence indicates that the naturalness is highly dependent on the type \nor dominance of the natural sounds that comprise soundscapes (Benfield \net al., 2010; P˘erez-Martínez et al., 2018 ), which may explain in part why \nthe natural sounds provide many positive attributes. Nevertheless, not \nall types of natural sounds can be perceived positively. The evidence \nshows that humans generally dislike dog barking and frog croaking (Liu \net al., 2019; Wang and Zhao, 2019 ), which may be because they make \npeople feel noisy and unsafe. In general, such animals need to ward off \nenemies by raising their voices when threatened or attacked. However, \nsuch aversion can be mitigated after adding preferred natural sounds. \nThis phenomenon can be regarded as a positive “masking effect ”, and it \nis generally accepted that natural sound source combinations have a \nhigh degree of harmony (Liu et al., 2018b; Hong et al., 2019a ). These \nmay be expressions of the naturalness. Therefore, the role of soundscape \nnaturalness as an integral part of landscape naturalness should receive Z. Chen et al."

In fact, these two can be discussed together. For \ninstance, some evidence suggests that birdsongs of different species \nvaried from hardness and timbres, leading to the perception of either \nfriendliness or aggression (Ratcliffe et al., 2013 ). In addition, the com-\nbination of bird calls from different species can present variable acoustic \nfeatures (e.g., with regard to frequencies or fluctuation strengths) and is \nmore likely to be appreciated (Hong et al., 2021 ). We speculate that \npeople may be able to perceive the energetic atmosphere or euphoric \nstate of mind due to exposure to such sounds. This may also be a possible \nreason why humans prefer multi-species birdsongs to single-species \nbirdsongs. Theoretically, the preference for vegetation sounds of \ndifferent species can also be explored. However, most of the vegetation \nis planted in combination, and it may be difficult to distinguish species- \nspecific vegetation sounds. Interestingly, one study found that humans \ncannot identify more than four types of bird sounds simultaneously \n(Hong et al., 2021 ), which indicates that current data collection methods \nmay be flawed in exploring the diversity of soundscapes. \nFurthermore, we suggest focusing on the appropriateness of the \nsoundscape based on the evidence synthesis, which is consistent with \nAxelsson ’s conclusion (Axelsson, 2015 ). Appropriateness focuses more \non how the soundscape interacts with the non-acoustic environment, \nand can provide information beyond whether the soundscape is good or \nbad. It can be reflected in the soundscape spatial and temporal di-\nmensions, and the soundscape and human multi-sensory interactions. \nFor the spatial dimension, natural sounds are appropriate for green \nspaces. The evidence demonstrates that the magnitude of natural sound \nlevels in green spaces does not reduce human preferences (Nicolosi \net al., 2021; Uebel et al., 2021 ) and may even contribute to tranquility \n(Liu et al., 2018b ). We speculate that it may be because the natural \nsounds provide a high level of perceived naturalness, which is an \nimportant metric for calculating tranquility (Watts and Marafa, 2017 ). \nAssuming that the sound pressure level is kept within a certain range \n(Watts and Pheasant, 2015 ), even relatively loud natural sounds can \nenhance the tranquility of green spaces. For the temporal dimension, \nsome sounds have been found to be better suited to particular seasons, \nsuch as woodpecker sounds in summer and sparrow sounds in winter \n(Putman and Blumstein, 2019 ). Such vocalization depend largely on the \nhabits and needs of the singer (Hao et al., 2021 ). For multi-sensory in-\nteractions, the evidence indicates that good visual quality, consistency \nin audio-visual or audio-visual-olfactory, and good provision of service \nfacilities can all contribute to soundscape quality (Hong et al., 2020b; \nZhao et al., 2020; Kogan et al., 2021 ). \n5.2.3. Quantified common preferences for various natural sounds \nThe results of the meta-analysis indicate that exposure to nature sounds has positive effects on human health and well-being, which is \nconsistent with those of previous studies (Bratman et al., 2012; Swaffield \nand McWilliam, 2013; Buxton et al., 2021 ). This finding, when inter-\npreted from an evolutionary perspective (Katcher and Wilkins, 1993 ), \nsuggests that humans are instinctively concerned with the safety pro-\nvided by the environment in which they reside. Preferred natural \nsoundscapes may provide a safe and orderly environment (Wang and \nZhao, 2019; Fisher et al., 2021 ), in which people can more easily control \ntheir emotional state and find mental nourishment and satisfaction. \nConversely, people may dislike an acoustic environment that lacks \nnatural sounds or delivers disturbing information (as described in Sec-\ntion 5.2.2 ), because such surrounding may cause people to experience \nincreased mental tension and stress. This also reflects another determi -\nnant “alarm ” of soundscape preference proposed by Carles et al. (1999) . \nThe data show that multi-species birdsongs and water sounds possess \nthe greatest improved and reduced effect sizes, respectively (Fig. 4), \nwhich more objectively echoes some findings that bird and water sounds \nare the most preferred types of natural sounds (Krzywicka and Byrka, \n2017; Liu et al., 2019 ). However, our results are not entirely consistent \nwith the findings of Buxton et al. (2021) . We speculate the differences \narise from two possible sources: On the one hand, the studied types of \nsound sources were different. We focused on all types of natural sounds \nexamined in green spaces instead of just bird and water sounds, and bird \nsounds were further distinguished from single and multiple species in \nour study. On the other hand, the included outcomes were different. We \ncompletely considered all possible outcomes that determine common \npreferences based on PSRE, but Buxton et al. focused only on the health \noutcomes. Nonetheless, we also have similar findings. For the acquired \ndataset, we shared the same finding as Buxton et al.: the supporting data \nfor the reduced model were smaller than those of the improved model. \nThis again echoes our discussion in Section 5.2.1 . \nAdditionally, we unexpectedly found that wind-induced vegetation \nsounds outperformed even water sounds in the improved effect model \n(Fig. 4). The vegetation sound, like birdsong, is also an important rep-\nresentation of biodiversity (Ng et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, we found no \nmention of vegetation sounds in the natural sound category proposed by \nISO 12913 -2 (ISO, 2018 ). Even though Fig. 3e shows that there were \nmany studies measuring vegetation sounds, in the review process we \nfound that few of them considered and discussed deeply. In addition, \nsmall amount of the data for the reduced model (Fig. 4) delivers a similar \ninformation to Fig. 3f, namely that most of the current studies are only at \nthe perception stage and do not further consider soundscape health or \nsoundscape values and preferences. The results of the reduced model \nalso quantitatively illustrate that perceiving nature sounds are stress- \nreducing and relaxing, which may also explain their contribution to \ntranquility (Section 5.2.2 ). Besides, the performances of mixed natural \nsounds in the two models (Fig. 4) echo the speculation in Section 5.2.2 : \nThe positive “masking effect ” and high harmony produced by the \ncombined natural sounds. The results of meta-analysis can be considered \nas a proxy for intersubjective values, thus providing the basic data base \nfor determining the public general preferences for natural sound \nsources. \n5.3. Application: basic natural sound scores and proposed indicators for \nassessing NSES \nBased on our results, we suggest a relatively rough but effective \napproach to NSES evaluation. In the context of LP, the soundscape re-\nsources of any given ecosystem should be able to be modeled and \nmapped based on geographic data and landscape ecological knowledge. \nTherefore, we are committed to constructing a preliminary but generally \napplicable standardized evaluation, including: (1) an assignment of \nvalue scores to natural sounds (Table 2), derived from the outcomes of \nthe two effect models, and (2) a series of proposed indicators for \nassessing differentiated NSES (Table 3), classified according to the PSRE \nframework and corresponding to soundscape common preferences.

The \nnatural breaks (jenks) method was employed for the division of the \nvalue score, which aims to maximize the variation among each category \n(Chen et al., 2013). Due to the research limitations mentioned above, the \npreliminary evaluation methods suggested here are temporarily unable \nto achieve a very detailed distinction across species of sound sources. \nTo spatially evaluate NSES, Table 2 and Table 3 should be combined. \nTable 2 is able to examine the initial values of identified natural sounds. \nThe indicators in Table 3 are used to assess the “simulated” values \n(based on the initial values) of such sounds in a spatial unit (e.g., \nbiotope) of a given green space. Because such values or preferences of \nsounds for people may change due to variations in soundscape charac -\nteristics and contextual factors in a place. Theoretically, natural sounds \nor soundscapes with their value scores can be located and assigned to \nspatial units in GIS, and the relevant components can be layered, \nsuperimposed, and evaluated through spatial analysis methods, if the \nrequired indicators are filled by specific metrics. However, the selection \nof such metrics is beyond the scope of this study, but we will carry out \nthe exploration in the subsequent research. Also, a spatial sound database, or called the “audiotope”, that contains corresponding re-\ncordings should be built to support the model, which needs validation \nand refinement by knowledge of specific vocal species. Based on the \nmodel, it is possible to implement the user-independent approach for \nassessing the soundscape resources in LP. \n5.4. Limitations and future studies \nThe set scope and the outcomes of meta-analysis may be the main \nsources of the limitations of this study. For the former, we focused on the \nsoundscape resources only in green spaces, but some natural sounds may \nalso be perceived e.g., roads or urban squares. Besides, our research was \nlimited to peer-reviewed articles that were published in English, which \nmight lead to missed studies. For the latter, significant heterogeneity \nand publication bias were observed among the included studies, which \ncould not be avoided and might have some effects on the results. \nMoreover, the included studies provided relatively small sample sizes \nfor building the reduced effect model. \nBased on the review, we suggest the following three aspects for Table 3 \nProposed indicators for assessing offered and utilized NSES, human inputs required, and potential NSES benefits.  \nOffered NSES (Naturally diverse, \ncharacteristic, meaningful soundscapes) Utilized NSES (Those parts, which \nare actually used/experienced for \nrecreation) Human input (Human factors and \ninfrastructures) NSES benefit (Physiological and psychological \nhealth) \nNatural sound sources  \n- Types of natural sounds within a \ngreenspace  \n- Dominance of natural sounds within a \nsoundscape \nAcoustic features  \n- Sound level/loudness/intensity/ \nsharpness of natural sound sources, which \nenable people have opportunities to \nperceive, identify, or experience natural \nsoundscapes \nSoundscape formal characters  \n- Soundscape naturalness, based on e.g., the \ntype, percentage, or dominance of natural \nsound within a soundscape  \n- Soundscape diversity, reflected by e.g., \ntypes, features, or combination forms \nderived mainly from various natural \nsounds  \n- Soundscape appropriateness, mainly \nreflected by the interactions between \nsoundscapes and contexts, see below for \nthe influential context features \nContextual features affecting soundscape \nquality  \n- Landscape naturalness, e.g., perceived \nland cover naturalness, absence of \ndisturbing elements  \n- Landscape diversity, e.g., land cover \ndiversity, structure diversity, relief \ndiversity  \n- Landscape morphology, e.g., landscape \nfragmentation, continuity and evenness, \nheterogeneity, and density of vegetation, \nroads, or buildings  \n- Species of organisms, including vocal \nanimals and plants, the sounds of which \nare preferred by people  \n- Consistency, e.g., congruency/suitability \nof visual and audio elements  \n- Biodiversity of the environment, e.g., \nspecies richness of songbird and/or \nvegetation  \n- Diurnal variation, e.g., in the daytime, \ndusk, or night  \n- Seasonal difference, e.g., in spring, \nsummer, autumn and winter Experienced natural sounds  \n- Perceived/identified types of \nnatural sounds  \n- Perceived dominance of natural \nsounds within a soundscape \nExperienced soundscape attributes  \n- Perceived loudness/level/ \nintensity of natural sounds  \n- Perceived affective quality of a \nsoundscape, e.g., pleasantness \nand eventfulness  \n- Perceived positiveness of a \nsoundscape, e.g., calmness and \nvibrancy  \n- Perceived overall soundscape \nquality, e.g., acoustic comfort, \nharmony among sound sources, \nor simply good or bad quality \nExperienced context features \naffecting soundscapes  \n- Perceived visual features of a \nlandscape, e.g., percentage/ \npresence of natural \ncomponents, brightness, and \nopenness  \n- Quality of visual landscape, e. \ng., good or bad, and like or \ndislike  \n- Perceived biodiversity, based \non people’s visual and/or \nauditory sensation to recognize \nthe species richness  \n- People’s distance from the areas \nwhere liked or disliked sound \nsources are located Personal factors  \n- Demographic factors, e.g., the nationality, \nlanguage, gender and age  \n- Personal reasons, e.g., numbers of visitors, \nvisitors’ attitudes to nature, visual \nattention, safety concerns, sensitivity/ \nawareness to sounds, visiting frequency \nand motivation, or length of exposure times \nto natural sounds  \n- Human activities for recreation, e.g., \nwalking, biking, hiking in greenspaces and \nexperiencing the natural soundscape \nsimultaneously \nInfrastructures and facilities  \n- Presence of human infrastructures with \nrelevance for recreation and information, e. \ng., the areas for visitors’ pets to stay, \nsignposts marked ‘Enter Quietly’, wetland \npaths enabling tourists to experience \nnatural sounds Physiological health  \n- Stress recovery, usually measured by \nphysiological metrics such as (high- \nfrequency) heart rate variability, skin \nconductance level, and respiration rate \nPsychological health  \n- Soundscape restorativeness, based on \nPerceived Restorativeness Soundscape Scale \n(PRSS) items adapted from Attention \nRestoration Theory components, including \nfascination, being-away-to, being-away \nfrom, compatibility, coherence, and scope  \n- Mood state, based on the measurement \ntaken from the Short Form of The Profile of \nMood States (POMS-SF) representing \ntension, anger, fatigue, depression, esteem- \nrelated affect, vigor, and confusion  Z.

Although some studies have focused on species-specific \nbirdsongs, most do not follow certain criteria in species selec-\ntion. Future studies could, for instance, consider all bird species \nthat may occur in a given season or biotope type, thus enhancing \nthe completeness and validity of the data and making it easier to \nuse in planning practices. By the same token, we also suggest a \nmore in-depth exploration of species-specific differentiation of \nthe preferences for vegetation sounds.  \n(2) More research could focus on the formal characteristics of \nsoundscapes. In contrast to the dominant user-dependent sub-\njectivist approach currently, user-independent formal assess -\nments can more efficiently capture community or collective \npreferences for the soundscape resources (Daniel, 2001 ), and \nprovide place-specific and comparable results for regions and \nareas (Hermes et al., 2018 ), thus supporting decisions regarding \nsoundscape resource conservation or regional tourism develop -\nment. However, this does not mean that only one or the other can \nexist. The two approaches serve different purposes in planning \nand can be combined to obtain the best planning results.  \n(3) More studies could explore the non-monetary and monetary \nvalues of soundscape resources based on ES concepts. At this \nstage, soundscape studies are mostly at the level of individuals ’ \nperceptions, but future research could focus more on the collec -\ntive values or preferences for soundscapes, impact of soundscapes \non human health, well-being, and quality of life, and their in-\nterrelationships. In terms of the monetary value, the attention \nshould not only be paid on how much people were willing to \ninvest in noise reduction (Calleja et al., 2017 ), but could also be \nthe willingness to invest in soundscape resource measures. For \nexample, the survey of people ’s willingness to invest economi -\ncally in the preservation, restoration, and creation of valuable or \nlocally-distinctive soundscapes. \n6.Conclusion \nThis study provides an enhanced point for incorporating the concept \nand evaluation of soundscape resources into LP from the perspective of \nES. As a supplement to ISO12913 documents that consider soundscape \nas the acoustic environment that people perceive instantly, we advocate \nthat soundscape resources can also be an inherent property or capability \npossessed by green spaces. The introduced PSRE framework proposes \nthe concept of NSES and distinguishes different modules, linking the \ndimension of intersubjective and economic values as value bases for \nevaluating differentiated NSES. The PRISMA method was employed to \ncollect qualitative and quantitative empirical evidence based on the \nPSRE framework. We summarized the current challenges in incorpo -\nrating soundscape evaluation into LP, revealed and advanced the state of \nknowledge about people ’s soundscape preferences, and quantified the \nvalue of different natural sound sources for human benefits. Finally, we \npropose a preliminary assessment method for NSES based on the study \nresults, for the soundscape assessment in LP. The results of this study can \nhelp landscape planners to better address people ’s needs for the acoustic \nenvironment, more effectively protect soundscape resources even in the \nabsence of human use, and more comprehensively conduct LAQ as-\nsessments and EIAs. In our next research, we will further deepen the \nconstruction of user-independent models and conduct case studies, and \nobtain actual perception data through immersive experiments to verify \nand calibrate the modelresults. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. \nData availability \nData will be made available on request. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the China Scholarship Council (grant \nnumber: 202108080105) for supporting this research.
