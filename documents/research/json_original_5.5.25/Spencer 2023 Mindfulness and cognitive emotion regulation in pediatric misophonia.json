Misophonia  often begins during childhood or adolescence and is associated \nwith significant impairment and distress in numerous life domains , including  associations with \nelevated internalizing and externalizing disorders (Guzick et al., 2023; Remmert et al., 2022 ), \nreduced  life satisfaction (Rinaldi et al., 2022), and diminished q uality of life ( Jager et al., 2020; \nMöllmann  et al., 2023 ; Williams et al., 2022) . Although literature  on the characterization  of \nmisophonia is growing , research has only just  begun to examine the underlying psychological \nmechanisms  of the condition in adults  (Brout et al., 2018; Cowan et al., 2022) , with \ncorresponding studies  in youth remaining  relatively limite d. A more precise understanding of \npotential misophonia mechanisms during childhood and adolescence could offer valuable  \ninsights into its etiology and prognostic factors. Furthermore, identifying p sychological factors  \nunderpinning misophonia , including attentional, cognitive , and affective processes, is especially \nlikely to aid the development of psychosocial interventions that specifically target candidate \nmechanisms.  \nMindfulness  \n Mindfulness is a construct that may potentially be relevant for understanding  pediatric \nmisophonia, particularly in regard to attentional and cognitive components of the condition . \nWhile conceptualizations of mindfulness are historically diverse  (Chiesa, 2 013), within the \nbehavioral health literature, mindfulness is most frequently  defined as either a phenomenological \nstate, dispositional trait  (i.e., generalized tendency ), or a set of skills to be targeted/instantiated \nJournal Pre-proof"

A trait -based \nconceptualization of mindfulness is commonly used in clinical science research and has been \nshown to be amenable to development of psychometrically sound  self-report measure s of the \nconstruct (Baer, 2019).  \n From this perspective , mindfulness is defined as a multifaceted construct in volving  \nflexible noticing  of present -moment experiences, acting with awareness of one’s current \nbehavior, and embracing a non -reactive and non -judgmental stance to internal and external  \nphenomena  (Baer et al., 2006 , 2008 ). Particularly relevant to the present study, t his definition of \nmindfulness has been adapted for youth in the context of psychometric development of the Child \nand Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM; Greco et al., 2011 ). Here, Greco et al.  concluded \nthat mindfulness may be best conceptualized in youth as a unidimensional construct, due to a \ndata-driven argument  that the multiple facets of mindfulness described ab ove are less distinct  \nand not fully developed  in youth com pared to adults.  \n As mindfulness is predicated on the process of paying attention to one’s environment in a \nparticular way (i.e., nonjudgmental, curious, and flexible ; Kabat -Zinn, 1990 ), the literature on \nattentional processes in misophonia further support the argument  that mindfulness  is a relevant \nprocess in  pediatric misophonia. Conceptual models of misophonia posit that heightened \nsensitivity to particular sounds results in behavior al avoidance of potentially triggering \nsituations, along with hypervigilance and attentional fixation toward triggers (Brout et al., 2018; \nJastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014). Neurophysiological research also indicate s that individuals with \nmisophonia possess a lterations in generalized (i.e., trait -like) attentional processes irrespective  of \nexposure to trigger situations (Frank et al., 2020; Schröder et al., 201 4). Of particular note are \nrecent findings which suggest that individuals with misophonia tend to exh ibit m ore rigid and \nJournal Pre-proof"

While mindfulness has been  specifically discussed in the context of  a case study \narticulating an acceptance - and mindfulnes s-based intervention for an adolescent with \nmisophonia (Schneider & Arch, 2017), to date we are unaware of any research  that examines \ntrait mindfulness and its associations with other constructs relevant to pediatric misophonia  in a \nlarger sample . Such research could be especially helpful for furthering our understanding of \nmisophonia and informing treatment development efforts.  \nEmotion Regulation  \nFrom a behavioral perspective , longstanding patterns of negatively reinforced avoidance \nbehavior s in respons e to misophonia triggers  necessarily mean  that afflicted individuals  are \ndeprived of opportunities to learn  and practice adaptive  strategies for regulating emotions  in \nresponse to such triggers  (Cowan et al., 2022; Frank  & McKay, 20 19). Indeed, recent cross -\nsectional research in adults reveals  that difficulties in emotion regulation  are associated  with \nmisophonia symptom severity (Cassiello -Robbins et al., 2020 ) and intensity of reactions to \nmisophoni a triggers (Guetta et al., 2022). Further evidence of the relevance of emotion \nregulation for understanding  misophonia is provided from uncontrolled case stud y research  \ndescribing psychological treatments for the condition , which often promote  emotion regul ation \nskills  for youth with misophonia  (Dover & McGuire, 2023 ; Lewin et al., 2022; Zarotti et al., \n2022).   \nCertain maladaptive  cognitive  emotion regulation strategies may also directly impact the \ndevelopment and maintenance  of misophonia (e.g., a pattern of hostile attributions such as \nblaming others for making trigger noises could plausibly maintain anger responses).

Cognitive emotion regulation may be especially germane to study in misophonia, as \nreactions to misophonia triggers have been shown to be mediated by higher -order interpretations \nof a particular sound in a given context  (e.g., a family member chewing loudly) , rather than by \nthe acoustical properties of the sound, per se (Neacsiu et al., 202 2)  \nSimilar to the complexities described above related to diverse conceptualizations of \nmindfulness, emotion regulation has been extensively studied using a range of frameworks \n(Braunstein et al., 2017; McRae & Gross, 2020). Consensus seems to have emerge d, however,  \nconcerning the multifaceted nature of emotion regulation  (Gratz & Roemer, 200 4). Despite some \ndevelopmental considerations , emotion regulation – broadly considered – has been similarly \nconceptualized as a multifaceted construct in youth  (Silvers, 2022) .  \nRelevant to the present study , cognitive emotion regulation in youth has been \nconceptualized via the framework of a set of distinct adaptive and maladaptive processes \n(Garnefski et al., 2005). When measured th is way, deficits in cognitive emotion regulation \nstrategies  have demonstrated associations  with greater  psychopathology  (Mayer et al., 2022 ; van \nden Heuvel et al., 2020 ) and decreased  adaptive functioning (Mihalca & Tarnavska, 2013)  in \nyouth . While relatively less studied in pediatric misophonia compared to other conditions, it is \ntenable  that such cognitive emotion regulation def icits are also pervasive in misophonia  and may \ncontribute to impairment in adaptive functioning across numerous life domains (Möllmann et al., \n2023; Williams et al., 2022).  Furthermore, since childhood and adolescence is a critical period \nfor development o f emotion regulation abilities  (Silver, 2022) , and also coincides  with the most \ncommon onset of misophonia (Guzick et al., 2023), emotion regulation represents  an important \nprocess to examine within pediatric misophonia.  \nJournal Pre-proof"

More specifically, mindfulness and \nemotion regulation have been shown to have differential statistical associations with re levant \npsychosocial outcomes, with such relations often manifesting at the facet level for mindfulness \n(Baer et al., 2008; Iani et al., 2019 ; Stevenson et al., 2019 ). In the realm of clinical intervention, \nmindfulness has been conceptualized as an adaptive  process of regulating attention and emotions \n(Chambers et al., 2009 ; Kabat -Zinn, 1990 ), further suggesting  the interrelated nature of these two \nconstructs. However, d ue to challenges in extrapolating findings from the adult literature in these \nareas to ch ildren and adolescents  (e.g., mindfulness defined as a unidimensional construct in \nyouth; Greco et al., 2011) , along with the paucity of research to date concerning  mindfulness and \nemotion regulation in pediatric misophonia, in the  present study we chose  to examine the unique \n(i.e., distinct ) associations between trait mindfulness and cognitive emotion regulation  facets , \nrespectively, and misophoni a. \nCurrent Study  \nThe foregoing literature review reveals  that mindfulness and cognitive emotion regulation \nare worthwhile processes to investigate within the context of pediatric misophonia.

Due to a lack \nof extant literature on the subject,  no formal hypotheses were proffered  regarding the differential \nmagnitude of specific associations among  trait mindfulness , cognitive emotion regulation  facets , \nand misophonia features ; in that regard, these analyses were considered exploratory in nature .  \nSubsequently , we explored whether trait mindfulness  and adaptive cognitive emotion \nregulation  facets moderated the association between misophonia  severity  and diminished \nadaptive functioning  across domains .

More specifically, the interactive effect of trait mindfulness and misophonia \nseverity  on adaptive functioning in peer relationships was such that for participants high in trait \nmindfulness (i.e., 1 SD above the mean), the inverse association between misop honia severity  \nand deficits in adaptive functioning  in peer relationships  was no longer statistically significant  (p \n= .05) . This suggests that mindfulness may serve as a protective, or buffering, factor in pediatric \nmisophonia, such that when mindfulness is bolstered, youth may be better  able to maintain \nadaptive functioning in peer relationships despite the presence of misophonia symptomology . \nGiven that recent research suggests that approximately half of youth with misophonia report that \nthis condition s ignificantly interferes with their social relationships  (Guzick et al., 202 3), this \nfinding highlights the potential critical role of mindfulness in this population .  \nFindings from the present study concerning the moderating effect of mindfulness in \npediatric misophonia are  consistent with the decoupling effect  as a mechanism of change in \nmindfulness , in which  mindfulness has been found to attenuate, or decouple,  the link between \nmental health vulnerability factors and maladaptive behavioral outcomes (Levin et al., 2015). \nThis suggests that mindfulness  represents  a promising technique  for promoting adaptive \nfunctioning in the context of misophonia, where symptoms may be more  intractable, less \namenable to habituation via exposure, and thus complete remission less likely  compared to other \nconditions  (Frank & McKay, 2019).  Specific aspects of mindfulness related to the \nnonjudgmental quality of attention and the ability to flexibly shift/direct attention  (e.g., Kabat -\nZinn , 1990; Masuda & Wilson, 2009)  may be especially applicable to misophonia (Schneider & \nArch, 2017), as hypervigilant, rigid fixation on triggers, along with maladaptive negative \ninterpretations regarding trigger situations have been shown to perpetuate symptomology (Brout \net al., 2018 ; Neacsiu et al., 2022 ). \nJournal Pre-proof"

Despite the frequency of verbal aggression in \nmisophonia, however, the robust  associ ation with self -blame in the present study (rather than \nother -blame) appears to speak to a multifaceted and more internalizing (rather than externalizing) \nnature of misophonia psychopathology (Guzick et al., 2023). While our results  concerning the \nrole of cognitive emotion regulation facets in pediatric misophonia were notably equivocal, the \nlimited findings that did emerge remain  consistent with past research positing difficulties in \nemotion regulation as a key process within misophonia (Cassiello -Robbins,  2020; Guetta et al., \n2022).   \n As mentioned , of all the facets of cognitive emotion regulation examined in the present \nstudy, only self -blame emerged as a reliable statistical predictor of misophonia features \nmeasured by the MAQ ; correlations between cogni tive emotion regulation facets and misophonia \nfeatures also varied widely. Additionally , this self -blame facet did not exert a moderating effect \non any of the relationships between misophonia severity  and impairment in adaptive functioning. \nWhile the design of the present study did not allow us to empirically examine reasons for these \nequivocal findings concerning cognitive emotion regulation, several possible explanations for \nsuch findings emerge that warrant further investigation.

This parallels  many \ncontextual behavioral science -based intervention approaches (e.g., acceptance and commitment \ntherapy; S.C.

These nonsignificant findings  point to \nfuture  research questions, such as why  the moderating effect of mindfulness was only found on \nadaptive functioning in peer relationships, but not family ones or overall life satisfaction. We \nspeculate that  the salient role of family accommodation in perpetuating misophonia \nsymptom ology  in youth (Dover & McGuire, 202 3; Johnson et al., 2013; Storch et al.,  under \nreview ) may contribute to  an underestimation of deficits in adaptive functioning in familial \nrelationships .

More specifically, misophonia \nfeatures were measured using  the A-MISO -S (Schröder et al., 2013) and the MAQ (Johnson, \n2014).  While the correlation of 0.55 bet ween the MAQ and A -MISO -S does suggest some \noverlap, it also raises the possibility that the two measures may be capturing unique features of \nmisophonia – an assertion supported by recent psychometric research on these measures (XXX -\nJournal Pre-proof"

More specifically, e xamination  of items from these questionnaires  \n(i.e., content validity) suggest s that the A -MISO -S captures  misophonia symptom severity and \nimpairment , while  the MAQ  appears to focus more on broader aspects of the impact of \nmisophonia  on a respondent’s life context . Interestingly,  many of the MAQ items focus on the \nemotional impact of misophonia , as well as interference in social domains.  Furthermore, the \naforementioned  psychometric evaluation of the MAQ in youth with misophonia  (XXX -\nMASKED)  found that it includes subscales tapping into pessimism about getting better as well \nas other people not recognizing the impact of the misophonia symptoms . This raises the \npossibility of some conceptual overlap between misophonia impairment measured by the MAQ \nand cognitive emotion regulation facets and domains of adaptive function ing, which may \npartially explain our more robust findings concerning  the MAQ compared to the A -MISO -S. \nAdditionally, t o the extent that mindfulness may also be cons idered a process of adaptive \nemotion regulation (Chambers et al., 2009; Kabat -Zinn, 1990; Linehan, 1993), the relatively \nstronger  correlation between mindfulness measured by the CAMM and MAQ scores compared \nto A-MISO -S ones is not entirely surprising.  \nFinally, the potentially questionable  psychometric properties of the measures of \nmisophonia used in the present study require consideration, as  sub-optimal measurement \nultimately reduces the confidence of inferences drawn from a given study’s results  (Haynes et \nal., 2019). More specifically, the A -MISO -S conceptualizes and measures misophonia from the \nframework of obsessive -compulsive disorder ( Schröder et al., 2013) . However, recent research \nhas begun to cast doubt on the classification status of mis ophonia as an OCRD (McKay et al., \n2018), which  entails  the A -MISO -S may lack content validity.
