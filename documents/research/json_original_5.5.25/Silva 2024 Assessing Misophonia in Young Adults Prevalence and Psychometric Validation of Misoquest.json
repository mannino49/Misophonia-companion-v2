This study investigates the prevalence and psychometric properties of the\nMisoQuest, a tool designed to assess misophonia, in a sample of 549 high school and university students (Mean\nage = 23.2 years, SD = 9.3). The sample included 285 females, 260 males, and four individuals who did not disclose\ntheir gender. Using a predefined cutoff score of 61 on the MisoQuest, 4.5% of the participants were identified as\npositive for misophonia. Psychometric evaluation of the MisoQuest involved both exploratory factor analysis\n(EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA results indicated a dominant single-factor structure, with\nthe first factor explaining the majority of the variance. The scree plot further supported this unidimensional\nmodel. CFA confirmed the single-factor structure, with most items showing factor loadings between 0.36 and 0.58.\nDespite some non-significant factor loadings, the model indicated a substantial relationship between the items and\nthe underlying factor. The high internal consistency of the MisoQuest was demonstrated by a Cronbach’s alpha\ncoefficient of 0.93. These findings are consistent with previous studies on misophonia prevalence and support the\nuse of the MisoQuest as a reliable assessment tool. Given the observed prevalence and the significant impact of\nmisophonia on students’ academic and social lives, early identification and targeted support are essential. This\nstudy contributes to the understanding of misophonia in young adults and underscores the need for further\nresearch and tailored interventions.\nKeywords: misophonia; MisoQuest; prevalence; psychometric properties; young adults factor analysis; internal\nconsistency; mental health\n1. Introduction\nThe term misophonia, derived from the greek μισοφωνία (hatred of sound), was coined in au-\ndiology studies to denote a strong aversion to specific sounds, triggering broad negative emotional\nreactions [ 1–3]. Recently, the Delphi study conducted by an expert panel reached a consensus on the\ndefinition of misophonia, emphasizing its characterization by intense negative emotional reactions\nto specific sounds, which are disproportionate and cause significant distress or impairment [ 4]. The\nmost bothersome sounds typically originate from the mouth and nose, including chewing, crunching,\nlip-smacking, breathing, snoring, and nasal suction. Pen and mouse clicks and keyboard typing\nsounds are also considered misophonic triggers [ 2,3,5]. These sounds evoke neurophysiological and\nbehavioral reactions often misunderstood by peers, friends, and family [ 6,7]. Common responses to\ntrigger sounds include irritation, anger, disgust, annoyance, sadness, physical reactions, and loss of\ncontrol [ 2,6,8]. However, these reactions depend more on psychological profiles, prior experiences,\nand contextual factors than on sound intensity or frequency [ 2,3,5]. Initially, misophonia was confused\nwith other abnormalities, such as phonophobia; however, in most cases, typical fear reactions, such\nas extreme anxiety, are not observed [ 2,6,8,9]. Although the literature reports various reactions, suchDisclaimer/Publisher’s Note: The statements, opinions, and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and \ncontributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

      "text": "2 of 8\nas extreme anxiety, compulsive disorders, depression, and aggression, there is no consensus among\nresearchers regarding their occurrence in patients solely diagnosed with misophonia [6].\nConcerning the manifestations of the disorder, the first symptoms emerge during childhood and\nworsen during adolescence [ 2,8,10]. Emotional instability during this phase often leads to reduced\ntolerance to trigger sounds, causing difficulties such as social withdrawal, learning challenges, and\nfamily conflicts [ 2,11]. While adults show increased tolerance to trigger sounds, the disorder persists\nthroughout life [ 2,12–15]. Moreover, the misophonic spectrum ranges from the subclinical, mild, and\nmoderate forms to the less common severe form [ 6,8,13]. Individuals with mental disorders may\nexhibit misophonia symptoms, suggesting a correlation [ 8,15–17].A study on phenotyping misophonia\nrevealed significant associations with various psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression,\nand obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as medical conditions such as gastrointestinal issues\nand tinnitus [ 18]. However, individuals with these disorders may exhibit misophonia symptoms\nwithout the reverse being true. This indicates that misophonic individuals can be clinically diagnosed\nindependent of comorbidities [8].\nEpidemiological studies on misophonia are scarce and lack sufficient data to estimate its global\noccurrence. It has been suggested that misophonia prevalence in the general population may be\napproximately 3.0% [ 19,20]. Nevertheless, In a study conducted in Ankara, Turkey, Kilic et al. examined\na random sample representative of the general population, consisting of 541 individuals aged 15 and\nolder, and reported a prevalence of 12.8% [ 12]. In a similar study, Vitoratou et al. examined a large,\nrepresentative sample of the UK general population and estimated the prevalence to be 18% [ 16]. In\nGermany, Jakubovski investigated a sample of 2,519 individuals from the general population and\nfound a prevalence rate of 5%. [ 15]. However, specific population studies have reported a high\nprevalence. For instance, a study on medical students in the United Kingdom found that 49.1%\nexhibited clinically significant misophonic symptoms [ 13]. Another study of Turkish high school and\nuniversity students reported that 13.8% had moderate to severe misophonia, and 41.8% had mild\nclinical presentations [ 7]. Zhou et al. investigated 415 university students in Shanghai and observed\nthat 20% of individuals complained of misophonic sounds [ 17]. Similarly, Brennan et al. identified a\nprevalence of misophonia ranging from approximately 8% to 20% in a sample of 1,084 respondents\nfrom a total of 12,131 undergraduate and graduate students aged 18 to 25 [ 21]. As of May 2024, no\nstudies on misophonia prevalence in South American populations exist.\nTherefore, this study aimed to evaluate misophonia prevalence in students from integrated techni-\ncal and higher education levels at a Brazilian federal institute using the MisoQuest questionnaire[ 22].\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Design\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence of misophonia.\n2.2. Participants\nThis study enrolled students from technical and undergraduate programs at the Federal Institute\nof Education, Science, and Technology in Goias, Brazil. The technical courses at the Federal Institute are\noffered in two modalities: integrated with high school education and in the form of Adult and Youth\nEducation (AYE). The first modality comprises young individuals aged between 13 and 18 years, while\nthe second includes adults aged over 18 years. The research team visited students in their respective\nclasses, inviting them to participate in the study. During these visits, students were informed about\nthe research objectives and the procedures for accessing and completing the online questionnaire.\nAdditionally, it was emphasized that minors were required to obtain parental consent through the\nsigning of the Informed Assent Form before accessing the questionnaire. Students with physical,\nintellectual limitations, or known mental disorders were excluded from the study. Undergraduate\nstudents (over 18 years old) from various courses at the Federal Institute were contacted, invited,Preprints.org  (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 11 July 2024                    doi:10.20944/preprints202407.0955.v1"

Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Research Ethics Committee\n(reference number: 5.631.371).\n2.3. Online Assessments\nThe initial page of the form featured an exhaustive task description and researchers’ contact\ndetails. The data gathered encompassed the following information: name, email, gender, and age. The\nMisoQuest was made available to participants during the period between September 15, 2022, and\nAugust 15, 2023.\nThe participants completed the MisoQuest [ 22] questionnaire, a deliberate choice based on\nits distinction as a singular, fully validated misophonia questionnaire. The MisoQuest, a recently\ndeveloped self-report questionnaire, has been demonstrated to possess robust psychometric properties,\nmaking it an ideal tool for assessing the prevalence of misophonia. The instrument exhibits high\ninternal consistency, with Cronbach’s alpha values exceeding 0.90, indicating that its items are reliably\nmeasuring the construct of misophonia. Furthermore, the MisoQuest has shown strong test-retest\nreliability, ensuring stability and consistency of the results over time [ 22]. The MisoQuest is composed\nof 14 items, and each of the 14 items is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, representing varying degrees of\nagreement. The total score is derived by summing the scores for each item, yielding a range of 14-70. A\ntotal score equal to or exceeding 61 signifies a detection of misophonia [ 22]. The establishment of this\ncutoff by Siepsiak et al. [ 22] involved deducting one standard deviation (SD = 4.3) from the mean total\nscore of individuals with misophonia (mean = 65.72). The Brazilian Portuguese version was derived\nfrom the original English version provided by the creators of the MisoQuest [ 22]. Two translations\nwere conducted: one by the authors of the present study and another by a bilingual professional.\nBoth translations were back-translated and compared with the original version.The MisoQuest was\nadministered through online forms.\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using the Python programming language [ 23] in conjunction\nwith Jupyter Notebooks [ 24] for the development and execution of interactive scripts. The statistical\nlibraries used included NumPy [ 25], Pandas [ 26], and SciPy [ 27]. To comprehensively assess the\noccurrence of misophonia among students, we employed a range of statistical tests to analyze the data\nobtained from the MisoQuest.\n2.4.1. Descriptive Statistics\nMean, standard deviation, frequencies, and percentages were used to summarize the responses to\nthe 14 items on the MisoQuest. These statistics offered a foundational understanding of the general\ntrends and patterns within the dataset.\n2.4.2. Internal Consistency Reliability\nThe internal consistency of the MisoQuest was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha. This test en-\nsured that the items on the MisoQuest reliably measured the construct of misophonia, with Cronbach’s\nalpha values exceeding the acceptable threshold of 0.70, indicating high reliability.\n2.4.3. Factor Analysis\nTo validate the construct validity of the MisoQuest, both exploratory and confirmatory factor\nanalyses were performed. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the underlying\nfactor structure, while Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the hypothesized\nstructure. These analyses verified that the MisoQuest accurately measures the intended constructs\nrelated to misophonia.Preprints.org  (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 11 July 2024                    doi:10.20944/preprints202407.0955.v1"

Misophonia Prevalence among Students by MisoQuest\nA total of 549 students (Mean= 23.2 years old, SD= 9.3) were enrolled in our study, comprising 285\nfemales, 260 males, and four individuals who did not disclose their gender. Following the framework\ndescribed by Siepziak et al.[ 22], we assessed misophonia using the MisoQuest tool, with scores ranging\nfrom 14 to 70 and a predefined cutoff value of 61 [ 14,22]. Considering this value, 4.5% of the participants\nwere positive for misophonia.\n3.2. Statistical Analysis and Reliability\nThe psychometric properties of the MisoQuest were evaluated through both exploratory factor\nanalysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess its factor structure, as well as through\nthe calculation of Cronbach’s alpha to determine its internal consistency.\n3.2.1. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)\nAn EFA was conducted to identify the underlying factor structure of the MisoQuest. The eigen-\nvalues obtained were as follows: [7.295, 0.880, 0.829, 0.672, 0.612, 0.531, 0.504, 0.467, 0.424, 0.410, 0.399,\n0.357, 0.325, 0.295]. According to Kaiser’s criterion, only factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 should\nbe retained. As shown in the scree plot Figure 1, there is a clear inflection point after the first factor,\nindicating that the first factor explains the majority of the variance in the data. Therefore, a single-factor\nmodel was deemed appropriate for the MisoQuest.\nFigure 1. Scree Plot of Eigenvalues for the MisoQuest\n3.2.2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)\nTo confirm the single-factor structure identified in the EFA, a CFA was conducted. The standard-\nized factor loadings, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for each item on the single factor (F1)\nare presented in Table 1. The CFA results showed that the majority of the items had factor loadings\nranging from 0.36 to 0.58, with Q1 fixed at 1.00 for scale identification.

Despite some factor loadings not being statistically significant, the overall\nmodel demonstrated a substantial relationship between the items and the underlying factor. Notably,\nthe residual variances for each item were statistically significant (p < 0.05), suggesting a considerable\namount of variance unexplained by the single factor, indicating the potential need for further model\nrefinement or the consideration of additional factors.\nThe internal consistency of the MisoQuest was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, yielding a\ncoefficient of 0.93. This high value indicates excellent reliability, suggesting that the items are highly\ninterrelated and effectively measure the same underlying construct of misophonia.\nComparing these findings with previous research, the prevalence rate of 4.5% is consistent with\nrates reported by other studies using similar tools and cutoff values [ 14,15,28]. This consistency\nunderscores the utility of the MisoQuest as a reliable instrument for identifying misophonia in diverse\npopulations.\nMoreover, the high internal consistency observed aligns with previous findings [ 21,29], further\nvalidating the MisoQuest as a robust measure. However, the significant residual variances highlight\nthe complexity of the misophonia construct, suggesting that a unidimensional model may not capture\nall its nuances. This aligns with suggestions from Naylor et al. (2021) [ 13] and Ay et al. (2024) [ 30],\nadvocating for a more nuanced approach in assessing misophonia’s multifaceted nature.\nFurthermore, Siepsiak et al. (2020) [ 22]demonstrated that early identification and intervention are\ncrucial in managing misophonia symptoms. Providing appropriate support and accommodations in\neducational settings can significantly enhance the quality of life for affected students. Sarigedik and\nGulle (2021) [ 7] also noted the importance of tailored therapeutic approaches to address the unique\ntriggers and reactions associated with misophonia.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, our study contributes to the growing body of literature on misophonia by validating\nthe MisoQuest’s psychometric properties in a high school and undergraduate students sample. The\nfindings support the use of MisoQuest as a reliable tool for identifying misophonia, while also\nhighlighting areas for further refinement in its measurement model. Given the prevalence and impact\nof misophonia among young adults, particularly in academic settings, it is imperative to continue\nresearch in this area to develop effective assessment and intervention strategies. Future research should\nexplore the underlying dimensions of misophonia to enhance our understanding and assessment of\nthis condition, ultimately improving support for those affected.\nAuthor Contributions: \"Conceptualization, Lourival Silva and Matias Noll; methodology, Lourival Silva; software,\nLourival Silva; validation, Lourival Silva, Matias Noll; formal analysis, Matias Noll; investigation, Lourival Silva,\nGabriel Cunha and Alana Barbosa; resources, Matias Noll; data curation, Matias Noll ; writing—original draft\npreparation, Lourival Silva; writing—review and editing, Lourival Silva; visualization, Matias Noll; supervision,\nLourival Silva; project administration, Lourival Silva; funding acquisition, Matias Noll.
