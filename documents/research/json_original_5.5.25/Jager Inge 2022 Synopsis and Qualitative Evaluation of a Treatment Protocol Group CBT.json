It’s characterization as a potential\npsychiatric condition was ﬁrst discussed by the Denys group i n 2013 (2). Research in the last\ntwo decades has been has focused primarily on its phenomenology . The diagnosis has not been\nadded to psychiatric classiﬁcation systems as DSM-V or ICD-11 yet. Misophonia is characterized\nbythesymptomsdescribedin Table1,whichareconsistentwiththesymptomsobservedinagroup\nof 575 patients that allowed the revised diagnostic criteria for misophonia proposed by Jager et\nal. (3). Recently, a Delphi Process study ( 4) led to an agreement of experts on at least 80% of the\nconsensus deﬁnition. This consensus deﬁnition corresponds highly to the Amsterdam UMC 2020\nrevisedcriteria.\nCommon triggers are: eating sounds (e.g., food chewing or sw allowing) and nose—and\nbreathing sounds (e.g., sniﬃng and heavy breathing).

Misophonia\nsymptomsusuallyarisegraduallyinperipuberty,aroundtheag e\nof13(2,3,12).\nResearch on treatment for misophonia started in audiology\nwith the altered intervention of tinnitus retraining thera py\n(TRT) (13).

Cognitive behavioral therapy ha s\nbeeninvestigatedmostoftenandhasshownpromisingresults in\ntreatingmisophoniainsinglecasestudies( 14–18).\nInthisarticlewepresenttheﬁrstprotocolforgroup-cognitiv e\nbehavioral therapy (G-CBT) for misophonia with a systemic\napproach. This is a synopsis of the Dutch manual for group\n(G-)CBT for adults with misophonia developed by van Loon\net al. (19), which contains a protocol for individual therapy\nand a protocol for youth (age 12–18 years) as well. The main\naims of the misophonia protocol are to decrease misophonia\nsymptoms,improvequalityoflife,andtoprovideagreatersens e\nof personal control. The highlights of this protocol have been\nsuccinctly described in the methods section of the randomiz ed\ncontrolledtrial( 20).\nEven though the eﬀect of individual CBT is still under\ninvestigation, the interventions of this manual can be applie d\nin individual treatment as well. Because of the existing evi dence\nfor G-CBT and the signiﬁcant impact of misophonia on\ninterpersonal interactions, group therapy is very suitable f or\nmisophoniapatients.InG-CBTpatientsﬁndrecognitionamong\nthemselves and support for their symptoms.

This case study will serve as a running example\nTABLE 1 | Revised diagnostic criteria for misophonia ( 3).\nAmsterdam UMC 2020 revised criteria for misophonia\nA.

The irritation, anger, disgust and avoidance are not bett er explained by another disorder, such as an Autism Spectrum Condition (e.g., a general\nhypersensitivity or hyper arousal to all sensory stimuli) o r Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (e.g., attention problems with high distractibility in general).throughout this article. We provide a detailed guide to the\ntreatment by describing all interventions and providing tim ing\nand illustrations for the procedures. We review evidence for t he\nprotocol and will discuss advantages, limitations, and possib le\npitfalls by a qualitative evaluation. This article is intende d as a\npractical guide, instead of a discussion of theoretical lear ning\nprinciplesofCBTformisophonia.\nMETHODS\nTheoretical Background\nMisophonia symptoms have been previously conceptualized\nwithin a cognitive-behavioral model ( 21–25). An extensive\nconceptualizationwithintheCBTmodelisprovidedbyVollbeh r\nand ten Broeke (2017) in the Dutch journal of cognitive\nand behavioral therapy, but we refer speciﬁcally to the model\nprovidedbyFrankandMcKay( 26)andthepsychologicalmodel\nintherecentlypublishedarticleofCowanetal.( 27).\nMisophonia can be explained by coupling and subsequent\nmemory consolidation of in themselves neutral stimuli\n(conditioned stimuli, CS) to an aversive emotional stimulu s\nandtheaccompanyingemotion(asaconditionedresponse,CR).\nFor instance, if a child is annoyed by the sounds of his father\neating, but is not allowed to leave the table and has to listen to\nthese sounds, he or she may feel disgusted and afraid to lose\ncontrol. The next meal this child will focus on the eating sou nds\nof father again and the feelings of the last meal will come to\nmind. Gradually the stimulus will robustly and repeatedly evo ke\naversive thoughts or emotions. After this classical conditio ning,\nprinciples of operant conditioning maintain and aggravate\nsymptoms. For instance, if this child fears it cannot inhibit this\nintenseemotionalreactiontotriggersitwillavoidsituat ionssuch\nas dining together, and therefore misses out on important soc ial\nevents.Figure1 shows the CS-CR coupling and the avoidance\nand hyperfocus of the conditioned stimuli commonly seen\ninmisophonia.\nEven though the etiology of misophonia still is unclear, the\nphenomenologyisextensivelyinvestigatedbyourresearchg roup\n(2,3). This research and the resulting revised diagnostic criter ia\nfor misophonia ( Table1) has been the basis of our treatment.\nAll elements of the CBT conceptualization above can be found\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 794343"

Stimulus manipulation and attention train ing\nintervene on the side of the conditioned stimulus.

Almost all patients report a hyper focus ( 3,28).\nThis hyper focus implies that patients are trained to notice\ntrigger sounds much sooner than others. And other triggers\nmay be added if they also are attended to easily. For example,\nwhen the sound of a spouse chewing gum is the trigger for a\nmisophonia patient, this patient will notice this sound made by\nthe spouse before anyone else can notice this. But it is probabl e\nthis patient will then notice a colleague eating gum, and may\nassess if this is just as disturbing. The hyper focus then will l ead\nto a more generalized sensitization. Besides trigger sound s, non-\nauditory triggers (like seeing someone chewing gum) can the ncauseastrongaversiveemotionalreactionaswell.Amisophoni c\nresponsetovisualtriggersiscalled“misokinesia.”\nSinceallmisophoniapatientsreportsoundsasatrigger( 3,4),\nit is safe to say that soundis the primary trigger modality in the\nmisophoniamodel.\nSeveral factors can inﬂuence the development of a hyper\nfocus.Speciﬁc personality traitscanincludeclinicalperfectionism\nwhich has been found in 66–97% of patients ( 3), and the setting\nof high norms, as a trait of obsessive-compulsive personality\ndisorder are found in 26–52% ( 2,3) of patients. These traits\nincrease the chance of developing a hyper focus. Autism like\ntraits have not been associated with misophonia symptoms,\neven though the prevalence of autism spectrum conditions as a\ncomorbid disorder in misophonia is three-fold the prevalence\nas in the normal population ( 3). Last, many of the misophonia\npatientsreporta familyhistory ofmisophonia.\nBesides factors within the patients, external factors such as\nlearning history and environment can also contribute in the\ndevelopment of a hyper focus. The learning history of a patient\nwith misophonia is one in which speciﬁc sounds have been\nassociated with negative experiences by the process of classic al\nconditioningduringlife.Finally, environmentalfactors inﬂuence\nhyperfocusmoredirectly.Whenpatientsexperiencestressora re\ntired they experience more hyper focus than when they are in\ngoodcondition.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 794343"

Patients ar e\nmotivatedtosharetheirmemoriesoftheonsetofthemisophon ia\nsymptoms (to the best of their knowledge) and the eﬀect\nof misophonia on their life and life choices. Experiences are\nshared when patients present their “mood boards” (a personal\ncollage consisting of images, texts, and samples of objects in a\ncomposition), an in-between-session task, with current neg ative\nassociationswithtriggersandtheirdesiredassociations .\nA pretreatment measurement for misophonia symptoms can\nbe performed at the ﬁrst session with the revised Amsterdam\nMisophonia Scale [AMISOS-R; ( 29)].

Therapy sessions last 180min with a\nshort break. The manual has speciﬁc instructions for each\nsession (e.g., with a set time for each intervention and fully\nwritten exercises). CBT consists of four main components:\nstimulus manipulation, counterconditioning, arousal red uction,\nandtask concentration exercises. In the most recent version two\nsmaller elements are added: re-evaluating (eating) norms and\nstress reduction . Matching themes are, respectively, Perception,\nConditioning, Stress, Attention, and Norms. In our center,\nthe practical exercises, like task concentration exercises , are\nguided by psychomotor therapists in an exercise room, but\nthis is not a necessity.

The ambiguit y of\nsoundsconfusesand/orproduceshumor.Thispropertyofsound\nis illustrated by a quiz in which patients have to guess diﬀeren t\n(trigger-) sounds.

Initially, patients learn to reduce\narousal in a normal state, later they learn to relax in a state of\narousal caused by misophonic triggers. Throughout the entir e\ntreatment arousal reduction is a part of the sessions. These\ntechniquesinterveneontheCR.\nStress reduction is based on an intervention for symptom\nreduction from the burn-out protocol ( 36). Patients learn\nthrough self-control techniques [e.g., ( 37)] to recognize\nsymptoms of stress and manage their stress levels by either\ntaking relaxing measures or by reducing (work-)load. Mild\nstress levels require small measures and higher levels requ ire\nmore drastic measures.

Between 2011 and 2021 over 1,200 patients\nreferred from all parts of the Netherlands with misophonia\nwere treated within our psychiatry department. Diﬀerent CBT\ninterventions, among which cognitive therapy, exposure, and\nimagery rescripting, were investigated, but did not show a\npositive eﬀect on the symptoms. Years of trial and error ﬁnally\nresulted in a mix of CBT interventions who were ﬁne-tunedfor treating misophonia in the most eﬀective way. This protocol\nhas been most used in the treatment of misophonia patients in\nclinicalpracticesofar.\nThis G-CBT manual has been used in two clinical trials by\nour research group where it has been eﬃcacious in treating\nmisophoniainDutchadults( 20,39).Theeﬀectivenessoftheﬁrst\nversion of this protocol for group treatment has been examine d\nwithgoodresults( 39).Almosthalfofthe90patientsstudiedhad\nover 30% symptom reduction ( P<0.001) and were clinically\nassessed as “much improved” or “very much improved” on the\nClinicalGlobalImpression-Improvement(CGI-I)( 40).\nThe protocol, with the addition of stress reduction and re-\nevaluating(eating)norms,hasalsobeenstudiedinarandomi zed\ncontrolled trial (RCT) in 54 patients with positive eﬀects which\nwere preserved at 1-year follow-up ( 20). In comparison with a\nwaiting list control group treatment was eﬀective with much t o\nvery much clinical improvement in 37% of the studied patients\n(P<0.001) and a very large standardized eﬀect size (d =1.97).\nIn all completers, on average symptoms were reduced with 28%\naftertreatment( P<0.001)and1yearaftertreatmentsymptoms\nwere reduced with 24% ( P<0.001). Thirty seven percent of the\ncompleters did not meet diagnostic criteria for misophonia any\nmorepost-treatment.\nQualitative Evaluation of the Protocol\nTreatment acceptability was quite high; 65% was (very) satis ﬁed\nand25%wasneutral,andtreatmentwasratedbypatientswitha\nmeanof6.7outof10( 20).\nThe extent to which the various techniques were used and\nthe experienced eﬀectivity of all techniques were systematic ally\nassessedintheRCTbyqualitativequestionnairesposttreatm ent\n(n=42).

      "text": "Jager et al. Systemic Group-CBT Protocol for Misophonia\nFIGURE 6 | Symptoms Charlotte during G-CBT.\nDISCUSSION\nThis paper introduced the protocol for G-CBT for misophonia.\nThe interventions are based on the revised diagnostic crite ria\n(3).TheG-CBTprotocolincludesvariousinterventions:stimu lus\nmanipulation,counterconditioning,arousalandstressred uction,\ntask concentration exercises, and re-evaluating (eating) norms.\nWhile the case study described in this paper responded to\nall interventions and was successfully treated by G-CBT, mo st\npatients beneﬁt from various combinations of the interventi ons.\nMore research to which elements of the treatment have most\neﬀect (on which type of patient) is needed, especially because\nof the lower evaluation and use of two of the main techniques.\nDiﬀerent elements could be compared to each other or patient\ngroups could be matched to speciﬁc interventions. For instanc e\npatients with disgust [64% according to ( 3)] might proﬁt more\nfrom counterconditioning then patients without disgust. Si nce\nmisophonia is an interpersonal problem with a large impact on\nall interactions, group therapy is very suitable. Close relat ives\nareinvolvedthroughoutthetreatment,sopatientsaremotiv ated\nto ﬁght their misophonia together instead of ﬁghting with eac h\notherorﬁghtinginternally.\nThe advantages of group treatment for misophonia consists\nof peer support, more opportunity to practice under guidance,\nmore natural exposure and cost eﬀectiveness. Compared to, for\nexample,thecasestudyofMulleretal.( 18)withadurationof24sessions of 45min of individual therapy (18 therapist-hours pe r\npatient)ourtreatmentisbriefwithadurationofeightsessi onsof\n180minusinglesstimeperpatient(6therapist-hoursperpatient ;\ninagroupofeightpatientswithtwotherapists).\nA ﬁrst limitation of group treatment is the requirement of a\nnumber of misophonia patients. In our experience misophonia\npatients only admit themselves in large numbers to a center\nwhen this facility identiﬁes itself as a misophonia treatment\ncenter. However, the described interventions can all be applie d\nin individual treatment as well. A second limitation is the\nlimited possibility to adjust to individual needs of patients.\nFor example, if a patient has misophonia-related emotionally\ndisturbing memories adding eye movement desensitization an d\nreprocessing(EMDR)therapyasatrauma-focusedapproachmay\nbe considered ( 41). Such an additional intervention can more\neasily be integrated in individual therapy. A third limitati on is\npossiblygeneralizability,sincethisprotocolhasbeeninvest igated\nin especially Dutch patient groups, with a relatively high\npercentageoffemalesandCaucasians( 20,39).\nThe protocol has been used by one other research group\nso far; in a single case study by Roushani and Honarmand\n(42). Three patients were treated individually, but according\nto our protocol, with positive eﬀect. Two of the three patients\nhad a recovery percentage of 42–43% on anger. Further, the\nproposed treatment paradigm for misophonia by Frank and\nMcKay ( 26) is largely based on the present protocol and\nincludes (besides exposure using inhibitory learning): coun ter\nconditioning, stimulus manipulation and stress management i n\n12sessions.Preliminaryresultsofthe18patientsenrolledi ntheir\nRCT have not been published yet. Hopefully this synopsis will\ncontribute to the implementation of (G-)CBT in clinical trial s\nformisophonia.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this article we have presented our treatment protocol for\nsystemic G-CBT for misophonia, which has been evaluated in\ntwo clinical trials and has been used in clinical practice for\ntreating over 1,200 patients. Therefore, this protocol is the\nworldwide most used intervention for misophonia with the\nhighest level of evidence. In this article we have also includ ed a\nqualitativeevaluationoftheprotocol.\nThis protocol is based on the revised diagnostic criteria for\nmisophonia and classical and operant learning principles. All\nelements are described in detail and are illustrated with a c ase\nstudy. It is relatively easy to adjust the group protocol to an\nindividualapproach.KnowledgeoftheprinciplesofCBT,aswell\nasaphasedapproachshouldhelptomaximizeresults.\nWith this treatment manual, we hope to encourage other\ninvestigators for more clinical trials and to inspire clinici ans\nworkingwithmisophoniapatientstoimplement(G-)CBT.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmadeavailablebytheauthors,withoutunduereservation.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 11 June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 794343"
