Bowersa,*, Mercedes G. Woolleya, Karen Mu~nozb, Julie M. Petersena,  \nMichael P. Twohiga\naDepartment of Psychology, Utah State University, 2810 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322, United States of America\nbDepartment of Communicative Disorders and Deaf Education, Utah State University, 1000 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322, United States of America\nARTICLE INFO\nKeywords:\nMisophonia\nAcceptance and commitment therapy\nRandomized controlled trial\nMethodologyABSTRACT\nBackground: Misophonia is a disorder characterized by an intense emotional reaction to specific sounds, often \nleading to significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is \na promising psychotherapy for treating misophonia, but has only been previously tested in case studies. This \npaper presents a protocol for the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the efficacy and feasibility of \nACT supplemented by audiological interventions for misophonia versus progressive relaxation training (PRT).\nMethods: The outlined protocol is a RCT with 60 adults with misophonia. After undergoing a comprehensive \npsychological and audiological evaluation, participants were randomly assigned to ACT (n 30) or PRT (n 30). \nAll participants completed clinician-administered and self-report assessments at baseline, post-intervention, 3- \nmonth follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was misophonia severity and impairment \nmeasured via clinical interview. Secondary outcomes included disgust, anger, sensory sensitivities, well-being, \ndistress, and psychological flexibility.\nDiscussion: This paper outlines the rationale of using ACT supplemented by audiological methods for misophonia \nwith the novel therapeutic target of enhancing psychological flexibility. The results of this randomized controlled \ntrial will help determine if ACT is an efficacious and acceptable treatment for misophonia. This trial will also help \nclarify active psychological mechanisms of misophonia, and assess whether this combination of psychological \nand audiological services can effectively help individuals with misophonia.\nMisophonia is a disorder characterized by an intense emotional re-\naction to specific sounds such as breathing or repetitive tapping, often \nevoking anger, disgust, and anxiety [1]. To cope with misophonia- \nrelated distress, individuals may turn to avoidance, affecting relation -\nships and quality of life [2]. Despite 4.6 % of individuals reporting \nclinical levels of misophonia [3], treatment research is nascent [4].\nDue to the recent recognition of misophonia as a disorder1[1], few \nintervention studies exist. Moreover, the research on misophonia has \nbeen siloed across multiple disciplines, including audiology, neurosci -\nence, occupational therapy, psychiatry, and psychology, with each field \nseeking to characterize and develop treatments for misophonia [4]. Recent findings highlight the unique neurological characteristics of \nmisophonia [5], distinguishing it from other disorders and underscoring \nthe need for specialized treatment approaches. With the research still in \nits infancy, experts advocate for interdisciplinary approaches to advance \ntreatment development for misophonia [1].\nAudiologists were the first to investigate an intervention for miso-\nphonia using tinnitus retraining therapy [6], which aims to desensitize \nindividuals to trigger sounds by pairing them with neutral noise. How-\never, the efficacy of tinnitus retraining therapy for misophonia is un-\ncertain due to lack of controlled trials. Audiologic treatments for \nmisophonia involve making life-style modifications and using noise- \n*Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: emily.bowers@usu.edu (E.M.

[1] suggests that the term “disorder ” more accurately describes misophonia than other terms such as “condition ” or “syndrome ”, as it \nappropriately captures the negative impact of misophonia on individuals' lives.\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\nContemporary Clinical Trials\nu{�~zkw! s{yo|kr o>!ÐÐÐ1ow �o�to~1m{y2w{m k�o2m{zm wtz�~tkw\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2024.107671\nReceived 17 June 2024; Received in revised form 12 August 2024; Accepted 22 August 2024  Contemporary  Clinical  Trials  145 (2024)  107671  \nAvailable  online  29 August  2024  \n1551-7144/©  2024  Elsevier  Inc.

      "text": "cancelling methods to reduce the impact of the sounds. Audiological \ninterventions for misophonia are distinct from psychological treatments \nin that they primarily focus on modifying the auditory stimuli, though \nthey may incorporate traditional behavioral approaches to achieve this \naim. According to one study, individuals with misophonia endorsed \naudiological interventions (e.g., noise cancellation) as being most \npreferred method to manage their symptoms [7]. Still, these individuals \nwere dissatisfied with current treatment options, underscoring the need \nfor more interdisciplinary approaches that emphasize audiologic, psy-\nchological, and neurological perspectives to meet the needs and pref-\nerences of individuals with misophonia.\nResearch on psychological treatments for misophonia has focused on \ncognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), using techniques including atten -\ntional shifting, counterconditioning, and exposure therapy [8–10]. The \nonly randomized controlled trial (RCT) published to date involved 54 \nadults with misophonia, comparing group-based CBT to a waitlist; \nclinical improvement was found in 37 % of participants in the inter-\nvention compared to 0 % in the waitlist [11]. In their review of the \nextant treatment literature, Mattson et al. [4] argued that while CBT \naddresses maladaptive misophonic reactions through cognitive \nmethods, exposure therapy, and emotion regulation, these strategies \nmay be less effective for the intense, immediate reactions to triggers like \nanger and disgust. Moreover, exposure approaches for misophonia have \nbeen called into question given many individuals with misophonia \nperceive exposure to be an inappropriate method to address their \nsymptoms [7]. Instead, interdisciplinary interventions focusing on \nmanaging distress and adaptive approaches may be better suited to \naddress the unique aspects of the disorder [4]. It is evident that more \ncomprehensive and varied treatment studies are necessary to develop \neffective integrated interventions for misophonia.\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a promising psy-\nchological intervention for misophonia, using techniques that provide \nan adaptive framework for engaging with distressing stimuli from a \npresent-centered, non-judgmental perspective [4]. Mindfulness and \nacceptance-based strategies have shown preliminary efficacy in treating \nmisophonia symptoms. In three case studies combining Dialectical \nBehavior Therapy and ACT strategies, individuals with misophonia \nlearned to approach their reactions with openness and acceptance while \nre-engaging in meaningful activities [12–14].\nThe foundation of ACT is built on two core principles. The first is \nfunctional contextualism, which assesses psychological actions by \nconsidering their context and function [15]. This perspective seeks to \nfoster effective behaviors that encourage individuals to engage in \nmeaningful life activities, rather than controlling negative internal ex-\nperiences. In this way, ACT complements audiological interventions by \npromoting behavioral adjustments that help minimize the effects of \nmisophonic triggers, thereby allowing individuals to apply these stra-\ntegies adaptively.\nThe second foundational element of ACT is relational frame theory \n(RFT), a model of language and cognition proposing that humans \ninterpret experiences through learned relationships, not direct experi -\nence. Through an RFT lens, ACT addresses the maladaptive ways in-\ndividuals with misophonia interpret their emotional and physiological \nresponses to triggers. ACT does not aim to reduce misophonia symptoms \ndirectly, but addresses the meanings and contexts individuals associate \nwith these triggers. The goal is to enhance psychological flexibility, \nenabling individuals to stay present and act in line with their values, \neven in the face of challenging thoughts, emotions, or sensations [16]. \nThis focus on psychological flexibility allows individuals to move away \nfrom trying to control or avoid trigger sounds and towards engaging in a \nmeaningful life.\nAs a cognitive-behavioral method that emphasizes process over \nsymptoms, ACT aligns with transdiagnostic, or “process-based, ” thera -\npies. These are gaining interest as potential treatments for misophonia, \nparticularly because they address underlying emotional difficulties and \noverlapping symptoms that occur with psychological comorbidities, a common reality for those with misophonia [17]. Emerging frameworks \nlike the Unified Protocol [18] show promise in trials and case studies \n[9,19]. By transcending traditional diagnostic categories to focus on \npsychological flexibility and integrating adaptive audiologic strategies, \nACT offers a comprehensive approach for those struggling with \nmisophonia.\nThe current paper aims to address the gap in the misophonia liter-\nature by outlining the rationale and methodology of a RCT designed to \ninvestigate the efficacy of ACT, supplemented by audiological strategies. \nComparison of psychological interventions for misophonia to active \ntreatment is rare. This study uses progressive relaxation training (PRT) \nas an active control. Extant CBT interventions for misophonia commonly \ninclude relaxation exercises in order to reduce physiological arousal in \nresponse to trigger sounds. Approximately one third of all case studies, \nopen trials, and RCTs for misophonia include relaxation techniques[ 20]. \nWhile relaxation techniques may be effective in reducing immediate \npsychological responses, they may not address the full breadth of psy-\nchological challenges associated with misophonia such as avoidance and \nsocial difficulties. ACT aims to help individuals manage their emotional \nresponses to trigger sounds in a more adaptive manner long-term.\nBy conducting a trial which evaluates the effects of ACT supple -\nmented by audiological strategies for misophonia, this study seeks to \ndetermine whether targeting psychological processes that promote \npsychological flexibility are effective for the long-term reduction and \nmaintenance of misophonia symptoms relative to PRT. Through inte-\ngrating psychological and audiological approaches, this trial seeks to \nprovide a comprehensive treatment framework for individuals with \nmisophonia. This study will also explore the role of audiological as-\nsessments to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of misophonia \nusing an interdisciplinary approach.\n1.Methods\nThis project is funded by the Misophonia Research Fund. The trial is \nregistered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05601284 ) as well as on the open \nscience framework (OSF; https://osf.io/9mwpd/?view_only f7789c4 \n9dffe4a829cc6e504daac4bdc ) and all procedures have been approved \nby a university Institutional Review Board.\n1.1. Aims & predictions\nThis trial has four objectives. First, we will test the efficacy of ACT \nsupplemented with audiological approaches, compared to PRT, for \ndecreasing misophonia symptoms. We predict that the ACT intervention \nwill be superior to PRT in decreasing clinician-rated misophonia \nsymptoms. Second, we will evaluate the maintenance of treatment ef-\nfects over time. We predict the ACT intervention will be effective at \nimproving misophonia, anger, disgust, sensory sensitivity, quality of \nlife, and distress over the course of treatment and will maintain gains at \nthree- and six-month follow-ups as compared to PRT. Third, we will \nassess mechanisms of therapeutic change in self- and clinician-rated \nmisophonia symptom severity. We predict individuals who complete \nthe ACT intervention will report increased psychological flexibility at \npost-treatment and at three- and six-month follow-ups, compared to \nthose who received PRT. Lastly, we will examine the acceptability of \nACT intervention for misophonia. We predict both ACT and PRT in-\nterventions will have adequate treatment acceptability and credibility.\n1.2. Recruitment & participants\nParticipants were eligible if they were 18 years of age or older, \nseeking treatment for misophonia, and met a clinical cut-off for miso-\nphonia (total score of 20 or higher on the Duke Misophonia Interview \n(DMI; [21]). Psychological comorbidity was allowed, unless it involved \nsevere psychological or neurological impairment (e.g., profound \nneurological impairment, suicidality, mania, or psychosis) exceeding E.M.

      "text": "misophonia as the primary presenting problem.\nRecruitment for the total sample (N 60) was completed within one \nyear from November 2022 to November 2023 (see Fig. 1for enrollment \ntimeline). Initially, we planned to recruit using various methods \nincluding provider referrals, flyers, online postings on relevant websites \nand social media, targeted emails, and newspaper ads. However, an \nunexpectedly high response from Facebook advertisements and paper \nflyers rendered additional recruitment methods unnecessary. Conse -\nquently, we increased our initial sample size from 40 to 60 participants. \nThe final sample included 60 adults with misophonia; the majority self- \nidentified as White (98.3 %), heterosexual (76.7 %), women (70 %) with \nan average age of 33.8 (SD 12.18; see Table 1).\n1.3. Procedures\nParticipants completed an online screening questionnaire which \nincluded study consent, age, interest in participation, and the Miso-\nphonia Questionnaire (MQ; [22]). Participants who met inclusion \ncriteria with elevated MQ severity scores (above 5, indicating at least \nmild impairment) were contacted for an intake appointment (see Fig. 2\nfor participant flow). Next, the independent study evaluator, a graduate \nstudent supervised by a psychologist, administered the DMI [21], the \nDiagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and Obsessive-compulsive and \nRelated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (DIAMOND; [23]), and the Clinical \nGlobal Impression Scale (CGI; [24]). Co-morbid diagnoses were recor -\nded and included in consideration of whether misophonia was the pri-\nmary presenting problem (i.e., the most impairing and/or distressing \ncompared to other psychological symptoms). Eligible participants then \ncompleted a battery of self-report questionnaires (see Measures section).\nFollowing the clinical intake, participants underwent a comprehen -\nsive audiological assessment in the adjacent audiology clinic to rule out \nperipheral hearing deficits and provided a history of audiological \nproblems (e.g., tinnitus, hyperacusis). Audiological tests were adminis -\ntered under the supervision of an audiologist. If participants were \ndetermined eligible following psychological and audiological assess -\nments, they were enrolled and randomized to study condition. Excluded \nparticipants were referred to a more appropriate psychological or \naudiologic treatment option.\nEligible participants were randomized to receive 10 weekly sessions, \nfollowed by 2 biweekly sessions, of ACT or PRT (12 individual sessions \nover 14 weeks). Within one-week post-intervention, participants \ncompleted a self-report survey and clinical interview with a masked \nindependent evaluator using the DMI and CGI. Participants were asked to complete the self-report surveys and clinical interview again at three- \nand six-month follow-up with the same masked evaluator. Participants \nwere instructed to only report their current misophonia symptoms and \nto not disclose any information that may spoil their treatment condition. \nFollowing each follow-up point, the evaluator guessed the participant's \ntreatment and rated their certainty to assess the success of evaluator \nmasking (see [25]). Participants were compensated up to $155 for \ncompleting all study assessments and questionnaires.\n1.3.1. Treatment standardization and fidelity\nStudy therapists included five doctoral students in clinical psychol -\nogy and one psychologist (four cisgender women and two cisgender \nmen). Four therapists administered both intervention conditions, two \ntherapists delivered only ACT during the study. For training purposes, \nall therapists read the intervention manuals prior to beginning the study \nand attended an all-day ACT workshop. The clinical team met weekly \nthroughout the duration of the intervention period to review clinical \ncases and discuss intervention procedures, supervised by the last author \n(M.T.), a psychologist.\nAll assessment and treatment sessions were recorded; 20 % (n 144) \nof sessions were randomly selected for review to assess integrity of \nimplementation and treatment fidelity. Independent raters coded \nselected recordings for adherence to the protocol, quality of interven -\ntion, and therapist competence.\n1.3.1.1. Alternative procedures. Due to the clinic's rural location (e.g., \nsome participants lived over 1.5 hours away), intervention sessions and \nfollow-up assessments were conducted both in-person and via telehealth \non the HIPAA-compliant Zoom videoconferencing platform. In total, \n53.0 % of ACT and 35.3 % of PRT sessions were conducted via Zoom.\n1.4. Intervention\nWe will make the developed treatment manuals available free of cost \non our website (https://utahact.com ) in order to improve access to the \ntreatment.\n1.4.1. ACT and audiological intervention\nThe intervention consisted of 12 individual ACT sessions, supple -\nmented by audiological management, to target misophonia symptoms \nand related outcomes (e.g., functioning and quality of life). Each \nparticipant met with a research therapist for 50 minutes once a week; \ntherapists received weekly supervision from a psychologist and support \nFig. 1.Consistent participant enrollment over 12 months.E.M.

      "text": "from an audiologist as appropriate. Initial sessions provided psycho -\neducation and audiological interventions, while subsequent sessions \nemphasized ACT skills to enhance psychological flexibility when \nencountering trigger sounds and related contexts (see Table 2for sum-\nmary of session content).\nSession 1 introduced the auditory-limbic theory, provided feedback \nfrom the audiological assessment, and discussed information about \nmisophonia and the treatment rationale. Session 2 focused on audio -\nlogical interventions, referred to as functional adaptations, which \ninvolved strategies to modify the environment and reduce the experi -\nence of trigger sounds, without promoting nonfunctional avoidance \nbehaviors. These audiological interventions (e.g., rearranging spaces to \nminimize exposure to specific triggers, playing background music dur-\ning dinner, wearing headphones while commuting), aim to change the \ntrigger sound itself and are similar to techniques in habit reversal training (i.e., if a participant is reasonably able to change or improve \ntheir environment to support coping with symptoms, they should; [26]). \nThe audiological components of the intervention targeted a distinct \nmechanism (e.g., the trigger sound) compared to the consequent ACT \nskills which target psychological flexibility, yet both approaches share a \ncommon goal: to increase functionality of the participant. Session 2 also \nintroduced values, helping the participant connect therapy to what is \nmost meaningful to them. An emphasis was placed on valued action \nduring environmental adaptations (e.g., what is the function behind the \nadaptation —is it to engage in something meaningful or an avoidance \nbehavior?) in order to begin building psychological flexibility. Effective \ncommunication skills based in audiological and psychological theory \nwere also shared.\nSessions 3 and 4 introduced the concept of creative hopelessness, \nexploring how the efforts to control misophonia may have interfered \nwith the participant's life. The therapist and participant collaboratively \nbrainstormed which strategies were effective over the short term and \nlong term, or perhaps were ineffective. Psychological acceptance, also \nreferred to as willingness, was introduced as an alternative approach to \nnatural, though futile, attempts to control or eliminate misophonia \nsymptoms. Behavioral management in session 3 and 4 included check- \nins regarding functional adaptations and strategies for managing \ntrigger sounds (e.g., use of headphones in conjunction with ACT skills).\nSessions 5 and 6 focused on noticing cognitive fusion and practicing \ndefusing from misophonia-related cognitions and self-concepts. Meta -\nphors such as passengers on the bus or the chessboard were utilized in \nsession in addition to experiential exercises. Sessions 7 was dedicated to \ndeveloping present moment awareness and mindfulness skills in order to \nreduce physical reactions to sounds (e.g., clenched jaw) and expand \nawareness of the surrounding environment in the presence of trigger \nsounds (i.e., reduce hyperfocus on trigger sounds). Participants reflected \non how misophonia triggers may pull them away from the present and \nbegan to develop awareness of environmental triggers in order to \nenhance implementation of the behavioral component of treatment.\nSessions 8–10 included values clarification and strategies to enhance \nvalued action (e.g., interpersonal effectiveness skills for managing \nconflict related to noise). These sessions were intentionally designed to \ninclude more flexible content, depending on the participant's needs (i.e., \nif an individual was still experiencing significant cognitive fusion, \ndefusion skills would be revisited). Sessions 8–10 also implemented \nACT-based exposure, where participants practiced willingly experi -\nencing cognitions and emotions that arise from misophonia triggers. If a \nparticipant's misophonia triggers were specific to sounds from people or \nenvironments that could not be replicated in a therapy session, expo-\nsures were aimed at enhancing psychological flexibility with any un-\ncomfortable sensation (e.g., anxiety, disgust).\nSessions 11 and 12 included a review of therapeutic skills learned. \nSession 12 also covered an ACT-based model of relapse prevention \nfocusing on following one's values in the presence of trigger sounds and \nmisophonia-related anger, disgust, and/or distress. These final two \nsessions were scheduled every other week to allow for additional time \nfor the participants to practice their skills. Throughout treatment, ACT \nskills practice (e.g., approaching avoided scenarios, listening to trigger \nnoises) was linked to the participant's goals and values.\n1.4.2. Progressive relaxation training\nPRT consisted of 12 sessions of basic psychoeducation around \nmisophonia and progressive relaxation training (PRT). The sessions of \nPRT followed a similar pattern to the ACT intervention. The first two \nsessions focused on psychoeducation around misophonia and the audi-\ntory system. The remaining 10 sessions integrated psychoeducation \nalongside PRT skills. As based on Bernstein et al.

Audiological measures\nAudiological assessments were conducted using calibrated equip -\nment in a soundproofed booth to ensure accuracy and reliability. \nAudiology testing included: (1) middle ear measures including otoscopy \nvisualize ear canal and tympanic membrane, tympanometry to evaluate \nmiddle ear function, and acoustic reflex thresholds to assess integrity of \nauditory pathway, (2) pure tone audiometry to determine hearing level, \n(3) speech audiometry to measure speech recognitions thresholds, word \nrecognition in quiet, and speech understanding in noise, (4) loudness \ndiscomfort levels to test for hyperacusis, (4) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions. The audiological assessment also incorporated a \nself-report battery of measures assessing hyperacusis symptoms (In-\nventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms Survey; [28]) and tinnitus symptoms \n(Tinnitus and Hearing Survey; [29]\n2.3. Outcome measures\nThe primary outcome measure for this trial was the DMI [21], a \nclinician-rated measure assessing misophonia severity and impairment. \nParticipants also completed the Misophonia Questionnaire [22] to assess \nself-reported misophonia symptom severity. Other primary outcome \nmeasures include the self-report Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale \n[30], Rage Outbursts and Anger Rating Scale [31], and the Adult Sen-\nsory Questionnaire [32]. For secondary outcomes, the Mental Health \nContinuum Short Form [33] measured quality of life, the Valuing \nQuestionnaire [34] assessed progress and obstruction in regard to in-\ndividual values, the Outcome Questionnaire-45 [35] measured general \ndistress, and a self-report and clinician-rated version of the Clinical \nGlobal Impression scale [24] assessed broad improvement. We also \nassessed general anxiety, depression, and stress via the Depression, \nAnxiety, and Stress Scale [36] and OCD symptoms via the Dimensional \nObsessive-Compulsive Scale [37].\n2.4. Process of change measures\nPsychological flexibility was measured with the acceptance and ac-\ntion questionnaire Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-III [38], as well \nas a newly developed measure, the Misophonia AAQ (Miso-AAQ; in \npreparation). The Miso-AAQ was designed to measure psychological \nflexibility in the context of misophonia specifically.\n2.5. Treatment credibility and acceptability\nCredibility was measured after the second intervention session with \nthe credibility/expectancy questionnaire [39]. Acceptability was \nmeasured at post-treatment with a version of the treatment evaluation \ninventory-short form [40].\n2.6. Data analytic plan\nMultilevel models (MLMs) will be used to evaluate between-group \ndifferences in outcomes over time. MLMs are repeated measure re-\ngressions that account for dependent observations (i.e., permits viola-\ntion of assumption of independent data) by modeling specific sources of \ndependencies (random effects) and use all available data for the \ndependent variable of interest in analyses as opposed to listwise dele-\ntion. We will use MLMs to investigate the effect of ACT relative to PRT \nover time (at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-ups) on the \nfollowing outcomes: misophonia symptoms, anger, sensory sensitivity, \nquality of life, general distress, broad improvement, and psychological \nflexibility. We will statistically control for any possible improvements in \ngeneral anxiety, depression, and OCD symptoms in analyses in order to \ncontrol for co-morbidity and related change. We will also consider \nnumber of co-morbid diagnoses each participant has as a possible co-\nvariate, if appropriate.\nTreatment acceptability and credibility will be evaluated using pre- \nestablished cut-off scores. Acceptability will be evaluated as a score of \n21 or higher on the TEI-SF (indicating that ACT was more acceptable \nthan not), a benchmark used in previous intervention research [41]. \nThere are no established cutoffs for the CEQ, but scores of 6 or higher (on \nthe 1–9 scale) will be used to indicate adequate credibility and \nexpectancies.\n3.Discussion\nThe present study describes the procedures and protocol of the first Table 2 \nSummary of session content and processes target in the ACT intervention.\nSession Description Session Content\n1 Psychoeducation and \ntreatment overview1.

      "text": "RCT of ACT for misophonia, offering insights into psychological and \nbehavioral treatment. ACT, rooted in a process-based approach, aims to \nenhance psychological flexibility by promoting acceptance of internal \nexperiences and value-driven behavior. In contrast, PRT focuses on \nrelaxation techniques to alleviate distress associate with trigger sounds. \nThe outcomes of this study will contribute to our understanding of the \ntreatment outcomes and mechanisms of change that underlie misopho -\nnia and related symptoms by following participants over a period of nine \nmonths from baseline to follow-up.\nUtilizing ACT as a process-based approach is critical for addressing \ndiverse psychological and emotional responses to trigger sounds. \nProcess-based therapies, such as the unified protocol, have shown pre-\nliminary efficacy in treating misophonia in pilot trials, suggesting \nprocess-based therapies can address the underlying mechanisms of \nmisophonia beyond symptom suppression [9,19]. Whereas the unified \nprotocol targets emotion regulation, ACT targets psychological flexi-\nbility, and the results of this trial may offer clinicians an empirically \nsupported intervention with a unique target that can help clients engage \nin valued-living while experiencing misophonia.\nMoreover, the integration of psychological and audiological ap-\nproaches lends the trial to create a more comprehensive framework for \nmisophonia. Given the nascent stage of misophonia research and \ndivergent perspectives within different disciplines, this interdisciplinary \napproach is essential. Traditionally, misophonia has been treated pri-\nmarily within either audiological or psychological domains, but seldom \nthrough a combined interdisciplinary lens. Only one previous trial has \nincorporated a brief audiological screening assessing hyperacusis, \nhearing loss, and tinnitus prior to intervention for misophonia [11]. The \ninclusion of extensive audiological assessments alongside ACT allows for \na more nuanced understanding of misophonia, incorporating both the \nauditory processing and emotional responses. The results of this trial \nwill contribute to the process-based literature by examining intervention \neffects in a statistically powered and controlled study design.\nNotably, telehealth became a significant aspect of this trial with \nnearly half of the sessions being conducted on Zoom. Offering a hybrid \nof in-person and virtual sessions improved accessibility and contributed \nto our recruitment success. In response to higher than anticipated \nrecruitment volume, we increased our original sample size from 40 to 60 \nparticipants. Furthermore, study recruitment required fewer resources \nthan anticipated, enabling us to reallocate funds to accommodate \ncompensation for the additional 20 participants. The successful \nrecruitment underscores the feasibility of misophonia intervention \nresearch and interest in treatment among those affected.\nAlthough this study protocol has many strengths, such as an active \ncontrol group and a multidisciplinary approach, there are limitations \nthat provide opportunities for future research. First, the present sample \nlacks diversity, with the majority of participants self-identifying as \nWhite, which may limit the generalizability of findings to more diverse \npopulations. Second, the inclusion criteria allowed individuals with \nvarious comorbid psychological conditions to participate. Although \npsychological comorbidities are common and reflect real-world clinical \nscenarios, there is a possibility the observed treatment effects could be \nconfounded. Future research may benefit from more stringent diagnostic \nexclusion criteria to isolate the impact of the intervention on misopho -\nnia symptoms. Lastly, all clinicians delivering PRT in this study are also \nACT therapists by training, potentially impacting the effects of PRT. \nGiven the emphasis of building awareness of physical internal experi -\nences (e.g., muscle tension and relaxation) in PRT, ACT and PRT share a \nslight overlap through fostering present moment awareness. Future \nstudies may choose to incorporate an alternative active control group \nsuch as psychoeducation to account for intervention similarities.\nIn conclusion, this study outlines the first RCT of ACT for misopho -\nnia, representing one of the few RCTs conducted for misophonia. By \nemphasizing the interdisciplinary approach of psychological and audi-\nological interventions, we outline the comprehensive nature of our study \nand its potential implications for advancing both research and clinical practices for misophonia. The outcomes of this study will enhance our \nunderstanding of misophonia treatment, with the novel treatment target \nof psychological flexibility in this population.\nFinancial disclosures\nThis project was funded by a grant from the Misophonia Research \nFund.
