The  most  common  ones  that  trigger  such\naversive reactions  are  those  elicited  by  the  mouth  (chewing  gum  or  food,  popping  lips)  or  the\nnose (breathing,  snifﬁng,  and  blowing)  or  by  the  ﬁngers  (typing,  kneading  paper ,  clicking  pen,\ndrumming on  the  table).  Previous  articles  have  cited  that  such  individuals  usually  know  at  least\none close  relative  with  similar  symptoms,  suggesting  a  possible  hereditary  component.\nObjective: We  found  and  described  a  family  with  15  members  having  misophonia,  detailing\ntheir common  characteristics  and  the  pattern  of  sounds  that  trigger  such  strong  discomfort.\nMethods: All  15  members  agreed  to  give  us  their  epidemiological  data,  and  12  agreed  to  answer\na speciﬁc  questionnaire  which  investigated  the  symptoms,  speciﬁc  trigger  sounds,  main  feelings\nevoked and  attitudes  adopted  by  each  participant.\nResults: The  15  members  belong  to  three  generations  of  the  family.  Their  age  ranged  from  9\nto 73  years  (mean  38.3  years;  median  41  years)  and  10  were  females.  Analysis  of  the  12  ques-\ntionnaires showed  that  10  subjects  (83.3%)  developed  the  ﬁrst  symptoms  during  childhood  or\nadolescence. The  mean  annoyance  score  on  the  Visual  Analog  Scale  from  0  to  10  was  7.3  (median\n7.5). Individuals  reported  hatred/anger ,  irritability  and  anxiety  in  response  to  sounds,  and\nfaced the situation  asking  to  stop  the  sound,  leaving/avoiding  the  place  and  even  ﬁghting.  The\nself-reported associated symptoms  were  anxiety  (91.3%),  tinnitus  (50%),  obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (41.6%), depression (33.3%),  and  hypersensitivity  to  sounds  (25%).\n/H22845Please  cite  this  article  as:  Sanchez  TG,  Silva  FE.

É  caracterizada por fortes  reac¸ões  negativas  de  ódio,  raiva  ou  medo  quando  os\nindivíduos precisam  enfrentar  alguns  sons  repetitivos  seletivos  e  de  baixa  intensidade.  Os  mais\ncomuns que  desencadeiam  tais  reac¸ões  aversivas  são  aqueles  provocados  pela  boca  (mascar\ngoma ou  mastigar  comida,  estalar  os  lábios)  ou  nariz  (respirando,  cheirando  e  soprando)  ou\npelos dedos  (digitando,  amassando  papel,  clicando  a  caneta,  tamborilando  na  mesa).  Artigos\nanteriores citam que esses  indivíduos  geralmente  conhecem  pelo  menos  um  parente  próximo\ncom sintomas semelhantes, sugerindo  um  possível  componente  hereditário.\nObjetivo: Encontramos e descrevemos uma  família  com  15  membros  com  misofonia,  detalhando\nsuas características comuns e o  padrão  de  sons  que  desencadeiam  um  desconforto  tão  forte.\nMétodo: Todos os 15  membros  concordaram  em  nos  fornecer  seus  dados  epidemiológicos  e  12\nconcordaram em responder a um  questionário  especíﬁco  que  investigou  os  sintomas,  sons  de\ngatilho especíﬁcos, principais sentimentos evocados e atitudes  adotadas  por  cada  participante.\nResultados:  Os 15 membros pertencem a  três  gerac¸ões  da  família.  A  idade  variou  de  9  a  73  anos\n(média de 38,3 anos, mediana de 41  anos)  e  10  eram  mulheres.  A  análise  dos  12  questionários\nmostrou  que 10 indivíduos (83,3%) desenvolveram os  primeiros  sintomas  durante  a  infância  ou\na adolescência.  A  média  do  escore  de  irritac ¸ão  na  Escala  Visual  Analógica  de  0  a  10  foi  de  7,3\n(mediana 7,5).  Os  indivíduos  relataram  sentimentos  de  ódio/raiva,  irritabilidade  e  ansiedade  em\nresposta a  sons,  e  enfrentaram  a  situac ¸ão  pedindo  para  interromper  o  som,  deixando/evitando  o\nlugar e  até  mesmo  discutindo.  Os  sintomas  associados  auto-relatados  foram  ansiedade  (91,3%),\nzumbido (50%),  transtorno  obsessivo-compulsivo  (41,6%),  depressão  (33,3%)  e  hipersensibilidade\naos sons  (25%).\nConclusão: A  alta  incidência  de  misofonia  nessa  distribuic ¸ão  familiar  em  particular  sugere  que\npossa ser  mais  comum  do  que  o  esperado  e  suscita  a  possibilidade  de  haver  uma  etiologia\nhereditária.© 2017  Associac ¸˜ao  Brasileira  de  Otorrinolaringologia  e  Cirurgia  C´ervico-Facial.

Also  known\nas Selective  Sound  Sensitivity  Syndrome  (4S),  it  applies  to\npatients who  have  aversion  to  very  speciﬁc  sounds,  such\nas chewing, breathing,  click  pen,  snapping  lips,  wheezing\netc.1 --- 6These are  usually  low  level,  but  repetitive  sounds,\ncausing the  individuals  a  strong,  sudden,  uncontrolled  and\ndisproportionate emotional reaction.\nThe causes  and  prevalence  of  misophonia  remain\nunknown.3However ,  there  are  online  groups  with  thousands\nof members  in  English,  Spanish  and  Portuguese,  suggesting\nthat it  may  be  bigger  than  established  by  research.\nMisophonia sufferers  are  fully  aware  of  their  abnor-\nmal reactions  to  sounds.3They  avoid  situations  wheresuch  particular  sounds  can  be  produced  and  consequently\nhave the  familial,  social  and  professional  interactions\nseverely limited.3Some  subjects  even  feel  themselves  as\n‘‘ridiculous’’, but  they  cannot  overcome  the  problem  by\nthemselves. Patients  often  recognize  that  present  symptoms\nstarted during childhood/adolescence.7\nMisophonia  has  some  similarities  with  tinnitus,3which  is\nan internal  sound  that  10- - -22%  individuals  perceive  in  the\nears or head.8- - -12Tinnitus  has  been  a  growing  phenomenon\nworldwide, also reaching high prevalence  among  children\nand adolescents,13,14which  is  the  age  range  that  misopho-\nnia is  reported  to  start.  It  is  accepted  that,  if  tinnitus  is\nassociated with  a  negative  connotation,  the  connections\nbetween auditory,  limbic  and  autonomic  systems  increase15\nand cause  further  nuisance,  with  consequent  failure  of  the\nspontaneous habituation  to  sounds.16This  mechanism  can"

She  and  her  family  were\ninvited to  participate  in  a  research  to  describe  their  cases.\nUpon signing  the  written  consent  approved  by  the  Ethical\nCommittee (1458/15),  the  survey  was  conducted  through\na questionnaire  (Fig.  1),  and  the  interviews  were  taken  by\nphone, email  or  skype  due  to  the  long  distance  of  their  cities.\nSuch individuals  indicated  other  family  members  with\nsimilar symptoms, who  were  also  contacted  and  invited  to\nparticipate under the same  conditions.  The  family  was  even-\ntually characterized as presenting 15  members  affected  by\nmisophonia, who were  distributed  in  three  generations  in\nthe family  tree.  Among  them,  12  agreed  to  answer  the  whole\nquestionnaire.\nWe performed  descriptive  statistical  analysis  in  different\nsamples, according  to  the  speciﬁc  focus:  the  epidemiologicaldata  and  the  family  tree  included  all  the  15  subjects,  and\nthe data  about  the  questionnaire  included  the  12  subjects.\nResults\nEpidemiological data\nFig.  2  shows  the  genealogy  of  the  family  members.  The  age\nranged from  9  to  73  years  (mean  38.3  and  median  of  41\nyears), 10  (66.6%)  were  women  and  100%  were  Caucasians.\nThey live  in  3  different  Brazilian  cities:  Natal  (RN),  For-\ntaleza (CE)  and  São  Paulo  (SP).  Regarding  the  education\nlevel, six  are  students,  one  is  trading,  and  eight  had  com-\nplete superior  education  (two  administrators,  two  lawyers,\none engineer ,  one  psychologist,  one  businesswoman  and  one\nuniversity professor).\nQuestionnaire  data:  onset  of  symptoms  and\nevolution\nThe  ﬁrst  symptoms  of  misophonia  started  at  the  age  2- - -33\nyears. By  adding  such  information  to  the  current  age  of  each\nparticipant, the  duration  of  misophonia  corresponded  to  the\ninterval from  7  to  60  years  (mean  =  30  years;  median  =  30.5\nyears) (Fig.  3).\nNone of  them  had  previously  searched  for  treatment.  So,\nthe natural  evolution  over  time  showed  that  7  (58.3%)  sub-\njects feel  that  they  are  worsening,  3  (25%)  are  stable  and  2\n(16.7%) had  spontaneous  improvement."

OCD,\nObsessive Compulsive  Disorder.\nﬁve answered ‘‘sometimes’’, and another ﬁve  answered\n‘‘no’’.\nWe attempted  to  understand  why  such  speciﬁc  set  of\nsounds is powerful enough  to  trigger  such  a  strong  emotional\nreaction while most sounds are  not.  More  than  one  reason\nwas applied for some participants: for 4  (33.3%)  of  them,\nthe  possible explanation relies on  the  fact  that  such  sounds\ndistract  them  in  a  way  that  blow  their  concentration  away;\n3 (25%)  subjects  attribute  the  annoyance  to  the  fact  that\nsuch sounds  seem  impolite,  while  7  (58.3%)  think  that  such\nsounds simply  irritate  them,  without  deﬁning  exactly  why.\nAccording to  the  Visual  Analog  Scale,  the  discomfort  with\nmisophonia varied  from  5  to  10  (mean  =  7.3;  median  =  7.5)\n(Fig.  6).\nAssociated  symptoms\nThe  distribution  of  the  presence/absence  of  associated\nsymptoms reported  by  our  sample  is  seen  in  Fig.  7.\nT reatment attempts\nAll  12  participants  denied  having  ever  sought  treatment  for\nmisophonia.\nDiscussion\nAs far  as  we  know,  there  is  no  report  about  familial\nmisophonia, although  the  issue  has  been  brieﬂy  discussed\npreviously.3,7The  predominance  of  women  with  misophonia\nin this  family  is  in  agreement  with  other  studies.3,17Among\nthe 5  affected  women  who  have  had  children  (numbers  9,11,  13,  20,  22),  4  had  100%  of  their  children  with  misophonia\n(numbers 11,  13,  20,  22).\nRegarding the  age,  both  the  mean  (12.5  years)  and  the\nmedian (12 years)  age  of  our  sample  correspond  to  the  tran-\nsition between childhood  and  adolescence.  Other  studies\npointed to  the  beginning  of  misophonia  in  such  time.3,18This\nwas such  a  dominant  ﬁnding  in  our  sample  that  the  single\nexception involves  the  female  number  9  (Fig.  2).\nOf special  interest  is  the  nine  year-old  boy  (number\n32), the  youngest  member  of  the  family,  who  started  his\nsymptoms at  the  age  of  2,  according  to  the  mother.  When\nanalyzing the  younger  generation  IV  (Fig.  2),  the  doubt  about\nheredity versus environmental inﬂuence  is  easily  evoked:  in\nthis particular  case,  among four people  living  in  the  same\nhouse when  he  was  born,  all  presented  misophonia  (his\nmother and  two  sisters),  except  the  father.\nThe long  duration  of  symptoms  conﬁrms  that  misopho-\nnia is  a  chronic  condition  with  no  tendency  to  spontaneous\nimprovement.\nOne of the  most  intriguing  factors  of  misophonia  is  the\ngreat selectivity involving the  problem,  both  for  sounds\nthat trigger the hassle  as  for  the  people  who  make  the\nsounds. Different from  patients  with  pure  hyperacusis,  usu-\nally pure misophonic subjects  do  not  feel  annoyed  by  loud\nsounds, unless both disorders  coexist  in  the  same  sub-\nject. Misophonic patients have their  strong  and  sudden\nemotional reaction triggered by low level,  but  repetitive\nsounds.\nBased on this, the main  trigger  sounds  were  those  related\nto mouth movements (chewing  gum,  chew  food,  brushing\nteeth, whistling, popping lips), nose (blowing  nose,  snor-\ning, other  people’s  breathing)  or  ﬁngers  (touching  paper\nof candies/popcorn,  typing,  touching  cutlery,  clicking  pen).\nInteresting to  say,  barking  was  commonly  included  in  the  list,\nchallenging the  deﬁnition  of  misophonia  for  those  who  claim\nthat only  human  sounds  evoke  the  disorder.18All  patients\nmentioned at  least  ﬁve  common  sounds  that  evoke  strong\nemotional reactions.\nWe also  investigated  whether  speciﬁc  people  caused\ngreater discomfort  than  other  people  producing  the  same\nsounds. Half  the  participants  indicated  that  their  annoy-\nance with  sounds  is  greater  when  they  are  emitted  by  closely\nrelated people  than  by  unknown.  This  particular  aspect  may\nbe related  to  the  type  of  relationship  that  each  member\nof the  family  adopt  with  people  around  and  with  the  free-\ndom that  participants  may  have  to  express  their  reactions\nof hatred/anger/fear  in  front  of  known/unknown  persons.\nFor the  remaining  six,  the  trouble  does  not  depend  on  those\nwho produce  the  sounds.\nRegarding associated  symptoms,  it  was  clear  that  miso-\nphonia was  either  associated  to  otological/audiological\nsymptoms (tinnitus  and  hyperacusis)  and/or  psychiatric  ones\n(anxiety, depression,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder).  This\nled us to consider  that  such  affected  members  would  bene-\nﬁt to have an  extended  evaluation  composed  of:  (1)  hearing\nexams,  such  as  pure  tone  audiometry,  Loudness  Discomfort\nLevels (LDL),  otoacoustic  emissions  and,  whenever  tinnitus\nis present,  the  tinnitus  pitch  and  loudness  matching;  (2)  psy-\nchiatric and/or  psychological  interventions.  However ,  due  to\nthe long  distance  between  the  three  cities  where  all  the  par-\nticipants live,  it  was  not  possible  to  obtain  such  data.  Due  to\nthe same  reason,  the  presence  of  each  associated  symptom"

This could represent the idea  that  misophonia\nis  an  unknown  problem,  so  people  get  used  to  be  consid-\nered strange,  weird  or  cranky.  A  similar  result  was  previously\ndescribed,3in  which  just  2  out  of  11  patients  have  sought\ntreatment.\nSuch information  could  be  relevant  to  motivate  multi-\ndisciplinary effort  in  order  to  better  manage  this  disorder ,\nincluding otolaryngologists,  audiologists,  pediatricians,  psy-\nchiatrists and psychotherapists.\nIf 15  consanguineous  individuals report annoyance  to\nquite similar sounds, we  wonder  whether misophonia would\nbe  hereditary  or  inﬂuenced  by  the  environment,  or  both.\nSuch numbers  would  favor  the  hypothesis  of  strong  heredi-\ntary component.  Worth  to  know  is  the  spontaneous  written\ncomment on the  questionnaire  of  one  affected  women:  ‘‘this\nhas already become a characteristic  trace  of  the  Andrade\npart of the family.  It  is  interesting  that  it  manifests  even\nin the children who do  not  have  much  contact  with  the\nrest of the family’’. On  the  other  hand,  most  participants\nstarted to strongly react  to  sounds  when  they  were  children\nor teenagers, and this could  have  been  learned  by  living  with\nother affected members of the  family.\nA certain trait which is statistically  linked  to  a  fam-\nily can be non-genetic, that is, transmitted  from  relatives\nto  children through non-genetic pathways, but important\nenough  to create a heredity pattern  quite  almost  infalli-\nble. This  is  particularly  important  for  the  characteristics\nof human  behavior ,  which  can  misrepresent  the  ideas  on\nthe etiology  of  psychopathology,  making  us  believe  that\nthere are  genetic  causes  (and  therefore  organic  determi-\nnants, biochemical  problems,  histological  changes)  where\nthere are  only  problems  in  the  psychological  domain.  Cul-\ntural behavior  is  therefore  inherited  without  being  genetic,\nand misophonia  could  be  a  learned  behavior  in  some\ncases.\nHowever , it  seems  reasonable  that  one  should  consider\nthat the  etiology  of  misophonia  may  include  the  concept  of\na continuum  of  possibilities  between  environmental  causes\nand heredity.  If  we  admit  that  misophonia  in  this  family\nis due  to  genetic  factors,  the  presence  of  the  phenotype\nin three  generations  and  its  transmission  through  affected\nmales and  females  are  strongly  suggestive  of  autosomal\ndominant inheritance.  However ,  the  description  of  similar\nfamilies and  a  systematic  investigation  of  family  history  in\na larger series  of  affected  individuals  would  be  necessary\nto conﬁrm  the  role  of  genetic  factors  in  the  etiology  of\nmisophonia.\nThe incidence and  distribution  of  misophonia  among\nthese family members  led  the  researchers  to  suppose  that\nthe disorder  may  be  more  common  than  expected  and  likely\nto have  autosomal  dominant  inheritance.  Further  research\non familial  misophonia,  including  twins,  are  welcome  to  con-\nﬁrm our  ﬁndings.\nConclusions\nThe  distribution  of  15  family  members  suffering  from  miso-\nphonia and  its  transmission  through  affected  males  andfemales  strongly  suggests  that  this  disorder  may  have  an\nautosomal dominant  inheritance.  Commonly  initiated  during\nchildhood and  adolescence,  the  strong  emotional  reac-\ntions involve hatred  or  anger  to  sounds  and  most  patients\navoid going or  staying  in  places  where  such  sounds  are\npresent.\nConﬂicts  of  interest\nThe  authors  declare  no  conﬂicts  of  interest.\nAcknowledgements\nThe  authors  acknowledge  Prof.  Regina  Célia  Mingroni  Netto,\nAssociate Professor  of  Institute  of  Biosciences,  University  of\nSão Paulo,  for  the  important  insights  regarding  the  heritage\nin the  genealogy  of  the  studied  family.\nReferences\n1.
