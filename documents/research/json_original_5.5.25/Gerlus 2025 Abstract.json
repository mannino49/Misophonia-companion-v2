One promising\nalternative is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex.\nWhile studies have shown that motor cortical TMS can reduce chronic painin human subjects, the underlying antinociceptive mechanisms remain\nelusive, preventing improvement of treatment ef ﬁcacy and duration. Here,\nwe dissected the circuit mechanism underpinning TMS-induced anti-nociception in a mouse model of trigeminal neuropathic pain.\nWeﬁrst developed a mouse-scaled transcranial magnetic stimulation\n(miniTMS) device that we used to focally stimulate motor cortex in micewith a chronic constriction injury of the trigeminal nerve (CCI). Wequanti ﬁed mouse behavioral responses to innocuous and noxious me-\nchanical stimuli before and after TMS. Finally, we used Neuropixels high-\ndensity electrophysiological recordings to identify neural responses to TMSprotocols ( e.g., intermittent theta burst).\nMotor cortical miniTMS induced a dose-dependent decrease in re ﬂexive\nand affective-motivational pain behaviors in CCI mice. Focusing ﬁrst on thestimulation site, we found that layer 5 pyramidal neurons are both acti-\nvated by TMS and required for TMS-induced antinociception. We tracedthe outputs of motor cortical neurons activated during TMS and deter-\nmined they directly project to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), a\nkey node in the descending pain control pathway. RVM intracranialnaloxone injections were suf ﬁcient to prevent TMS analgesia, while\nopiorphin enhanced both the antinociceptive effect and duration. Finally,\nwe recorded neural responses to TMS, determining how pain modulating\nneurons are affected.Together, these data elucidate the mechanism of TMS-induced analgesia\nby revealing that motor cortical TMS utilizes endogenous opioid signaling\nin medullary descending pain control pathways to produce anti-nociception. This novel knowledge paves the way to improving existing\nand designing novel TMS protocols.\nResearch Category and Technology and MethodsBasic Research: 10.

Duke University, USA\nAbstract\nMisophonia is a debilitating disorder marked by reduced tolerance totrigger sounds and associated stimuli. We have shown that high-frequency\n(HF) rTMS reduces distress associated with trigger sounds and enhances\ncognitive regulation of distress. During exposure to trigger sounds, pre-vious studies of misophonia have shown involvement of the insula, a brain\nregion that integrates cognitive, affective, and sensory processing. There-\nfore, understanding how insula functional connectivity (FC) in individualswith misophonia differs from that of clinical controls may lead to opti-\nmized targeting for rTMS interventions to treat misophonia.\nIn a blinded clinical trial, 30 clinical controls and 29 adults with miso-phonia completed a task paradigm in a 3T MRI scanner; they heardpersonalized misophonic, aversive, and neutral sounds and were asked to\neither listen to sounds or downregulate associated emotions. Generalized\npsychological-physiological interaction models were implemented in FSLand used the left insula as a seed to examine its FC changes during regu-\nlating versus listening to sounds.\nCompared to hearing misophonic sounds, regulation of misophonia-drivenemotions led to signi ﬁcantly higher left insula FC with the left mid-\ncingulate cortex in the misophonia group vs. controls (z\nmax_cluster ¼3.69, p\n¼.0241). Furthermore, adults with misophonia versus controls showed\nsigniﬁcantly lower FC between left insula and right superior temporal\nsulcus when hearing misophonic versus aversive sounds (z max_cluster\n¼3.53, p ¼.022). When regulating versus hearing non-misophonic aversive\nsounds, adults with misophonia showed higher insula FC with the rightsupplementary motor area (z\nmax_cluster ¼4.35, p ¼.001) and the right\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex (z max_cluster ¼4.23-4.29, p <.002).\nIndividuals with misophonia show greater left insula engagement ofcognitive control regions during regulation of non-misophonic but not\nmisophonic sounds. Group differences in insula FC during sound reactivity\nand regulation suggest that insula circuitry may be a promising target forfuture HF-rTMS misophonia interventions.Research Category and Technology and Methods\nTranslational Research: 18.
