However, for a\ngroup of people these sounds are not only distracting but alsoevoke a strong feeling of anger accompanied by an urge toescape from the situation producing these sounds. This condi-tion, marked by sensitivity to a selective group of sounds, wasgiven the name “misophonia ”(hatred of sounds) almost a\ndecade ago. Since the sounds that act as “triggers” in this condi-\ntion are quite common at home, work place and in social gath-erings, misophonia has devastating effects on social, family andpersonal life of the sufferer. Presently misophonia is not fea-tured in any of ﬁcial medical/psychiatric classi ﬁcations. People\nwith misophonia suffer in silence because they do not sharetheir problem with others for the fear of being called “crazy ”.\nThe objective of the current work was to check the consistencyof pro ﬁle of symptoms and trigger sounds in a population of\nsubjects with misophonia.Method A group of subjects were assessed by a group of neu-\nrologists in a neurology clinic. T o further assess the symptoms/triggers in a bigger population, a questionnaire was designed\nasking questions about symptoms/triggers etc which was then\nposted on a website dedicated to disseminate information aboutmisophonia. People were requested to ﬁll-in the questionnaire\nand send back by email.Results The assessment in the neurology clinic con ﬁrmed a\nstriking similar pro ﬁle of symptoms and triggers in the indivi-\nduals. A group of 195 subjects ﬁlled-in the questionnaire posted\non the website. Analysis of 157 questionnaire showed:\nMean Age of Onset =12.08 years [5 –50]\n146/157 (93.0%) describe eating sounds as triggers135/157 (86.0%) describe anger as the dominant emotion\n(other emotions include panic/anxiety)\n132/157 (84.0%) describe leaving the situation which\nproduce trigger sounds.Conclusion Our data indicate that misophonia is a disorder of\nemotion processing of sounds which need to be investigatedfurther.\nJ Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2014; 85:e3 15 of 16BNA Abstracts"
