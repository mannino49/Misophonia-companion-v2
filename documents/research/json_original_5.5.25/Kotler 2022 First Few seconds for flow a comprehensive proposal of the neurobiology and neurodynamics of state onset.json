Phenom -\nenologically, flow is accompanied by a loss of self-consciousness, seamless integration of action and awareness, \nand acute changes in time perception. Research has begun to uncover some of the neurophysiological correlates \nof flow, as well as some of the state ’s neuromodulatory processes. We comprehensively review this work and \nconsider the neurodynamics of the onset of the state, considering large-scale brain networks, as well as dopa-\nminergic, noradrenergic, and endocannabinoid systems. To accomplish this, we outline an evidence-based hy-\npothetical situation, and consider the flow state in a broader context including other profound alterations in \nconsciousness, such as the psychedelic state and the state of traumatic stress that can induce PTSD. We present a \nbroad theoretical framework which may motivate future testable hypotheses.   \n1.Introduction \nFlow is an altered state of consciousness that is thought to occur \nwhen we are fully engaged in a relatively challenging task or activity \nthat is matched to our skills. The phenomenon has been scientifically \ninvestigated for nearly fifty years, after first being elucidated by Mihaly \nCsikszentmihalyi in the 1970 s (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975 ), who studied \nthe state from a psychological framework (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ). \nWhile researchers built upon this framework for nearly five decades, \ninvestigations into the state ’s underlying neurophysiology are relatively \nrecent. Yet, it is known that flow is associated with specific alterations in \nbrain activity, including changes in neural oscillation, \nneuro-modulatory processes, dynamic activations of specific brain re-\ngions, as well as alterations in large-scale brain connectivity. \nAdditionally, both cognitively and neurobiologically, the state of \nflow shares overlap with other altered states of consciousness, including \nmeditative and psychedelic states, states of traumatic stress, and so- \ncalled peak or optimal experiences (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2014; Brandmeyer et al., 2019; Wheeler and Dyer, 2020 ). While scientists have \nexplored some of the neurobiological changes beneath the aforemen -\ntioned altered states (Brewer et al., 2011; Nash et al., 2018; Yanes and \nLoprinzi, 2018 ), the precise neural mechanisms underpinning the onset \nof flow and the state itself remain unclear, both empirically and theo-\nretically. In addition, a comprehensive theoretical account of flow ’s \nneural dynamics is missing from the literature, yet exists for other \naltered states (Preller et al., 2019; Girn et al., 2017; Travis, 2020 ). Thus, \nthe current research leaves open many questions: How does the brain \ntransition into a flow state? What is the temporal nature of this transi -\ntion, including how long do the changes that facilitate state onset last, \nand what neural dynamical processes mark the transition into the state \nitself? From a neuroscientific perspective, how is flow distinct from, or \nsimilar to, other altered states of consciousness? \nIn order to answer the aforementioned questions, we compare and \ncontrast the neurobiological mechanisms for flow with other profound \nalterations in consciousness, including both psychedelic states and the \ntraumatic stress that can produce Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n*Corresponding author at: Cognitive Communication Science Lab, Department of Communication, University of California Davis, United States. \nE-mail address: rwhuskey@ucdavis.edu (R.

We argue that this comparative approach is helpful when \nconsidering factors such as mood states, fear inhibition, emotional \narousal, hyper-vigilance, and contextual cue processing. We propose a \ncomprehensive empirical and theoretical account of the onset of flow. \nThis account includes a number of clear and measurable brain signals \nthat precede the onset of the state, and suggests that there is a large-scale \nbrain network associated with flow. \nThe goals of this paper are five-fold: First, we review current research \non flow, laying the groundwork for a rigorous exploration of the flow’s \nneurobiology, including establishing the criteria that any viable expla -\nnation of flow’s neural dynamics should meet. The purpose of this paper \nis to comprehensively draw upon the relevant literature in order to \nrigorously propose and justify a novel framework for the onset of flow, \nas well as establish an agenda for future flow research. Second, we \noutline a conceptual scenario where two fundamental outcomes can \noccur: the onset of flow, or the onset of traumatic stress that may lead to \nPTSD. Third, we propose a neural mechanism for the onset of flow that \ninvolves selected activation of a large-scale network and a set of brain \nregions with specific patterns of networked communication. Fourth, by \ndrawing upon recent studies of the neural dynamics of the psychedelic \nstate, we construct a proposal for the brain dynamics of flow, and further \nsuggest that this proposal may yield a computational modeling \napproach. Fifth, given our comprehensive account of a possible flow \nnetwork and its dynamics, we link flow’s neurobiology with its phe-\nnomenology, then compare those dynamics with both trauma, and the \npsychedelic state. In doing so, we lay a foundation for generating new, \ntestable hypotheses that can add to the empirical literature on the \nneurobiology of flow. \nFinally, given the complexity of the brain and the contextual inter-\naction between the body and environment during flow, a comprehensive \nexplanation of the neurobiology of flow onset must incorporate concepts \nfrom a number of neuroscientific domains, explained at multiple levels \n(Huskey et al., 2020). These include behavioral, theoretical, molecular \nand systems neuroscience. Thus, our proposal offers a first accounting of \nrelevant mechanisms involved in flow: neurotransmitter systems, neural \noscillation, and large-scale functional connectivity, and links each with \nthe phenological characteristics of flow. \n2.An overview of flow research \nThe formal study of flow began in the 1970 s, with Mihaly Csiks -\nzentmihalyi’s systematic investigations. Csikszentmihalyi defined flow \nas “an optimal state of consciousness where we feel our best and perform \nour best” and discovered that flow is a universal phenomenon in \nhumans, arising globally, independent of task, and regardless of class, \nculture, or creed (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). \nAdditionally, Csikszentmihalyi identified six phenomenological \ncharacteristics that are commonly present during flow: Hyper-focused, \ntask-specific attention; the merger of action-and-awareness leading to \ntotal absorption in task-engagement; the diminishment of self-reflective \ncognition and awareness of bodily processes; an altered perception of \ntime; a heightened level of task-performance accompanied by a feeling \nof complete control; and significant positive affect, including high levels \nof intrinsic reward, enjoyment, pleasure, euphoria and, often, increased \nfeelings of meaning and purpose. Psychometrically, these six charac -\nteristics have become the way researchers both define and measure flow. \nWhether these characteristics are necessary as well as sufficient condi -\ntions for the experience of flow remains an open question. In fact, to our \nknowledge, no research into the neurobiological mechanisms involved \nin flow have confirmed the presence of all six characteristics. What has \nbeen shown is that the intensity of each characteristic helps researchers \ndetermine where an experience sits on the spectrum between micro- \nflow, a low intensity flow experience, or macro-flow, a high intensity \nflow experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; Csikszentmihalyi and Naka -\nmura, 2002; Engeser, 2012). While this research is based on \nself-reported subjective assessments, it appears to be largely consistent as a categorization of the “spectrum” of flow experiences. \nMore broadly, flow is an altered state of consciousness (Dietrich, \n2004; Csikszentmihalyi and Nakamura, 2014; Lee et al., 2016). Altered \nstates of consciousness (Wittmann, 2018) are characterized as signifi -\ncant deviations from normal waking states of consciousness. For \ninstance, flow has been shown to be associated with phenomena found \nin other altered states, including disassociation, the feeling of oneness \nwith everything, and out-of-body experiences (for disassociation, \nWanner et al., 2006; for oneness, see: Newberg et al., 2001; Tsaur et al., \n2013; Yaden et al., 2017; Kotler, 2006, 2013; for out of body experi -\nences, see: Kotler, 2006). \nSeveral excellent recent systematic and scoping reviews have been \npublished on flow, which address psychology, physiology, and neuro -\nbiology, for both individual as well as group flow, including van der \nLinden et al. (2021), Knierim et al. (2018), Khoshnoud et al. (2020), \nKryston et al. (2018), Fisher et al. (2021), Weber et al., (2016, 2020), \nGold and Ciorciari, 2020; Pels et al., 2018, and Peifer et al. (2022). Our \nreview and proposal draws on this existing work and extends it in two novel \nways. First, we elucidate the underlying neural dynamics of flow, in \nterms of network and coordination dynamics, something which has not \nbeen previously discussed. And second, also for the first time, we discuss \nthe neural dynamics of flow in the context of the dynamics of trauma, \nand the psychedelic state. \nAny viable explanation of flow’s underlying neurobiology needs to \nsatisfy several criteria. First, it must account for the altered state of \nconsciousness that characterizes flow. Second, it must link flow’s \nphenomenological characteristics with neurobiological processes. \nFinally, any viable explanation of flow’s underlying neurobiology and \nneural dynamics must consider both prior research and satisfy an \nadditional number of explanatory requirements, including flow’s widely \ndocumented impact on performance and the currently theorized “flow \ntriggers,” the pre-conditions that have been proposed to produce, or at \nvery least, be correlated with, flow. Although the literature on flow is \nbecoming extensive, the neurobiology underlying the concept and its \nantecedent causes, much like hypnosis (Landry et al., 2017), are not yet \nfully explained. Flow neuroscience faces many of the same challenges \nthat face the general scientific study of consciousness, creating a unified \nobjective theory of subjective experience (Seth and Bayne, 2022). \nNevertheless, the fact that flow and its well-documented effects can be \nsuccessfully investigated from a psychological and phenomenological \nperspective (Melnikoff et al., 2022) suggests an optimistic outlook for \nthe neurobiological elucidation of flow. In what follows, we briefly \noutline currently theorized flow triggers, their possible causal role, and \nthe resulting performance enhancements associated with flow. \n2.1. The Functionality of Flow’s Triggers \nPrevious theorizing argues that several “triggers” are causally linked \nwith individual and group flow (Sawyer, 2017; Csikszentmihalyi and \nNakamura, 2002; and for a full overview, see Kotler, 2021). As this \npaper concerns individual flow, it is only the individual flow triggers \nthat are discussed herein. These triggers include: (a) clear goals, im-\nmediate feedback and the challenge/skills balance where both the task’s \nchallenge and an individual’s skills are high (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; \nCsikszentmihalyi and LeFevre, 1989, 2012; Nakamura and Csikszent -\nmihalyi, 2005), (b) novelty, complexity, unpredictability, and insight \n(Kotler, 2006, 2021; Teng, 2011), (c) risk (Martin and Priest, 1986; \nCelsi, 1993; Kotler, 2013; Schüler and Nakamura, 2013), (d) deep \nembodiment or the hyper-awareness of cross sensory modalities \n(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Chavez, 2008; Jaque et al., 2020), major \nintrinsic motivators such as curiosity, autonomy, passion, purpose and \nmastery (Bakker and Geurts, 2004; Quinn, 2005; Salanova et al., 2006; \nKotler, 2021). Additionally, while this idea remains speculative, some \nresearchers have argued that flow triggers operate via independent yet \noften overlapping mechanisms that govern the allocation of attention to \nthe task-at-hand: the activation of dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic S.

A hypothetical situation: flow versus PTSD \nIn order to examine the neurobiological processes that may occur \nduring the onset of flow, consider the following hypothetical situation: A \nhighly skilled motorcycle rider is speeding down the freeway and sud-\ndenly gets cut off by a car (the “event ”). While other mental states are \npossible (mind-wandering, for example), assume that pre-event, the \nmotorcyclist is actively engaged in the task of driving down the freeway, \nwith concurrent increases in focus and alertness. Next, to avoid collision, \nthe motorcyclist has an immediate response, swerving around the \noffending car. Now consider two possible and frequently reported out-\ncomes of high-risk situations, each with their own distinct yet over-\nlapping psychological characteristics. \nIn one possible outcome, the motorcycle rider starts to swerve, \nrapidly transitions into flow and skillfully avoids the car. The motor -\ncyclist draws upon prior experience and skills and performs a series of \nperfectly timed motor actions with a high level of task proficiency. More \nspecifically, the situation elicits the flow ’s theorized triggers and should \nbe associated with psychological characteristics that are present during \nthe experience, including complete concentration on the task-at-hand, \nthe merger of action and awareness, an altered sense of time (dilation \nor acceleration), a diminishment in sense of self, a heightened sense of \ncontrol over the situation, and a post-event increase in positive affect \nand mood. \nAlternatively, the motorcycle rider starts to swerve, feels a sense of \noverwhelm and panic, yet manages to maneuver around the car and \navoid an accident. In this case, the motorcyclist is likely to experience \ntraumatic stress, including heightened anxiety, feelings of terror and \npowerlessness, and a post-event increase in negative affect, hyper- \nvigilance and the distinct possibility of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD). In order to motivate a discussion concerning the transition into \na flow state, we emphasize that, in this situation and before the event \ntakes place, the driver is not yet in flow; rather in a state of appropriate \narousal and alertness (and valence). The transition into flow may occur \nwhen an event takes place that could potentially lead to flow —that is, an \nevent with a confluence of flow triggers. \nWhile these scenarios are not the event ’s only possible psychological \noutcomes, both are frequently reported phenomena in high-risk situa-\ntions, including those found in adventure activities, sports and combat \n(for flow, see: Allen-Collinson et al., 2018; Jackson, 1992 , for trauma, \nsee: Ozer et al., 2003; Van der Kolk and Van der Hart, 1989) . We also \nnote that the comparison between flow and the precursors of PTSD in \nthis hypothetical situation may generalize most readily to high-risk \nsituations. Admittedly, not all flow experiences are high-risk (e.g., aca-\ndemic achievement, work productivity, media use, artistry, mental \nhealth). Nevertheless, we emphasize that this particular hypothetical \nsituation is useful in that it allows for a broader theoretical investigation \nconcerning flow experiences and an opportunity to consider their rela-\ntion to PTSD and the psychedelic state. Moreover, we expect the same \nsequence of neurobiological events should result in flow for both high- \nand low-risk circumstances. Therefore, we pose this hypothetical situ-\nation to underscore a crucial question: What precise alterations in brain \nfunction and neural dynamics distinguish these two outcomes, either the \ntransition into flow or the transition into traumatic stress? \nConsider that, neurobiologically, the pre-flow/pre-trauma initial \nconditions are identical. The motorcyclist is experiencing heightened \nfocus and alertness, reflecting increased activity in large scale brain \nnetworks, including executive attention, salience, motor action planning \nand execution. Next, as the “event ” begins, the motorcyclist is cut off by \nthe car. Neurobiologically, this produces an immediate increase in ac-\ntivity in the brain ’s salience network (SN), which is charged with the \ndetection of novel and relevant stimuli (Menon and Uddin, 2010; Weber and Fisher, 2020 ). Whether the motorcyclist ’s experience becomes \necstatic (flow) or traumatic is likely to depend on what happens next. If \nthe experience is overwhelming, terrifying, or there are physical or \nmental constraints that inhibit the execution of action plans, then the \nswerve is likely to result in traumatic stress. However, if flow ’s triggers \nare present, then we theorize that this should result in a sequence of \nneural responses that elicit flow, and the corresponding psychological, \nphenomenological, and behavioral responses. \nThis emphasis on “action ” is particularly important to our discussion. \nIn the literature surrounding both flow and PTSD, action or the inability \nto act consistently plays a crucial role. “Flow is triggered during a task, \nthereby implying motor execution ” (Michailidis et al., 2018 ). Addi-\ntionally, in flow, this action has two phenomenological qualities: \neffortlessness and empowerment. Effortlessness implies automatic pro-\ncessing (Dietrich and Stoll, 2010 ), while empowerment refers to one of \nthe flow ’s core psychological characteristics: a “sense of control. ” \nMoreover, the “inability to act” is one of the causal factors involved in \nPTSD (Van der Kolk and Van der Hart, 1989 ) and learned helplessness \n(Miller and Norman, 1979; Seligman, 1972 ). This suggests that the \nheightened sense of control in flow may be the opposite of learned \nhelplessness or what could be termed “learned powerfulness, ” and \nconsidered as a possible pre-condition for resiliency and post-traumatic \ngrowth, a term coined by Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004) to describe \n“positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle \nwith highly challenging life circumstances ”. \nSimilarly, researchers have found that many of flow ’s performance \nbenefits, including increases in well-being, meaning, empathy, motiva -\ntion, grit, and environmental awareness are also characteristic of post- \ntraumatic growth (Jayawickreme et al., 2022; Maitlis, 2020; Tedeschi \nand Calhoun, 2004; Waters et al., 2022 ). This overlap in performance \nbenefits suggests that flow and post-traumatic growth may share un-\nderlying neurobiological mechanisms , an idea that aligns with Selye ’s \n(1956) division between eustress (beneficial stress) and distress \n(harmful stress) and lends additional support to our comparison of flow \nand trauma (for linkages between flow and eustress, see Hargrove et al., \n2013 ). \nAs a way to explore these changes, we examine the event temporally, \nbreaking the incident into nine “sequence-coded ” sections —starting \nwith T 0, the moment before the rider is cut off in traffic, and pro-\nceeding to T 9, the post-event moment when the rider drives down the \nfreeway in either flow or traumatic stress —and detail the precise \nneurobiological changes that underpin each step in the sequence. This \nframework both allows us to see when, where and why the experiences \nof flow and trauma overlap then diverge, while further serving to \nelucidate flow ’s phenomenology, its performance benefits and the \nfunctionality of known flow triggers. \n2.3. T 0: Pre-Flow Events \nThe specific neurobiological pre-conditions that elicit flow comprise \na vast state space. Nevertheless, people get into flow doing all sorts of \ntasks, suggesting that the exact details of pre-event neurobiology are less \nimportant than the increase in salience that marks the onset of the event. \nTherefore, we maintain our motorcycle hypothetical situation. At the \nstart of the event, our motorcyclist is speeding down the freeway in a \nstate of alert focus. Neurobiologically, the executive attention network \n(EAN) is engaged, as this network has been shown to facilitate attention \nwhile driving (Ball et al., 1993; Clay et al., 2005 ), including when \ndrivers experience a sudden road hazard then drive away safely, which \naccurately describes our hypothetical situation (Åkerstedt et al., 2005 ). \nAt T 0, an “unexpected stimulus ” arrives, requiring amplification \nin SN connectivity (Seeley et al., 2007 , Menon and Uddin, 2010 ; Srid-\nharan et al., 2008 ). This is significant because the SN has been theorized \nto be involved in facilitating shifts into flow (Huskey et al., 2018, 2021 ; \nWeber and Fisher, 2020 ). Moreover, the SN is involved in the initiation \nof cognitive control (Botvinick et al., 2004 ), the coordination of S. Kotler et al."

Once that unexpected stimulus is detected, the key SN regions \nthat are active in both our flow and trauma scenarios likely include the \ndorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), the anterior right insula (aRI), \nthe presupplementary motor area (PSA), amygdala, ventral striatum and \nventral tegmental area (VTA). \nThe dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is an important cognitive \ncontrol structure (Holroyd et al., 2004 ) and is likely involved in \ndetecting the unexpected stimulus (the car), as the dACC is associated \nwith conflict detection and error identification (Carter and Van Veen, \n2007 ; for review: Falkenstein et al., 2000) . In conflict detection, the ACC \nmonitors attentional conflicts to signal whenever additional resources \nare required. In predictive-coding, a series of reciprocal connections \nbetween the ACC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are involved \nin the prediction and processing of error messages (Alexander and \nBrown, 2019 ). In addition, the aRI may be involved, as this region is also \nactive during performance monitoring and error processing (Ullsperger \net al., 2010 ). In this scenario, the aRI initiates the process, acting as a \n“cortical outflow hub” that coordinates activity changes across multiple \nbrain networks in response to error detection (Chang et al., 2013, 2012 ). \nBeyond the dACC and aRI, there are three additional regions of in-\nterest. The presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) facilitates the se-\nlection of action plans and the suppression of conflicting action plans \n(Nachev, 2007 ), allowing the motorcyclist to decide to, say, swerve left \ninstead of right. The amygdala plays, among other things, a role in threat \ndetection (Ohman, 2005 ; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005 ), responding to \nnovel events in the environment, though it is especially sensitive to \nnovel dangers —like the motorcyclist being cut off by that car. Finally, \nthe dopaminergic regions including the ventral striatum and the ventral \ntegmental area are involved in motivation, reward and the reinforce -\nment of behavior (Beier et al., 2015 ), including unpredictable, high-risk \nbehaviors such as swerving a motorcycle in traffic. \n2.4. T 1: Error Signaling \nMoving forward in our sequence, once the salience network detects a \nperceptual change, the brain generates an error signal that helps lock \nattention on target. This requires many of the regions involved in the \norienting of attention to a perceptual event, including the posterior \nparietal cortex, as well as the frontal and subcortical control systems of \nspatial attention (Husain and Rorden, 2003; Mesulam, 1999 ). Addi-\ntionally, the dACC remains active, as this region is partially responsible \nfor reorienting. \nIt is likely that there is an event-related potential (ERP) associated \nwith this error detection. Based on the relevant literature, candidates \ninclude an error-relative negativity signal appearing 80–100 ms after the \nstimulus (Muzammel et al., 2018 ) or the N200, a negative deflection \nappearing 200 ms after the stimulus reflecting either conscious attention \nor an unexpected stimulus or both (Muzammel et al., 2018; Patel and \nAzzam, 2005 ). Relatedly, Grahek et al. (2022) have shown that the P3b \n(a signature of prediction error updating) tracks perceived efficacy at \nachieving rewards. In short, there is a stronger P3b response when \npeople update from a low-efficacy of achieving a reward to a \nhigh-efficacy prediction. Together, these error signals may help guide \nthe allocation of selective attention and control necessary for experi -\nencing flow. \n2.5. T 2: selective attention \nAt this stage in our scenario, the motorcyclist recognizes the car and \nits potential danger. A central, but still somewhat unanswered question \nis how the brain, in a high-risk situation, is able to appropriately filter \nout an enormous amount of incoming information in order to perform the correct action and make adaptive decisions. This neurobiological \nfiltering phenomenon is known as sensory gating (Jones et al., 2016 ; \nZabelina et al., 2015 ), and is a core component of cognitive control \nwherein prepotent stimuli are downregulated to facilitate flexible and \nadaptive pursuit of a specific goal (Cole et al., 2013; Miller and Cohen, \n2001 ). \nThis process functions as an attentional regulation mechanism and \nappears involved in the transition into both flow and PTSD. Importantly, \nrecent research in mice has shown that executive attention —as related \nto sensory gating —rather than acting as spotlight, is actually regulated \nby inhibition, similar to a filtering process (Wimmer et al., 2015 ). In this \nprocess, the thalamus serves as a bottom-up relay hub, communicating \nselected information to large areas within the cortex, including the \nattentional system in the prefrontal cortex. This process is heavily \ninfluenced by motivation and reward processing, which guide control \ndeployment (Botvinick and Braver, 2014 ). \nYet this is not solely a bottom-up process, as Wimmer et al. (2015) \nfound a top-down feedback loop wherein changes in PFC activity inhibit \nsensory components of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Thus, the \nPFC regulates thalamic activity by allowing relevant information to be \nprocessed, while suppressing irrelevant information via various sub-\nnetworks. In follow up research, Nakajima et al. (2019) , discovered that \nthe relevant inhibitory pathway extends from the PFC to basal ganglia \n(BG) to TRN. \nIn the PFC-BG-TRN pathway, the BG inhibits distracting and irrele -\nvant information, while enhancing appropriate cues. In our motorcyclist \nexample, it is likely that the driver experiences the dampening of \nauditory information in favor of the highlighting of visual information, a \ncommonly reported phenomenon in high-risk situations (Parr and Fris-\nton, 2018; Kotler, 2013 ). This is a form of goal-directed sensory filtering \nthat impacts attention and, via additional BG connections, motor per-\nformance. This also means that cognition is intimately tied to action and \nfurther underscores the “ability to act” versus the \"inability to act” as a \nkey differentiator between experience outcomes (flow or PTSD). Addi-\ntionally, during threat recognition, two other processes involving the BG \nare important to this discussion: the phasic response in dopamine (DA), \nsignaling a reward-prediction error (Schultz, 2016 ; see T 3 for further \ndiscussion), and the inhibition of impulsive behaviors (see below). \nOn the flow side of our motorcyclist scenario, the selection of \nappropriate motor plans must correlate with a specific neurobiological \nmechanism, with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) the likely candidate. \nBallanger et al. (2009) found that stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus \n(STN), via connections with the motor cortex, increases impulsive \nbehavior during high-conflict decision making, while an opposing \n“proactive inhibition ” response (braking, in the motorcyclist ’s scenario) \nhinders performance in high-risk situations that demand an immediate \nmotor response. The authors appropriately refer to this model as \n“release your horses. ” \n2.6. T 3: task engagement verses disengagement \nConcurrent with events described in T 2, core neuromodulatory \nprocesses are likely engaged as the motorcyclist ’s reorienting response \nactivates noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways as well as the \nendocannabinoid system (ECS) in order to enhance executive attention, \nmotor response and reward. We will address these systems individually. \nAs a core hub in the salience network, the dACC helps focus attention \non a single target by triggering the release of norepinephrine from the \nlocus coeruleus (LC), the brainstem nucleus responsible for most of the \nbrain ’s norepinephrine (Seeley et al., 2007; Berridge and Waterhouse, \n2003; Mather et al., 2016; Ventura et al., 2008; Menon and Uddin, \n2010 ). Connections running between the LC and the amygdala and be-\ntween the LC and the PFC are centrally involved in fear processing, \nattention switching, task-engagement, and increased learning (Corbetta \nand Shulman, 2002 ). Further connections run between the LC and the \nmotor cortex (M1) that extend to our facial muscles and eyes (Ferrucci S. Kotler et al."

This could explain why changes in facial expression have \nbeen repeatedly correlated with flow and trauma (for flow: de Manzano \net al., 2010 ; for trauma: Garrett et al., 2012 ). \nIn the amygdala, the arrival of NE begins the process of threat \nassessment (Gu et al., 2019;LeDoux, 2015 ). It appears that NE arrives \nfirst in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is both critical for forming \nstimulus outcome value representations (Pizzagalli et al., 2011 ), and as \nan adaptive response that primes learning. As both flow and trauma \nresult in rapid learning, the presence of NE in the BLA might help explain \nthis phenomenon. \nIn the PFC, NE increases signal-to-noise ratios in cortical networks \n(Xing et al., 2016 ) and triggers many of the top-down processes asso-\nciated with executive attention. NE projections in the PFC are \nwell-distributed but are particularly active in the medial prefrontal \ncortex (mPFC). While the amygdala-LC pathway is critical for creating \naversive memories, the LC-mPFC pathway is crucial to extinguishing \naversive memories, suggesting that this is an important division between \nflow and PTSD. Additionally, pharmacological targeting of the LC-NE \npathways in both the amygdala and mPFC has provided symptomatic \nrelief for people suffering from PTSD (Taylor et al., 2008 ). \nIn high-risk situations such as our motorcyclist ’s, NE is also involved \nin decreasing and suppressing working memory in favor of flexible \nattention (Berridge and Spencer, 2016 ). In times of stress, Snyder et al. \n(2012) have shown that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) acts as a \nneurotransmitter in the LC, shifting discharge from phasic to tonic in \norder to promote behavioral flexibility. As there are bidirectional con-\nnections between the LC and mPFC and orbital frontal cortex (OFC), this \nshift from phasic to tonic carries information up to the PFC (Berridge and \nWaterhouse, 2003 ). According to Adaptive-Gain Theory (Aston-Jones \nand Cohen, 2005 ), this shift reflects a change from the exploitation of a \nknown strategy for producing behavioral outcomes (a phasic process) to \nan exploration of a novel strategy for new and potentially preferential \noutcomes (a tonic process). \nInversely, Sadacca et al. (2017) has shown that depletion of tonic NE \nin the OFC and, possibly, the mPFC, can result in a lack of attentional \nflexibility —which could help explain why experiences become either \ntrauma or flow. Based on this evidence, we suggest that, if the motor -\ncyclist does not have enough tonic NE in their system, they may not have \nenough attentional flexibility to solve the swerve problem, resulting in \ntraumatic stress. Further evidence for this can be found in the fMRI work \nof Naegeli et al. (2018) who found PTSD patients have exaggerated \nbehavioral and autonomic responses to loud sounds, suggesting sensi-\ntized phasic responses of LC neurons (for a review of NE-LC-PTSD \nresearch, see: Borodovitsyna et al., 2018) . \nAnother line of evidence for the causal role of the LC-NE system in \nattentional control, particularly goal-directed attention and impulse \ncontrol, comes from Bari et al. (2020) . Using optogenetics, the authors \ndemonstrate that the LC targets two different areas of the PFC, the \ndorsal-medial PFC (dmPFC), known to be involved in enhancing focus \nand performance, and the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (vlOFC), \nknown to be involved in impulse reduction, with each area acting \nindependently, yet synergistically, via ascending efferent connections \nfrom the LC (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002 ). In mice, separately stimu -\nlating the LC-NE pathways to the dmPFC and the vlOFC produces two \ndistinct behavioral outcomes, either improved correct performance or \nimpulse control, respectively. Moreover, the LC-NE system also acts as \nglobal modulator for arousal in response to a threat or stressor (Morris \net al., 2020 ), which further emphasizes this systems role in the motor -\ncyclist scenario. The LC-NE system has been theorized to play an \nimportant role in flow, particularly task engagement verses disengage -\nment (van der Linden et al., 2021 ). Taken together, the LC-NE system \nresponds to threats during high-stakes situations, regulates the decision \nto engage or disengage a task, and modulates two distinct attentional \npathways, one involved in reducing distracting information and the \nother in reducing impulsive behaviors. \nInterestingly, researchers have also found that both flow and traumatic stress are associated with out-of-body experiences (Blanke \nand Thut, 2007; Rabeyron and Caussie, 2016 ; Kotler, 2006 ), a phe-\nnomenon that might be partially explained by NE activity in the tem-\nporal parietal junction. In the TPJ, NE is normally linked to failure \ntracking, but the region (and especially the right TPJ) is also important \nin empathy, perspective-taking and out-of-body experiences (Sha-\nmay-Tsoory et al., 2005 ; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003 ; Blanke and Arzy, \n2005 ). This suggests that an out of body experience might be a \nNE-triggered radical form of perspective-taking that arises early in \nperceived crisis situations, arguably during the pre-action plan selection \nphase, perhaps to aid in that selection. \nWhen the brain detects a salient signal, there is also activity in the \nmesocorticolimbic dopamine system anchored by the ventral tegmental \narea (VTA). The VTA provides signals related to novelty, error and \nreward, yet there is growing evidence that there are two different kinds \nof DA neurons and that each responds to a specific kind of “reward ” \n(Bromberg-Martin, 2010 ). The first are value-coding neurons that are \nactivated by unexpected rewarding events and inhibited by unexpected \naversive events. These value-coding neurons are found in the substantia \nnigra (SN) and the VTA, while their projections end in the NAcc shell, \ndorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) and vmPFC (Schultz, 2007 ). \nThe second class of DA neurons are saliency-coding neurons that \noriginate in the substantia nigra and VTA and project to the NAcc core, \ndorsal striatum, and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC). In both classes of DA \nneurons in the VTA, activity is both phasic and tonic and relates to both \nexpectation of reward and errors in reward prediction (Schultz, 2016 ). \nAdditionally, DeYoung (2013) proposed these saliency-neurons are \nactivated by the incentive value of new information; while Di Domenico \nand Ryan (2017) argue that these neurons alone could underpin intrinsic \nmotivation —two ideas that are relevant to flow ’s phenomenological \ncharacteristics and impact on performance. \nYet, in our motorcycle example, the value-coding DA neurons are \nactivated first, as the unexpected aversive event —the car’s arrival in the \nmotorcyclist ’s visual field —would produce a reward prediction error \nand a phasic decline in DA activity (Schultz, 2016 ). This may be the \noriginal error signal that starts the entire flow or trauma process (dis-\ncussed in T 1). However, this phasic DA decline must be brief, as flow \nhas been consistently linked to heightened dopaminergic activity (Berns, \n2005; Weber et al., 2009 ). Moreover, DA-producing experiences such as \nrisk, unpredictability, complexity, novelty, and insight, appear to pre-\ncipitate flow (Kotler, 2006, 2021 ). Finally, flow-proneness is associated \nwith availability of D2 receptors in the dorsal striatum (de Manzano \net al., 2013 ) and increased dorsal striatum gray matter volume (Kavous \net al., 2019 ). \nAt this step in the sequence, the phenomenology of time perception \ncomes into play. In crisis situations, both anecdotal and empirical evi-\ndence (Kotler, 2013 ) show that time appears to slow down or speed up \nvery early in high-risk situations. Similarly, Arstila (2012) argues that \nthis effect occurs due to a distortion of the relation between the temporal \nproperties of the external world and the internal state. Dopamine may be \nresponsible for this change in temporal phenomenology, as it is the main \nneurotransmitter involved in time processing (Lustig and Meck, 2005; \nMeck, 1996 ). Dopamine agonists tend to speed up time perception, \nwhereas dopamine antagonists slow it down. In our motorcycle \nexample, the initial reward detection error would likely produce a \nphasic decline in DA that would slow the rider ’s perception of time. \nAdditionally, Roseboom (2019) correlated the experience of time dila-\ntion to the number of salient events which take place during a particular \nscanning period. The greater the number of salient events, the longer the \ncurrent moment seems to last. In other words, the activation of the \nmotorcyclist ’s salience network could begin the process of time elon-\ngation, while the presence of dopamine could extend and/or deepen the \nphenomenon. Importantly, these processes provide a mechanism for \ntime dilation that arises very early in the motorcyclist ’s experience \nwithout requiring the localized deactivation of the medial PFC (see T 8 \nfor full discussion).

      "text": "Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956\n6A significant body of research shows the endocannabinoid system \n(ECS) is a regulator of anxiety and stress (for a review, see Hillard, \n2018 ), and thus implicated in our motorcyclist ’s response to the event. \nIn a wide variety of situations, the introduction of an acute stressor —the \ncar, in our example —evokes bidirectional changes in the two main \nmolecules produced by the ECS: anandamide (AEA) and 2-archidonoly \nglycerol (2-AG). These molecules are synthesized on-demand in post-\nsynaptic membranes that feed back into presynaptic terminals (Kano \net al., 2009 ), where they bind to canabiniond recepters (CB) receptors \nand serve a significant neuromodulatory function. Within the brain, CB \nreceptors are found on GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, norad -\nrenergic and dopaminergic terminals —a list that includes many of the \nneurochemicals directly implicated in both flow and trauma, suggesting \nthat the ECS may be something of a master neuromodulator of these \nexperiences. \nIn the amygdala (see T 4 for further review), where the threat \nresponse is processed, CB receptors are primarily found in the baso-\nlateral amygdala (BLA), but also in the central nucleus. When these \nreceptors are inhibited, there is a decline in anandamide (AEA) in the \namygdala that contributes to the stress response by activating the \nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increasing anxiety. \nAdditionally, increases in 2-AG, the other major molecule produced by \nthe ECS, contribute to the termination and adaptation of the HPA \naxis—that is, the end of the threat response —and potentially contribute \nto pain perception, memory and synaptic plasticity (Gray, 2015 ). In \ntotal, a decline in ECS activity is associated with anxiety and traumatic \nstress, while (as we will see below) an increase in ECS activity may \nprevent traumatic stress and enhance correct task-performance and \nattention, two key components of the flow experience. \n2.7. T 4: threat assessment \nIn this sequence, the neurobiological changes described in T \n0 through T 3 reflect the motorcyclist ’s detection of an aversive and \nunexpected stimulus. Here, in T 4, the motorcyclist ’s brain performs \nthreat assessments and begins the process of action plan selection. We \nexamine these details by focusing on key neuronal regions that are \ndirectly implicated in both neurobiological studies of flow and trauma, \nand by events necessitated by our motorcyclist ’s scenario —the activa -\ntion of the salience network by an unexpected stimulus, for example. \nIn the brain, sensory information about the external environ -\nment —such as the sudden appearance of a car in our motorcyclist ’s \nvisual field —is processed by a pulvino-cortical loop that regulates se-\nlective attention (Saalmann et al., 2012 ) and then relayed to the \namygdala through a network of corticothalamic afferents. The amygdala \nhandles preconscious threat detection, emotional valence and, via \nnear-constant bidirectional signaling with the mPFC and the hippo -\ncampus, associations with prior experience (Bishop, 2009; Hermans \net al., 2014 ). Bidirectional links between the central amygdala, brain -\nstem and hypothalamus are responsible for mounting fear responses \n(Adolphs, 2013 ). In our scenario, in both the flow and trauma condi -\ntions, amygdala activity is likely, as the car represents a dire and im-\nmediate threat that produces a fear response. \nIn this fear response, sensory information is funneled into the basal \nand basomedial cell groups, and the central nucleus of the amygdala \n(Janak and Tye, 2015 ). The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in \nsurvival-oriented behaviors such as freezing, fleeing, foraging, and \n(possibly) fighting, and forms a circuit with the centrolateral amygdala, \n(CLA) which is a critical structure for fear memory formation and stor-\nage (Penzo et al., 2015 ). In mice, Hartley et al. (2019) found the central \namygdala (CeA) is also involved in fear creation and extinction. CeA \nneurons express corticotropin-release neuropeptide CRF, which re-\nduces conditioned freezing responses, impairs fear memory acquisition, \nfacilitates within-activity fear extinction, and is necessary for extinction \nmemory retrieval. Meanwhile, activity in corticotropin-release CRF- \nneurons produces fear-based memories. These facts are relevant for two reasons. First, in order to facilitate \nthe swerve action plan, the motorcyclist had to inhibit automatic \nbraking responses, a function of CRFactivity. Second, the autotelic \nnature of flow suggests within-activity fear extinction and post-event \nfear extinction, both functions of CRF. This second argument is \ncrucial as no averse affective memory responses have been associated \nwith flow, yet the state frequently arises in high-risk situations that \nwould normally produce them (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ; Celsi, 1993 ; \nKotler, 2013 ). \nAdditionally, the endocannabinoid system (ESC) also plays a role in \nthreat assessment, as it can both inhibit or excite CRH response. More \nspecifically, there are both tonic and phasic ECS reactions to stress. In \nthe brain, higher tonic levels of AEA regulate stress and anxiety and play \na role in the prevention of PTSD (Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013; Mayo et al., \n2022 ). AEA is also the tonic signal of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis \n(HPA), which is partially responsible for mounting the stress response. \nUnder steady-state conditions, Morena et al. (2015) argued that this AEA \ntone exists in the BLA, where it inhibits the HPA under non-stressful \nconditions, and activates it under stress. Interestingly, the ECS system \nis also active in the hippocampus and the mPFC, both regions critical for \nfear-based associative processing, and over large portions of the PFC in \ngeneral, including most of the regions active in threat processing, \naction-plan selection, and the creation or extinction of fear-based \nmemories. In total, mounting evidence suggests that the ECS plays a \nsignificant neuromodulatory role in both the onset of flow and the onset \nof trauma. \nDuring threat assessment, information is also passed to the prefrontal \ncortex for top-down evaluation (for a review, see Sussman et al., 2016 ). \nA network involving the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), the orbital \nfrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) helps \nreorient attention to salient stimuli and is particularly sensitive to un-\nexpected events (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002 ). Beyond these structures, \nit appears that the specific prefrontal regions activated during threat \nevaluation will differ depending on the situation, past knowledge, and \nprior experience. In the flow literature, critical factors that help establish \nthe challenge-skills balance such as tolerance for anxiety, ability to delay \ngratification, confidence, and optimism, are influential at this stage, and \nlikely determine the exact pattern of prefrontal activity. Yet there are a \nfew areas in the PFC that deserve particular scrutiny for their relevance \nto our scenario. \nIn the motorcyclist example, in both flow and trauma, the appear -\nance of an unexpected stimulus makes OFC activity likely. The OFC is \nconsidered part of the vmPFC (discussed in greater detail below) and has \nbeen implicated in both emotion and emotion-related learning, and is \npart of the ventral network that reorients attention to salient stimuli and \nemotional events (Thorpe, 1992 ; Hartikainen et al., 2012; O’Doherty \net al., 2001; Rule et al., 2002 ). Yet, there are important OFC divisions. In \namygdala-generated fear responses, both the medial OFC and the \nventromedial PFC (see below) are implicated in fear extinction and \nreward-processing, while the anterolateral OFC signals the absence of a \nreward and presence of certain negative stimuli (Milad and Rauch, \n2007 ). In trauma studies, anterolateral OFC dysfunction has been \nimplicated in PTSD. \nRelatedly, the vmPFC has bidirectional connection to the amygdala \nand is involved in threat assessment and response, reward-processing, \nand decision-making —all tasks that are required at this stage of the \nevent (Botvinick et al., 2001; Fellows, 2007; Rolls, 2000 ). Moreover, the \nvmPFC assists in the selection of action plans (Yim, Cai and Wang, 2019 ) \nand with solving problems associated with determining the actions of \nambiguous agents —the car in this scenario (Vartanian and Mandel, \n2011 ). Evidence also shows that both the amygdala and the vmPFC are \nactive during the extinction of fear memories (Janak and Tye, 2015 ). \nThis idea aligns with studies of flow in rappers and musicians (Limb and \nBraun, 2008; Liu et al., 2012 ) showing heightened activity in the \nvmPFC —perhaps as a result of the creative decision-making and action \nplan selection required by improvisation. Yet, other researchers (e.g., S. Kotler et al."

      "text": "Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956\n7Barros et al., 2018; Huskey et al., 2018; Klasen et al., 2012; Ulrich et al., \n2014, 2016a,b, 2022 ) found reduced activity across the whole of the \nmPFC during flow, including the vmPFC. This discrepancy could \npossibly be resolved with a better understanding of the interrelationship \nbetween the mPFC, amygdala and the endocannabinoid system. CB1 \nreceptors are plentiful in the mPFC and receptor activation by AEA in-\nhibits NE production across the entire region —suggesting a shift in fear \nprocessing (Morena, 2015 ). \nFinally, the right ventral lateral PFC (vlPFC) is involved in flexible \naction plan selection and emotional forecasting (Bechara, 2011 ), both \nprocesses that are relevant to our scenario. Yoshida et al. (2014) \ndiscovered vlPFC activity during a study of gamers in flow, a finding \nthey linked to the vlPFC ’s role in the cognitive control of memory (Badre \nand Wagner, 2007 ). Further explanation for vlPFC activity during flow \ncan be found in a frontal-striatal-thalamic loop that allows for the \nflexibility in behavior seen in high flow activities like improv jazz, video \ngaming, or a motorcyclist swerving through traffic. As this flexibility is \npresent throughout the entire flow experience and not just at state onset, \nthis could explain why Yoshida et al. (2014) found the vlPFC activated \nthroughout the flow experience, and particularly during later moments \nin the flow eliciting task. Additionally, upregulating CB1 receptor \nbinding in the vlPFC promotes stress-coping strategies following un-\npredictable stress exposure (McLaughlin et al., 2014; Wirz et al., 2018 ). \nIf the ECS is modulating the vlPFC during flow, this further explains why \nflow is likely to lead to post-traumatic growth and not post-traumatic \nstress disorder. \n2.8. T 5: threat processing \nFollowing the threat assessment seen in T 4, as the motorcyclist \nrecognizes the imminent danger, threat processing occurs T 5. This \nwill likely require multiple structures within both the executive atten -\ntion network and salience network, but a full anatomical breakdown is \nperhaps unnecessary. We know that a threat is detected in our motor -\ncyclist ’s experience because both of our conditions —flow and trauma -\n—activate the sympathetic nervous system. In humans, when the \namygdala detects danger, it sends a threat signal to the hypothalamus \nthat results in the release of cortisol. This phenomenon is well- \ndocumented in the study of trauma (Bremner, 2006; Sherin and Nem-\neroff, 2011 ), but it appears in flow as well. A number of studies of flow \nhave found that cortisol levels follow an inverted U-shaped curve (Keller \net al., 2011; Peifer et al., 2014; Tozman and Peifer, 2016 ). Tozman and \ncolleagues (2017) for example, examined cortisol levels in chess players \nin flow, finding a moderate level of cortisol was associated with a higher \nlevel of flow absorption, while a higher level of cortisol was associated \nwith a lower level of flow absorption. This finding suggests that flow \nmay require some kind of stress response at the front end of the \nexperience. \n2.9. T 6: the acute stress response in flow and trauma \nReturning to our hypothetical situation: The motorcyclist ’s visuo -\nspatial attention is now directed toward the oncoming car, while the \ndriver ’s threat recognition system (Stein and Nesse, 2011 ) has identified \na significant and imminent danger. From a cognitive-affective perspec -\ntive, multiple psychobiological systems are now engaged, perhaps most \nimportantly the acute stress or fight-flight-freeze response of the sym-\npathetic nervous system. In this scenario, given the situational context, \nmovement suppression and behavioral inhibition are not likely to occur, \nthus freezing is not an option (Roelofs, 2017 ). Instead, from a neuro -\nphenomenological point of view, we argue that the transition into flow is \nlikely associated with the proactive willingness to approach, and the \ntransition into trauma is associated with the reactive inclination to avoid \n(Roelofs, 2017 ). From an objective standpoint, the motorcyclist pro-\nduces the same “swerve ” motor action plan, however, phenomenologi -\ncally, it may be the case that a decision to “approach ” leads to the state of flow, while the decision to “avoid ” leads to trauma, with the former \nproducing concurrent feelings of fortitude, and the latter producing \nconcurrent feelings of fear. It is further likely that, subsequent to the \nevent, these two distinct neurobiological reactions would be associated \nwith different psychological outcomes: the absence of fear-based \nmemories in the flow condition, and the presence of fear-based mem-\nories in the trauma condition (Izquierdo et al., 2016 ). A deeper \nconsideration of the underlying neurobiology is warranted here. \nRecent work in mice (Salay et al., 2018 ) has clarified that freeze \nresponses are controlled by xiphoid nucleus (a substructure in the \nventral midline thalamus) projections to the BLA. By comparison, fight \nresponses invoke projections from the nucleus reuniens (a structure that \nsurrounds the xiphoid nucleus) to the mPFC. The argument being \nexplored here is that the transition toward flow begins with a signal sent \nfrom the ventral midline thalamus to themPFC that activates the “fight ” \nmotor-action plan. \nIt is unclear if this “fight ” signal is always required to create flow, or \nif flow results from more general approach and avoidance processes (e. \ng., Cacioppo et al., 1999 ). Yet, in high-risk situations, three ideas support \nthe activation of the fight response. First, Benson and Proctor (2004) \nsuggested that the psychological experience of “struggle ” always pre-\ncedes entrance into flow. Second, braking is the standard automatic \nresponse to a visual threat, yet this instinct is inhibited in this scenario \nand replaced by the swerve motor-action plan. Temporal constraints \ndictate that action plan selection must occur immediately after the SN \ndetects a threat, with the nucleus reuniens -mPFC pathway representing \nthe hypothetical “shortest path ” to activation. Finally, path selec-\ntion—fight or flight —is responsible for the reactivation or further sup-\npression of the ECS, which plays a significant role in determining \noutcomes associated with either flow or trauma. More specifically, at T \n3, the introduction of an acute stressor downregulated tonic AEA \nproduction in the amygdala and hippocampus. In the flow condition, \nafter the ventral midline thalamus activates the fight response, we see an \nincrease in sympathetic signaling that releases cortisol and reactivates \ntonic AEA production in the amygdala. The evidence for tonic AEA \nreactivation is twofold. First, researchers consistently find amygdala \ndownregulation during flow (Limb and Braun, 2008; Ulrich et al., \n2016a, 2022 ; Liu et al., 2012 ) and this necessitates the presence of AEA. \nSecond, our flow-condition motorcyclist does not experience \nin-situation feelings of fear and does not have post-event fear memories, \nand both require the presence of AEA (Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013 ). \nAdditionally, in the trauma condition, continual inhibition of AEA \nproduces fear conditioning, creates fear-memories and is a contributing \nfactor in the later development of PTSD (Wyrofsky et al., 2019 ). \n2.10. T 7: action plan selection \nAfter threat detection and the sympathetic response detailed in T \n6, the motorcyclist selects the “swerve ” action plan. There are a number \nof lines of evidence that show the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex \n(dACC) is involved in action plan selection alongside its aforementioned \nroles (See T 0 and T 1). As Brockett et al. (2020) wrote: “Decades of \nimaging and modeling research in humans have implicated the anterior \ncingulate cortex in the evaluation of situational demands and the hy-\npothesized alterations of downstream nodes such as the dorsal medial \nstriatum that facilitate appropriate action plan selection. ” More specif -\nically, Shenhav et al. (2016) has argued that the dACC is particularly \nsensitive to environmental changes that require a rapid motor response, \nwhich is the case in our motorcycle scenario. Furthermore, cognitively \ndemanding tasks —such as swerving in traffic — activate the dorsal ACC \nand deactivate the posterior ACC (Binder et al., 1999; Drevets and \nRaichle, 1998; Raichle et al., 2001 ). \nAction plan selection is modulated by dopamine, as D1 DA receptors \nin the ACC regulate effort-based decision-making (Schweimer and \nHauber, 2006 ). Furthermore, once a decision is made and the action \nplan selected, as a way to drive reinforcement learning, there is a further S. Kotler et al."

      "text": "Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956\n8increase in dopaminergic transmission in the right dACC (Holroyd et al., \n2004 ). In the flow scenario, this increase in DA signaling amplifies the \nsignal-to-noise ratio in PFC (Kroener et al., 2009 ) and could be \nresponsible for the heightened creativity that has been consistently \ncorrelated with the state. Additionally, this dopaminergic activity likely \nexplains why “clear goals ” and “immediate feedback ” function as flow \ntriggers. If “clear goals ” are coded into the reward system and DA ac-\ntivity is linked to effort-based decision-making, then having a clear goal \nmay favor action over inaction, and further explain the division between \nflow and trauma. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of dACC neurons to error \nresponses and error feedback, coupled with DA neurons ’ \nwell-established reward sensitivity, may explain why immediate feed-\nback facilitates flow onset. \nFurthermore, one of flow ’s most interesting phenomenological at-\ntributes is the sensation of flow itself, often described as effortless effort, \nwhere the experience is that every action and every decision being \nperformed leads seamlessly, perfectly, fluidly to the next (Csikszentmi -\nhalyi, 1990; Kotler, 2013 ). This suggests that dACC activity is not \nlimited to state onset. As subjects in flow select numerous, sequential \naction plans, dACC activity may persist throughout the experience. In \nfact, research shows that the dACC is functionally connected with the \ndlPFC during flow (Huskey et al., 2018 ), which may further facilitate \nphenomenological experience of “clear goals ” and “immediate feed-\nback ” specifically, and more generally, may explain why so many \nresearch subjects have described their phenomenological experience of \nthe state as “flowy. ” However, a challenge to this interpretation is that \nother studies have shown lower activation in the ACC during flow \n(Huskey et al., 2018; Klasen et al., 2012; Ulrich et al., 2016a, 2022). \n2.11. T 8: The onset of flow \nAt this moment, our motorcyclist executes the swerve action plan \nand rapidly transitions into flow. For the purposes of this hypothetical \nsituation, assume the swerve consists of three different miniature action \nplans: an initial swerve away from the car, a second movement to \ncounter-balance the out-thrust of the first, and a final adjustment to re- \ncenter the motorcycle along its new trajectory. When the motorcyclist \nperforms the initial swerve away from the car, there is an increase in \ndopaminergic reward signaling in the mesocorticolimbic pathway that \ncorresponds with the successful execution of this first action plan. \nAdditionally, “rebound-excitation theory ” suggests that DA provides a \npost-acute stress safety signal that inhibits fear-processing neurons in a \nspatially and temporally controlled manner (J.C. Lee et al., 2016; E.M. \nLee et al., 2016 ). For example, experiments in acute stress conditions \nshowed phasic rebound-excitation of DA neurons in the VTA at the offset \nof aversive stimuli, with DA signal strength time-locked to the termi -\nnation of fearful events. A weak signal promotes fearful memories and \nanxious behavior, while a strong one extinguishes fearful memories and \npromotes resilience (J.C. Lee et al., 2016; E.M. Lee et al., 2016 ). In our \nflow example, once our motorcyclist recognizes that the first of the three \nmini-action plans is actually working, a DA safety signal should arise. \nThe initial dopaminergic reward will likely produce a feeling of \nsurprise, as this is the phenomenological signal that arises during the \nrecognition of better than expected results, and provokes a P300 event- \nrelated potential (ERP). However, there are two types of P300 ERPs. The \nP300a is associated with novelty; the P300b with surprise (Polich, \n2007 ). In our motorcyclist ’s scenario, the signal is a P300b, as an \nabundance of oddball paradigm experiments show that a novel and \nunexpected stimulus produces a P300b wave approximately 300–400 \nms following presentation (Picton, 1992 ). \nIn this scenario, we speculate there are four reasons to predict a P300 \nat T 8. First, unless our motorcyclist is a professional, it is unlikely that \nswerving around a car is a single well-rehearsed motor plan. Thus, the \nsuccessful execution of each mini-plan would be surprising to our driver. \nSecond, the P300 has also been related to appraisal updating —the threat \nof the car is updated into something less dangerous as the swerve starts to work, with the wave ’s amplitude heightening based on stimulus \nprobability and task-relevance (Donchin and Coles, 1988 ). Third, \nstudies have shown that flow proneness is associated with DA receptor \nactivity (de Manzano et al., 2013; Gyurkovics et al., 2016 ). This matters \nbecause traits long associated with DA receptor activity —sensation \nseeking, introversion-to-extroversion, and impulsivity —have also been \ncorrelated with the P300 (Stelmack and Houlihan, 1994 ). Fourth, our \nin-flow motorcyclist has no post-incident fear despite having accurate \nmemories of the event. It is known that stimulus encoding that promotes \nsuccessful memory storage and retrieval will increase P300 amplitude \n(Azizian and Polich, 2007 ) and that signal latency is related to how long \nit takes to update a target stimulus, with verbal tasks taking longer than \nspatial tasks (Kutas et al., 1977 ). As our motorcyclist has non-fearful \nmemories and responded to a visual stimulus, we predict a P300 wave \nthat is larger in amplitude and shorter in latency. \nAdditionally, this signal —phasic DA activity —occurs immediately \nafter the first sign that outcomes are better than anticipated, and pro-\nduces subsequent pulses after each confirming sign (Holroyd et al., \n2004 ). In our example, there are a series of P300 waves, each probably \nslightly smaller in amplitude, after the successful execution of each of \nthe three mini-action plans (swerve, counter-swerve, straighten out). \n2.12. T 9: Localized hypofrontality \nAt T 8, the motorcyclist has executed the action plan and is either \nexperiencing flow or traumatic stress. Early theorizing argued that flow \nis associated with a significant downregulation of the PFC (Dietrich, \n2004 ), or what has been called “transient hypofrontality ” in the litera -\nture. Specifically, Dietrich proposed transient hypofrontality as the \nneuronal process that underlies flow and all altered states of con-\nsciousness (Dietrich, 2004 ). This idea has since been confirmed experi -\nmentally, albeit with mixed results (for a review, see Harris et al., \n2017a ). Some studies have found large-scale PFC deactivation during \nflow. Both Limb and Braun (2008) and Liu et al. (2012) observed broad \ndeactivations of the PFC in studies of musicians and rappers in flow. In \nLiu and colleague ’s work, almost all of the lateral prefrontal cortices, \nextending from the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (loPFC) to the superior \nportions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as the \ndorsal portions of the mPFC, were deactivated. \nBy comparison, the vast majority of studies have found evidence for \nmore localized hypofrontality, particularly among the medial PFC \n(mPFC). As was discussed previously, this region is thoroughly impli -\ncated in the division between flow and trauma, yet—regarding hypo -\nfrontality —it appears that the mPFC is consistently deactivated during \nflow (Barros et al., 2018; Klasen et al., 2012; Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a, \n2022 ). In fact, more recent evidence indicates that downregulation of \nthe mPFC is causally implicated in flow experiences (Ulrich et al., \n2016b ), particularly among people who have low-baseline levels of flow \nexperiences (Ulrich et al., 2018 ). Other research has shown low levels of \nmPFC activity (Huskey, Craighead et al., 2018 ), and mPFC functional \nconnectivity (Huskey et al., 2018, 2021 ) during flow. Taken together, \nthe data suggests that these PFC deactivations are localized to mPFC \nregions, and the extent of these deactivations may be based on task-set \nand task-requirements, rather than the across-the-board shutdown that \nearlier researchers had proposed (for an extended treatment, see Harris \net al., 2017a ). \nEEG studies of flow show frontal alpha and theta activity (Eschmann \net al., 2021 ; Katahira et al., 2018 ). In the work done by Katahira et al. \n(2018) , frontal theta was localized to frontal-midline regions, which is \nimplicated in cognitive control (Cavanagh and Frank, 2014 ) and con-\ncentration (Lagopoulos et al., 2009 ). This finding is related to the \nincreased effort and increased cognitive control required to produce \nflow (when both task challenge and individual skills are moderate to \nhigh) and to task absorption (a complete concentration and merger of \naction and awareness condition). Eschmann et al. (2021) have shown \nthat increased fronto-medial theta is associated with increased flow, and S. Kotler et al."

Similarly, the alpha oscil-\nlations in Katahira ’s study were found over the frontal central and \nfrontal right cortical areas and tended to increase with task difficulty. As \nalpha has been repeatedly correlated with heightened creativity (Lus-\ntenberger et al., 2015 ) this increase could further account for the \namplified creativity seen in flow. Other EEG work has shown increased \nfronto-alpha power during flow, particularly in midline regions, which \nhas been interpreted as relating to the reward-modulated deployment of \ncognitive control (Castellar et al., 2019 ). \nIn summary, it appears that hypofrontality is localized to the mPFC, a \nstructure that is a core component of the default mode network (Raichle \net al., 2001 ) and is heavily implicated in self-referential processing \n(Northoff et al., 2006 ). That the mPFC is consistently downregulated \nduring flow may explain why a core phenomenological characteristic of \nflow is diminished self-awareness and self-reflection. By comparison, \nflow seems to require large-scale activity across the PFC, excluding the \nmPFC, but including the ACC. Together, this accounts for recent theo-\nrizing that flow requires high levels of cognitive control (Fisher et al., \n2021; Weber et al., 2009, 2016; Weber and Fisher, 2020 ), which may \nexplain why flow feels simultaneously high-control, but effortless (see \nalso, Harris et al., 2017b ; Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ). \n3.A theoretical perspective on the neural dynamics for the \nonset of flow \nIn this paper, in addition to the neurobiological mechanisms dis-\ncussed in sections T 0 through T 9, we also propose a neural \ndynamical framework for the onset of flow. Here, the term “neural dy-\nnamics ” refers to how the brain exchanges information via oscillation, \nthat is, how neural oscillatory activity in one brain region affects, or is \nstatistically correlated, with neural activity in another brain region. \nThese dynamical networks are how the brain changes its state over time. \nFrom a theoretical perspective, understanding the neural dynamics \ninvolved in our motorcycle scenario —that is, understanding how the \nneuronal regions involved in the onset of flow become functionally \ncoupled or uncoupled —may yield new empirical and testable insights \nabout the mechanisms involved, and lay the groundwork for a compu -\ntational modeling approach. \nFunctional connectivity (FC) between brain regions is defined as the \nstatistical dependence between neural time series regardless of their \ndirect anatomical connections (Friston, 1994 ). These patterns of activ-\nity, as captured by EEG, MEG or fMRI, can be effectively measured using \na variety of functional connectivity analysis (Wang et al., 2014 ). The \nresulting data reveals the flow of information among and within brain \nnetworks and is critical for linking these networks and their dynamics to \ncognitive and phenomenological states (such as flow). For example, \nusing correlation either in the time or frequency domains, will yield \nundirected and symmetrical, shared information among the network \n(Barnett et al., 2020 ). Directed functional connectivity analysis, on the \nother hand, can yield causal connectivity, i.e., the direction of infor-\nmation flow between nodes in the network (Friston et al., 2003; Man-\nnino and Bressler, 2015; Bressler and Seth, 2011 ). \nGiven that one of the known phenomenological correlates of flow is \nhyper-focused, task-specific attention, the underlying neural dynamics \nshould reflect a task-engaged cognitive state. This task-engagement in-\nvolves the activation of task-dependent networks, such as the dorsal \nattention network and fronto-parietal control network, and is often \ncontrasted to resting state or task-negative networks, such as the default \nmode network (DMN; Fox et al., 2005) . Typically, the activity of these \nnetworks is anti-correlated, though recent evidence has revealed a more \nnuanced account wherein different network components may be \nsimultaneously active. In fact, evidence shows that tasks performed \nautomatically (Vatansever et al., 2017 ), or with low levels of difficulty \n(Huskey et al., 2018b,a, Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a, 2018, 2022 ) tend to \nengage the DMN. Other research shows that, during goal-directed cognition, the DMN is functionally coupled with both task-positive \nattentional networks and task-positive frontoparietal control networks \n(Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014; Christoff et al., 2016; Spreng, 2012; Xu \net al., 2020 ; Dixon et al., 2016 ). \nDuring flow, typically anti-correlated networks appear to be co- \nactivated. The hyper-focus associated with flow requires activation of \ntask-positive attentional networks. Yet, flow also shares considerable \noverlap with a task-negative cognitive state, the psychedelic state \n(Csikszentmihalyi and Nakamura, 2018 ). This overlap includes \nphenomenological elements such as the diminishment of self, an altered \nsense of time (dilation or acceleration), and the merger of action and \nawareness, as well as behavioral elements, such as a measurable increase \nin creativity (divergent thinking) and insight. Therefore, a deeper un-\nderstanding of the neural dynamics of the psychedelic state is useful for \ninforming our examination of flow ’s neural dynamics. \nUsing magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the neural \ndynamics of the psychedelic state, Barnett et al. (2020) found a simul -\ntaneous decrease in directed functional connectivity and an increase in \nundirected functional connectivity (particularly in the LSD condition). \nThe authors interpret this network co-activation as consistent with the \n“increasing disorder and functional disorganization underlying the \npsychedelic experience ” (Barnett et al., 2020 ). Essentially, there is a \nbreakdown of ordered communication between critical brain regions. \nThis breakdown reflects a relaxation of constraints in global brain ac-\ntivity that corresponds with an expansion of the possible repertoire of \nbrain states (thereby increasing dynamic diversity). Carhart-Harris et al. \n(2018) have argued these specific changes in neural dynamics correlate \nwith the uncontrolled cognition and perception that are signature \nphenomenological aspects of the psychedelic experience. \nFrom a theoretical perspective, the psychedelic brain is at the “edge \nof criticality ” (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018 ). In any self-organizing \ndynamical system (like the brain), criticality is the transition point be-\ntween two tendencies or phases: an ordered state and a disordered, \nchaotic one. By allowing the brain to best adapt to a wide variety of \nrapidly changing external conditions, this proximity to criticality facil-\nitates optimal processing and performance. For example, Atasoy et al. \n(2017) , using power-law distributions and connectome-harmonic \ndecomposition, found that a frequency-specific re-organization of \nbrain dynamics —specifically, an increase in repertoire —brings the \nbrain closer to the edge of criticality. This is consistent with the entropic \nbrain hypothesis, metastability, the free-energy principle, and scale-free \ncortical dynamics (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019 , Kelso, 2012; Tog-\nnoli and Kelso, 2014 ; Bressler, 2008 ; Friston et al., 2020 , Freeman and \nBreakspear, 2007 ). In altered states of consciousness —including psy-\nchedelic states —mounting evidence suggests that the brain functions at \nthe edge of criticality, that is, at, or near, a metastable critical state \n(Carhart-Harris, 2018 ; Cavanna et al., 2018 ;Kelso, 2012, 2021 ; Cocchi \net al., 2017 ). \nTwo important points considered here are worth elaborating, a \ntheoretical one and a terminological one. Theoretically, given that we \nare both describing and explaining a phase transition into flow, we \nconsider flow, as an altered state of consciousness described in our hy-\npothetical situation, from a metastable perspective (Fuchs et al., 2000; \nKelso, 1992 ). Crucially, this would mean that flow is a transient phe-\nnomenon —a metastable tendency. Metastability (Kelso, 2012; Tognoli \nand Kelso, 2014 ) plays a central role in cortical coordination dynamics, \nand in general, refers to the simultaneous tendency for individual \ncomponents of system to couple together and for the individual com-\nponents to remain autonomous. It is a property of a system of coupled \noscillators, whereby the systems dynamics tend toward a stable attractor \n(coordination pattern) but are never fully trapped by that attractor. \nInstead, the system remains in an unstable pattern near the stable co-\nordination pattern. In cognitive neurodynamics for example, different \nregions of the cortex, comprised of neuronal populations, can simulta -\nneously couple and coordinate their behavior to produce certain \ncognitive functions, but also express their own individual oscillatory S.

Thus, cortical metastability produces \nthe simultaneous tendency for cortical areas to remain segregated, \nmanifesting their own intrinsic activity, and to be integrated, influ-\nencing each other by reciprocal coupling (Tognoli and Kelso, 2014 ). \nTerminologically, although we have used the word “state ” as a \ndescription of both the neural and phenomenological aspects of flow \nthroughout this paper, this may not accurately reflect reality. By defi-\nnition, state implies stability, however, considering the dynamics, i.e., \nthe possible metastable nature of the phenomenon, the term state may \nnot, ultimately, be appropriate (Kelso, 2021 ). \nRecently however, Huskey et al., 2021 , have theoretically and \nempirically compared the metastability proposal with the synchroniza -\ntion theory of flow (STF) first proposed by Weber et al. (2009) . We \ncarefully consider here the relevance of STF in the context of network \ncontrol theory and criticality. The STF proposes a functional synchro -\nnization of cognitive control (including attentional structures) and \nreward networks (RNs) in the brain, and understands flow as a syn-\nchronized brain state. \nOne open question is the nature of this connectivity. STF predicts \nthat the brain transitions through a sequence of network topologies, \nending up in a functionally connected, highly synchronized state, which \ncorresponds with the flow state (Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ). This idea \nis very similar to and sits within the concept of controllability (and \nnetwork control theory Gu et al., 2015 ; Lydon-Staley et al., 2021 ). The \nconcept of controllability states that, in terms of energy efficiency, the \nbrain optimizes its dynamics among distributed neural systems to, in this \ncase, respond to the demands of the environment. Thus, the brain or-\nganizes its dynamics to move through various cognitive states, with \nstructurally dense areas facilitating easily reachable states, and more \ndistributed regions facilitating more difficult to reach states (e.g., the \nflow state). On this account, network control theory offers an underlying \ntheoretical framework for how the brain organizes its dynamics to meet \ntask demands (for everyday living, but also for flow). STF is the specific \ncase where two systems in the brain, cognitive control systems, and \nreward – based (i.e., intrinsic motivation) systems functionally syn-\nchronize to allow the brain to reach the flow state. \nRecent work has started to probe the nature of this fronto-parietal \ncontrol network (FPCN), and the fronto-parietal reward networks \n(FPRN) connectivity. Using fMRI, Huskey et al., 2021 found increased \nflexibility among the FPCN and FPRN during flow, but decreased flexi-\nbility among the reward network only. They also found comparatively \nlow levels of synchrony in the FPCN and FPRN during flow. Meta -\nstability offers one possible explanation for this finding. From a meta-\nstability perspective, it is possible that the brain during flow is \nappropriately segregated or integrated and oscillates between these \ntendencies, rather than being attracted to them but not entering either. \nHowever, Huskey et al., 2021 did not find strong evidence supporting \nthis metastability hypothesis. With that said, other research has shown \nthat the brain does exhibit non-linear criticality during flow (Weber \net al., 2018 ). It may be that the null metastability results observed in \n(Huskey et al., 2021) was driven by the limited temporal resolution of \nfMRI. \nSo far, empirical work shows that the brain is organized into a \nmodular network topology during flow (Huskey et al., 2021) , this to-\npology is energetically efficient (Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ), and ex-\nhibits high levels of flexibility (Huskey et al., 2021) , which is associated \nwith the successful deployment of cognitive control during difficult tasks \n(Cole et al., 2013 ). However, the exact nature of brain-network con-\nnectivity during flow is unresolved, and this connectivity may very well \nexhibit metastable characteristics. \nTherefore, we return to our discussion concerning criticality. Con-\ntrasted with the increase in disorder accompanying the onset of a psy-\nchedelic state, entry into flow appears to require a decrease in \ndisorder —that is, an integration of information —driven by behaviorally \nsalient and cognitively demanding task-oriented input. Thus flow, especially in the motorcycle scenario considered in this paper, is non- \nresting and task-dependent. Additionally, while the edge-of-criticality \naspect of the psychedelic state increases the repertoire of possible \nstates, we predict that entry into flow will constrain the repertoire of \nactive brain states. We also suggest that this will correspond, empiri -\ncally, with an increase in directed, and a decrease in undirected, func-\ntional connectivity. The brain, upon entry into flow, allocates its \nresources vis-ˇa-vis distinct connectivity patterns in a manner required \nfor all the requisite performance-enhancing cognitive processes needed \nfor the task at hand —in this case, a successful swerve. \nMoreover, research has shown that the brain can quickly tune itself \ncloser to or farther away from criticality depending on external input to \nthe specific network (Zierenberg et al., 2018 ). Wilting and Priesemann \n(2019) have called the underlying mechanism driving this process: \n“homeostatic plasticity. ” In homeostatic plasticity, neurons and their \nnetworks use negative feedback loops to maintain a target spike rate, \nthereby stabilizing network dynamics. By adjusting their excitability to \ncompensate for unrestrained neural communication, neurons can \nself-organize into a variety of dynamical regimes. This reorganization \nmoves the brain to a subcritical point, where neural communication is \nwell-constrained. It may be that this same subcritical point is where the \nflow network manifests and operates. \nGiven this scenario, it is also important to note that both “neural \ncontext ” and “situational context ” are likely to play central roles in \ndetermining exact changes in brain dynamics during flow. Neural \ncontext refers to the specific selective functioning of local neural pro-\ncesses as they are modulated by global neural influences, as distin -\nguished from situational context, which involves both internal \ninformation from the periphery and external information from the \nenvironment, as well as the behavioral demands this information places \nupon the brain and body (Bressler and McIntosh, 2007 ). While the \nrelationship between these two categories of context is not completely \nunderstood, the research clearly shows situational context shapes neural \ncontext —meaning context dependent, task-relevant cues constrain brain \nconnectivity. This dependent relationship likely increases pattern \nrecognition and cognitive flexibility, while decreasing (or constraining) \nthe possible states the relevant networks can operate within (Weber and \nFisher, 2020 ). In other words, in flow, situational context likely in-\nfluences the sub-critical set point toward which homeostatic plasticity \ntunes the brain in order to maximize cognitive flexibility and minimize \nprediction errors. \nIn flow, the above mechanism would allow the brain to constrain the \npossible task-specific parameter space between connections of selected \ncortical areas, but loosen them in other areas, allowing for the unique \ncreativity that is commonly associated with flow. The specific changes in \nboth directed and undirected functional connectivity hypothesized here \nmake it possible for the brain to increase pattern recognition and \ncognitive flexibility, but within a specific context. Recent evidence from \nKonovalov and Krajbich (2018) supports this, as they found the brain \nengages in a novel form of pattern learning. Using a Bayesian \npattern-learning inference model, they found that brain networks both \npredict patterns, while simultaneously developing rules that increase the \nfinding of future patterns. Thus, we surmise here that contextual pro-\ncessing constrains creativity in a flow state, essentially creating a highly \nconstrained novelty detection system that is specifically tuned to in-\ncrease task-specific performance and learning. \nAs applied to our hypothetical situation, during flow, and due to \nhomeostatic plasticity, the motorcyclist ’s brain is much closer to the \nedge-of-criticality inside a context-constrained search space. This allows \nthe rider to find all possible best action-plans for swerving around that \noffending car, but saves the brain from cue-dependent yet task- \nirrelevant association —which is something that happens in other \naltered states, such as dreaming or psychedelic states. \nFinally, from a computational perspective, the above analysis sug-\ngests that a modelling approach may be useful for exploring flow, given \nthat it is very difficult to study this cognitive phenomenon in an S.

A sufficient model used to simulate the network \nconditions, as well as the environmental stimulus, may yield more \ndescription, explanation and prediction for the onset of the state (see e. \ng., Bensaid et al., 2019 ). Melnikoff and colleagues (2022) , using the \nconcept of mutual information, recently proposed and empirically \nvalidated a computational theory of the subjective experience of flow. \nThis model is based on the concept of Bayesian surprise, which we \nbelieve directly corresponds with our proposed involvement of the \nP300b surprise signal. Likewise, Itti and Baldi (2009) found that this \nkind of surprise (like our motorcyclist scenario) attracts visual-spatial \nattention. We suggest that integrating this phenomenological model \nwith some of the underlying neural mechanism described here, would be \na reasonable future step. \nOne interesting element of Melnikoff et al’s (2022) model is that it \ndirectly contradicts one of the core causal antecedents of flow; that is, \nthe challenge/skill balance. This model shows empirically that flow can \noccur, even when the challenge/skill balance is low. Such a finding is \nnovel given that the challenge/skill balance is the most common in-\nduction in experimental flow research (see e.g., Huskey et al., 2018b,a, \n2021 ; Keller and Bless, 2008 ; Keller and Blomann, 2008 ; Ulrich et al., \n2014, 2016a,b, 2018, 2022 ). However, the challenge/skill balance has \ncome under some recent scrutiny as recent experimental work has failed \nto detect a difference between self-reported flow when challenge ≪skill \n(flow) or when challenge Dskill (Huskey et al., 2021) . Therefore, it will \nbecome increasingly important to further verify the extent to which \nmutual information, rather than the challenge/skill balance, explains \nwhen and why flow occurs. Early tests of this mutual information model \nhave been conducted in behavioral contexts (Melnikoff et al., 2022 ) but \ncould be extended into neuroscientific contexts using existing datasets \n(e.g., Huskey et al., 2021 ). If it turns out that mutual information (and \nBayesian surprise more generally) do offer a causal explanation for flow, \nthen it becomes possible to link this mechanism with existing neuro -\nscientific research (e.g., Nour et al., 2018 ; O’Reilly et al., 2013 ; \nSchwartenbeck et al., 2016 ). \n4.Linking neurobiology with phenomenology \nAt the start of this paper, we described criteria any robust explana -\ntion of flow-onset should meet, specifically it needs to explain the six \ncore characteristics of flow, the functionality of the state ’s triggers, and \nthe state ’s well-documented impact on performance. Does this expla -\nnation satisfy these requirements? To answer this question, we revisit \nthe six core phenomenological characteristics of flow and explore this \nproposal ’s ability to account for all six. \n4.1. Complete concentration \nAs discussed, flow is a state of complete concentration, but how this \nconcentration arises has yet to be determined. If we assume an error \nsignal (ERP) at the onset of flow, then the resulting activity in the \nsalience network and the NE-induced amplification of attention could \nserve as the gateway into complete concentration. Similarly, recent \ncomputational modeling work (Fromer et al., 2021; Grahek et al., 2022 ) \nshows that early prediction errors inform people about task efficacy and \nthe expected value of reward associated with effort. When efficacy or \nexpected reward value is low, people allocate less effort compared to \nwhen efficacy and reward are high. Considering that flow is a highly \nrewarding psychological state that requires high levels of efficacy, it is \nlikely that these early prediction error signals influence subsequent \ncontrol deployment. Furthermore, it is likely that phasic DA release \nhelps sustain that focus over time. \n4.2. Merger of action and awareness \nThe merger of action and awareness is less empirically tractable, but \nlikely correlates with the efficiency of motor activity. In our motorcycle example, if the swerve had been highly efficacious (as would be likely \nduring flow), then we would see increased neuronal activation in the \ncorresponding motor areas than would be present in novice, or other -\nwise low-efficacy swervers. Some preliminary evidence points in this \ndirection. Flow is associated with increased activity in sensorimotor \ncortex and the cerebellum (which is often implicated in fine-motor co-\nordination) compared to conditions of low-difficulty (Huskey et al., \n2018 ). Interestingly, however, the brain-network topology associated \nwith this activation is more sparsely connected (a measure of energetic \nefficiency) during flow relative to a low-difficulty condition (Huskey \net al., 2018 ). Research shows that, for well-rehearsed tasks, more effi-\ncient brain-network topologies are associated with increased perfor -\nmance (Bassett et al., 2009 ). Upregulation in sensorimotor cortex and \ncerebellum, combined with an efficient brain-network topology, might \nbe a neural signature of the merger of action and awareness associated \nwith flow. Indeed, the functionality of the challenge-skills balance as a \nflow trigger implies expertise and the presence of pre-existing motor \nplans and/or knowledge structures that expertise demands. \n4.3. Time Perception \nAs discussed, time dilation can be produced by a number of different \nmechanisms. Phasic DA signaling speeds up and/or slows down our \nperception of time, as does an increase in signaling in the salience \nnetwork. Additionally, Dietrich and others have argued that temporal \nintegration is a prefrontal function and that time dilation would be a \nbyproduct of transient hypofrontality (2004). This presents a conun -\ndrum as research syntheses (Coull et al., 2011 ) and meta-analytic work \n(Wiener et al., 2010 ) show that accurate time perception requires a \ndistributed network of activation across prefrontal (inferior frontal \ngyrus, precentral gyrus, supplemental motor area) and basal ganglia \nstructures (anterior putamen, caudate nucleus), regions which have all \nbeen implicated in flow (see e.g., Huskey, Craighead et al., 2018 ; Klasen \net al., 2011; Ulrich et al., 2014 , 2016). If these regions are all required \nfor accurate time perception, and these regions also show increased \nactivity during flow, then the largescale hypofrontality hypothesis pro-\nposed by Dietrich (2004) is not well supported. \nA narrower interpretation of Dietrich ’s (2004) hypothesis may pro-\nvide an answer. Many of the structures listed above are implicated in \n“explicit ” (how long a stimulus lasts, or the interstimulus interval) or \n“implicit ” (using temporal information to achieve specific task goals) \ntiming (Coull et al., 2011 ). Both types of time perception may be crucial \nfor accomplishing challenging tasks that are associated with the flow \nexperience. However, there is evidence of localized hypofrontality, \nparticularly in the mPFC, during flow. The mPFC is a core structure in \nthe DMN, and a consistent body of research shows that the mPFC and \nDMN are downregulated during flow (see e.g., Huskey, Craighead et al., \n2018 ; Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ; Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a,b, 2022 ). \nThe DMN is also implicated in conscious awareness of time ’s passing \n(Lloyd, 2012 ). Therefore, it could be that just mPFC deactivation (as \nproposed by Dietrich, 2004 ), but not a large scale downregulation of the \nDMN, explains temporal dilation during flow. \nSo far, we have discussed time ’s passage during flow in terms of \ndilation. However, research suggests that, in some cases of flow, the \nperception of time speeds up. Keller and Bless (2008) found subjects \nreported time went by faster while experiencing flow playing a video \ngame. Additionally, Rutrecht et al. (2021) , obtained a similar result in a \nvirtual reality game scenario. Others have found that a perception of \ntime passing rapidly is associated with increased levels of flow and task \nperformance (Christandl et al., 2018 ). Indeed, ample evidence suggests \nthat time often passes rapidly during flow (for a review see Barthelm as \nand Keller, 2021 ). \nRegrettably, this ambiguity between time dilation and the speeded \nexperience of time is prevalent in the flow literature. For instance, \nprominent self-report measures of flow, including the DFS-2 and FFS-2 \n(Jackson and Eklund, 2004 ) fail to distinguish between the two. Even S. Kotler et al."

At the \nsame time, there is some evidence (Heim, 1892 , Eagleman, 2009 , Kotler, \n2013 ) that time dilation is more frequently reported in high-risk situa-\ntions than time acceleration. Therefore, the nature of time perception, \nand its neural substrates during flow, remains an open question. \n4.4. The Vanishing of Self \nDietrich and others have correlated the diminishment of our sense of \nself to transient and localized mPFC hypofrontality (Dietrich, 2004 ). \nThis also tracks with research by Kotler & Murphy (forthcoming) \nshowing that subjects report time dilation before they report the van-\nishing of self. If time is first dilated by activity in the salience network \nand the increase and/or decline in phasic DA (non-hypofrontal mecha -\nnisms) and the vanishing of self is a result of localized mPFC hypo -\nfrontality, this mechanism could match the reported evidence. \nResearch shows a consistent downregulation of the DMN during flow \n(see e.g., Huskey, Craighead et al., 2018 ; Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ; \nUlrich et al., 2014, 2016a,b, 2022 ). In addition to temporal perception, \nthe DMN is heavily implicated in self-referential processing (for a \nmeta-analysis, see Northoff et al., 2006 ). It could very well be that this \nDMN downregulation explains the diminished self-awareness that is \ncommonly experienced during flow. Additionally, Klasen et al. (2012) \nfound deactivation in the temporal parietal junction during a study of \nflow in video gamers. As described above, the TPJ has been implicated in \nboth embodied and disembodied (out of body) experiences (Blanke and \nArzy, 2005 ) and could play an additional role in the diminishment of our \nsense of self. \n4.5. A sense of control \nA sense of control could be produced by either phasic DA increases \nand/or a series of P300 ERPs —as both reflect better than expected re-\nsults from task execution. As DA also increases pattern recognition and \namplifies muscle reaction times, these performance benefits could \nfurther contribute to the phenomenological experience of control. \nIndeed, error signals associated with reward and self-efficacy guide the \ndeployment of control (Fromer et al., 2021; Grahek et al., 2022 ). \nMoreover, the FPCN, a core network in control deployment, is both \nflexible and modular during flow (Huskey et al., 2021 ). This flexibility is \nassociated with successful control deployment during difficult tasks \n(Cole et al., 2013 ), and modularity is associated with energetic effi-\nciency (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012 ) and increased task performance \n(Bassett, 2009 ). Finally, as the dACC aids in action plan selection and \nremote action plan detection —two neuronal activities that, at least hy-\npothetically, should impact our phenomenological sense of control —it is \nfurther likely that the dACC activity proposed in this paper would \nfurther correspond to that sense of control. \n4.6. Autotelicity \nIn this scenario, autotelicity can be produced by the significant in-\ncrease in dopaminergic signaling described in T 3 and T 7. In their \nexcellent overview of the neurobiology of intrinsic motivation, Di \nDomenico and Ryan (2017) argue that heightened activity in \nsalience-coding DA neurons accounts for the amplified intrinsic moti-\nvation of the autotelic experience. This idea receives further support \nfrom both de Manzano et al. (2013) and Gyurkovics et al. (2016) who \nboth found empirical evidence linking DA activity to the autotelic nature \nof flow. Furthermore, studies consistently associate heightened intrinsic \nmotivation with increased activity in the salience network and the ex-\necutive attention network and decreased activity in the default mode \nnetwork (for complete review, see Di Domenico and Ryan, 2017 ). This is \nfurther bolstered by evidence showing that flow is associated with increased activity within, and functional connectivity between reward \nprocessing regions (Huskey et al., 2018b,a, 2021; Klasen et al., 2012 ; \nUlrich et al., 2014, 2016a ). \nIn animal models, acute stress releases dynorphin into the NAcc \nwhich downregulates DA and has been correlated with learned help-\nlessness and depressive symptoms (Kram et al., 2002 ). This may explain \nthe division between flow and trauma, as this would occur in the trauma \nscenario, while the flow scenario seems likely to require enkephalin \nrelease (which is associatd with feelings of euphoria, see Boecker et al., \n2008 ). As applied to our motorcycle hypothetical situation, once the \nswerve produces better than expected results, enkephalins would be \nreleased. These chemicals both increase DA production (Kalivas and \nDuffy, 1990 ), which would further enhance motivation and increase \nautotelicity. Finally, work by Henry et al. (2017) relates heightened \nenkephalin signaling to the development of resilience, suggesting an \nopioid-related mechanism for the post-traumatic growth we see in the \nflow-condition motorcyclist. \n4.7. Flow triggers and performance benefits \nThe neuronal processes outlined in this paper offer a potential \nexplanation of both flow ’s triggers and flow ’s performance benefits. We \nagain emphasize that more research is needed for demonstrating the \ncausal role of the triggers and their relationship with performance. On \nthe trigger side, clear goals, immediate feedback, the challenge-skills \nbalance, novelty, complexity, unpredictability, risk, insight, curiosity, \npassion, autonomy, mastery and purpose, all engage the seeking system \nand activate phasic DA release. It is likely that any sudden change in DA \nsignaling and activity in the salience network —triggered either exter -\nnally or internally —can (but will not always) result in flow. Moreover, \nand as discussed elsewhere, it seems these reward signals appear to bias \nthe deployment of control, which should further facilitate task perfor -\nmance. Now, from a descriptive perspective, flow ’s triggers engage \nmultiple systems and processes, and thus the proposal in this paper \ndescribes how global neurocognitive changes in the brain are associated \nwith those triggers. \nOn the performance side, the significant increase in salience network \nactivity, especially the LC-NE system, coupled to an increase in dopa-\nminergic signaling could account for flow ’s heightening of both intrinsic \nmotivation and learning rates (Pekrun, 1992; Seli et al., 2016; Tyng \net al., 2017 ). This increase in DA signaling could also partially explain \nflow ’s impact on creativity and innovation, as DA also amplifies pattern \nrecognition. Additionally, as DA signaling correlates with an increase in \npositive affect and positive affect has been shown to increase the like-\nlihood that the dACC will discover remote associations and activate \nweakly recalled action plans, this could be a further mechanism for \nenhanced creativity (Kounios et al., 2006; Kounios and Jung-Beeman, \n2014 ). Myers et al. (2016) found that grit correlated with ventral \nstriatal networks extending to the mPFC and rostral ACC, while Tour-\noutoglou et al. (2018) discovered that the ACC is the central hub for \ntenacity-persistence in the face of challenges. Both of these systems \nwould be active in a flow scenario and could account for the downstream \ndevelopment of grit and resilience that has been correlated with \npost-traumatic growth. Moreover, recent neuroimaging studies on grit in \nacademic performance link the trait to heightened spontaneous resting \nstate activity in the right dlPFC (Wang et al., 2017 ). This finding cor-\nresponds to research by Nakagawa et al. (2016) , who state: “The dlPFC \nseems to be the main neural correlate of post-traumatic growth. ” \n5.The flow versus trauma question \nIn our hypothetical example, why does one motorcyclist experience \nflow and another traumatic stress? Before we explore alterations in \nunderlying neurobiological mechanisms that account for this difference \nin psychological outcome, an examination of the similarities between \nexperiences is worth considering. Both flow and traumatic stress are S. Kotler et al."

Yet, it is within the actions of those neuro -\nmodulatory systems that we can start this discussion. \nOne of the larger neurobiological differences between flow and \ntrauma involves phasic DA. As reviewed earlier, in flow, there is an in-\ncrease in phasic DA signaling that results from both the “fight response ” \nand/or the successful execution of the initial “swerve ” motor-action \nplan. This surge does not occur in trauma, because, while the execu -\ntion of the same “swerve ” motor-action occurs, in the trauma-scenarios \nit is a fear-inducing stimulus. More specifically, rebound-excitation \ntheory (J.C. Lee et al., 2016; E.M. Lee et al., 2016 ) proposes that DA \nneurons rebound —that is, reactivate phasic DA signaling —at the \ntermination of fearful experiences, putting a “brake ” on fear-excitation \nby supplying intrinsic safety signals. This increase in phasic DA also \nexplains why our flow-condition motorcyclist does not have fearful \nmemories, as the amygdala-connected, ECS-modulated, DA neurons in \nthe mPFC, via connections to the amygdala, play a crucial role in sup-\npressing hyperarousal and promoting fear extinction (Milad et al., 2009; \nFenster et al., 2018 ). \nConcurrent to this flow-condition increase in DA signaling, activity \nin the endocannabinoid system is likely to further down-regulate the \namygdala, thus promoting fear-extinction while reducing responses to \nconditioned fear cues and the retrieval of fearful memories (Atsak et al., \n2012 , Bitencourt et al., 2008 ). This would not happen in our trauma \ncondition, which helps explain why PTSD sufferers show heightened \nactivity in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex reflecting \nover-expression of this network and the experience of “hyper-vigilance ” \n(Szeszko and Yehuda, 2019 ). \nAdditionally, work by Jasnow et al. (2013) shows that \nfear-extinction is a less robust process than fear-creation. In this process, \ninputs from the vmPFC and hippocampus activate when there is safety \nlearning after fearful exposure (Hartley and Phelps, 2010 ), something \nthat is likely to occur in our flow condition. The opposite is true for \ntrauma, as reduced activation of the vmPFC heightens fearful responses \nand the creation of fear-based memories (Jovanovic et al., 2012 ). \n6.Summary \nThe ideas presented herein suggest that there is a cortico-striatal- \nthalamic loop that governs the onset of flow. We have also proposed \nthat the basal ganglia, thalamus, amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate \ncortex are involved. Activity in this loop is modulated by a combination \nof endocannabinoid, dopaminergic and noradrenergic signaling. More -\nover, this hypothesis suggests that loop activation is downstream from \nthe fight response and the arrival of a series of P300 waves or, at the very \nleast, an increase of phasic DA in the VTA. More broadly, a “flow \nnetwork ” is beginning to emerge where signals from the FPCN and \nreward structures are integrated (see also, Weber et al., 2009 ). In fact, \nand as argued earlier, it appears that the salience network facilitates the \ntransition into the flow network (for an extended treatment, see Weber \nand Fisher, 2020 ). \nOverall, our exploration of a neurobiological account for the onset of \nflow includes various perspectives, including both neuroscientific and \nphenomenological ones. We believe that, by incorporating this account \ninto a broader framework with other cognitive states —i.e., PTSD and the \npsychedelic state —we gain a deeper insight into the neurocognitive \nprocesses associated with flow. \n6.1. Open questions, future directions and research initiatives \nWhile flow ’s considerable impact on performance is widely docu-\nmented, these effects are rarely accounted for in the neurobiological \ndescriptions of the state. Yet any theoretical overview of flow should \ninclude the state ’s impact on cognitive performance, with specific \nattention paid to its impact on the following categories: (a) creativity, improvisation and innovation (Amabile et al., 2005; Csikszentmihalyi, \n1997; Doyle, 2017 ), (b) learning and education (Rathunde and Csiks -\nzentmihalyi, 2005 ; Berka et al., 2007 ; Craig et al., 2004 ), (c) motivation \nand productivity (Bryce and Haworth, 2002 ; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ; \nRheinberg and Engeser, 2018 ), (d) cooperation and collaboration \n(Sawyer, 2015 ; Shehata et al., 2020 ; van den Hout et al., 2018 ), (e) \nwell-being, meaning, purpose and eudaimonic values (Bonaiuto et al., \n2016 ; Seligman et al., 2007 ; Csikszentmihalyi and Nakamura, 2014 ), (f) \nappreciation for nature/environmental awareness (Bonaiuto, 2016 ; \nanecdotally, also see Kotler, 2006, 2013 ), (g) empathy (Bachen et al., \n2016; Mesurado et al., 2016 ; Vaillant, 2008 ), (h) grit, perseverance, and \nburnout (Aust et al., 2022; Constantinescu et al., 2017 ; Salanova, 2006 ; \nVon Culin et al., 2014 ; Amabile and Kramer, 2007 ), (i) intuition (Bolte \net al., 2003; Doyle, 2017 ; Jarvilehto, 2016 , see “Intuition and Flow ” in \nFlow Experience), and (j) perception (Sinnett et al., 2020 ). \nThe theoretical model for the transition into flow outlined in this \npaper is unique in the literature as it lays out a neurobiologically plau-\nsible explanation for the flow ’s onset thereby offering predictive insights \nand testable hypotheses — specifically, a set of neuro-markers that may \nbe associated with flow onset and/or flow itself. First, this model pre-\ndicts that flow comprises a unique pattern of brain network activation, \ndistinct from other similar states of consciousness, e.g., hyperfocus, \npsychedelic states, and deep meditative states. If this is correct, then \nflow can be characterized as a phenomenologically distinct experience. \nSecond, although current neuroimaging methods may not be able to \nascertain whether some of these neurobiological mechanisms are at \nwork during the transition into flow (particularly as described in our \nhypothetical situation), future technological advances (e.g., wearable \nfunctional near-infrared spectroscopy [FNIRS] or EEG devices) may \nfacilitate the discovery of these mechanisms. Third, and perhaps most \nimportantly, if contrasting neurobiological outcomes distinguish flow \nfrom traumatic stress, this would be particularly important as flow could \nbe used as a possible therapeutic approach to PTSD, and resilience more \nbroadly (see Tabibnia, 2020 ). As initial evidence pointing in this di-\nrection, research shows that increased cognitive control (which flow \nseems to require) is associated with decreased PTSD symptoms (White \net al., 2018 ). \nAt the same time, there are several important questions that shape \ninquiry into the neural basis of flow. For instance, we have outlined \nnumerous flow triggers that are thought to causally elicit the flow \nexperience. Excluding the challenge/skill balance, the evidence for \nnearly all of these triggers is correlational. Therefore, the causal role of \nthese triggers remains uncertain. Similarly, we cannot identify a single \nstudy that systematically manipulates all triggers to identify if all are \nsimultaneously necessary to elicit flow. Said differently, the necessary \nand sufficient conditions that elicit flow require further investigation. \nSimilarly, we consider the phenomenological characteristics of what \nit is like to be in flow (complete concentration, merger of action and \nawareness, time dilation, the vanishing self, a sense of control, autote -\nlicity). Csikszentmihalyi (1990) has argued that all six characteristics \ndescribe the flow experience. Here again, the evidence for these char-\nacteristics is largely correlational, and based on retrospective-self report \nmeasures. There is a dire need to systematically, and experimentally, \nconfirm the presence of all six characteristics during flow. \nOne challenge is that this confirmation will largely rely on \ncomparing self-reported measures for these six phenomenological \ncharacteristics, in a flow condition relative to non-flow conditions. Such \nan approach makes it possible to claim that a flow condition elicits more \nself-reported flow than a non-flow condition (for examples, see e.g., \nHuskey et al., 2018b,a, 2021 ; Keller and Bless, 2008 ; Ulrich et al., 2014, \n2016a,b, 2018, 2022 ). Defining flow in comparison to non-flow is use-\nful, but comes with its own challenges. How much self-reported flow is \nrequired to say that someone is truly experiencing flow? Surely the score \nshould be above the scale mid-point. But by how much? And by how \nmuch on each of flow ’s six phenomenological characteristics? Are all six \ncharacteristics always present during flow? Right now, we do not have S. Kotler et al."

This is especially true when we consider that most \nneuroscientific methods for linking neural response with psychology or \nphenomenology are correlational in nature (Ramsey et al., 2010 ). When \nconsidered in conjunction with concerns about reverse inference (Pol-\ndrack, 2006 ), it seems unlikely that neuroscientific investigation will \noffer clear solutions to these problems.
