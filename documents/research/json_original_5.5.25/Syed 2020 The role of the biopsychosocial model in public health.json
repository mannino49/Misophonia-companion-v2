Engel employed his multifaceted and critical thinking in 1977 to develop the bio-psychosocial \nmodel. It was pivotal to just not psychology but to health, medicine and human development as well. The \nbio-psychosocial model scrutinised how biology, psychology and socio -environmental factors play a role in \nhealth. George L. Engel along  with Jon Romano of Rochester University proposed a more holistic approach \nto frame this model for illness and psychological problems both. The authors pointed out that the new \napproach will be responsible for the re -education of the people with “problem o f living”.  \nThe diseases were seen with the lens of biomedical models having molecular biology as its pillar. The \nbiomedical model assumed that each occurrence of the disease was a result of deviation of biological \nmolecules inside the body. It excluded the  importance of social, psychological and behavioural dimensions \nof the illnesses and forced the health care workers to analyse the behavioural aberrations as a result of \nabnormal biochemical or neuro -physiological processes. It also amalgamated reductionis m and mind -body \ndualism [1].  \nReview  \nIn the society, people have different perceptions of health. The general perception of the health is the \nabsence of any objective signs or symptoms of the disease relating to improper functioning of the body, \nlike pain or distress. This cannot be shared as  an ideology amongst health care givers. It is not merely the \nabsence of any disease which defines health rather it is a dynamic process of well -being. An individual’s \nwell-being is largely determined by his/her psychological state and social harmony. Psyc hological trauma \nplays a significant role in the development of mental illnesses. Post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a \ncharacteristic clinical picture resulting from psychological trauma. It is found that people experiencing \nstressful life has more f requent symptoms of PTSD [2]. It is thus worthwhile to note the importance of \npsychosocial factors in the development of an illness.       \nGeorge L. Engel quoted “We are now faced with the necessity and the challenge to broaden the approach \nto disease to i nclude the psychosocial without sacrificing the enormous advantages of the biomedical \napproach” [1, 3]. This is a more realistic approach as lifestyle factors play a significant role since the \nsociety has entered the new millennium. The author mentioned in  his article that psychological, social and \nbiological factors were in play in the development of disease in all strata of societies; ancient or modern, \npre-literate or literate. To determine whether a person is sick, the author mentioned, the verbal and \nbehavioural demonstration of an individual are the first to be noticed to make a judgement [1]. \nThe biomedical model puts forth a view that a person who is feeling sick but has normal laboratory \nfindings is healthy and a person feeling well having abnormal laboratory findings is unhealthy. This \ndiscrepancy can never be explained with the biomedical model of the disease. The bio -psychosocial model"

It can be understood by \nan example of a man acquiring diabetes at the age of 40 years. The \nclinical manifestation of the disease might  have presented at the age of \n40 years but the pathological processes already started at earlier stage \nbecause of stress and poor eating habits of excess carbohydrates and \nrefined foods, which lead to insulin resistance and which ultimately \nresulted in the  apparent disease [4]. It takes a long time for insulin \nresistance to manifest as diabetes, which is a result of chronic stress \nand prolong unhealthy behaviour. Patient with diabetes requires a \nholistic approach for their treatment. Such patients are requi red to \naddress all of the factors responsible for the development of disease \nand not just one. It will be futile to only correct his blood glucose levels \nby a medicine and not thinking about the major contributing factors at \nall.   \nThe bio -psychosocial mod el helps a health care giver to understand \nbetter the role of various factors responsible for the development of \nthe disease and provide more comprehensive preventative information \nto the patients in the society about how they should adjust their \nlifestyle s to have a better quality of life. The diseases of modern age \nlike coronary heart disease and cancers are associated with established \npsychological and social components to their causation. The \npsychological factors such as high self -esteem and perceived control of \nlife have been attributed to many health promoting behaviours like \nexercise, balanced diet, avoiding excess alcohol and avoiding smoking. \nAll of them prevent having coronary heart disease [3]. Tobacco use is \nan established cause of cancer which relies heavily on behavioural and \npsychological aspects of a person. Similarly, gastrointestinal cancers \nhave been found to have dietary factors associated with them [5].  \nThe role of burden of stress i n the development of diseases is well \nknown. Many individuals are faced with various environmental, social \nand psychological demands which exceed their ability to cope. Such \nindividuals ultimately produce adverse physiological changes in the \nbody and thus are responsible for the disease outcome [6]. It implies \nthat a patient should never be only looked at as a diseased body. The \npsychological and social factors should always be included for a proper \nintervention. It is necessary to address the beliefs, perc eption and \nattributes of an individual about their health and illness. It would have \nbeen difficult to accomplish a holistic approach to increase the status \nof the society had we been considering biomedical models alone.   \nConsideration of social factors i s deemed necessary to address an \nillness. Factors such as loneliness, lack of social participation, the \neffects of unemployment  are all related to poor health outcomes [3]. \nIt will help to address the public health agencies to intervene in \npoverty, unempl oyment and loneliness in society through proper \nchannels. It is a revolutionary approach. The public health agencies will \nbe able to provide enormous data associated with these adverse social \nconditions to the government to implement changes at political l evel. \nIn an article by Buckner et al  in 2013, the authors mentioned that the \nrelationship between substance use disorder and social anxiety \ndisorder could be very well explained using the bio -psychosocial \nmodel. The authors explained that socially anxious individuals manage \ntheir unpleasant affective states by using substances thereby \nincreasing positive affect and avoiding social scrutiny [7]. Social anxiety \nis also related to tobacco smoking and nicotine dependence and thus it \nis important to address subs tance -use behaviours in people with social \nanxiety. It is also imperative to find the reason behind the substance \nuse or else all efforts to treat a person will go in vain.   \nThe general practitioners and hospital doctors should be able to accept \nthe role of psychological techniques to address the issues related to \nillnesses. The psychological, social and biological aspects of a disease \nare inseparable and should be seen together. It is beneficial to train \nnew doctors and health care givers keeping the fund amental teachings \nof the bio -psychosocial model. Such trained healthcare givers will be able to see a patient effectively and be able to divide their resources \nefficiently. All of this will lead to better outcomes for public health.  \nIn a study conducted by  Alonso in 2004, the author pointed out that \nphysicians were reluctant to incorporate the bio -psychosocial model \nand were more focussing on traditional methods for treating the \npatients [8]. On the contrary, there are studies which showed adoption \nof the b io-psychosocial model in the treatment of schizophrenia [9], \nchronic fatigue [10], antisocial behaviour [11], gastrointestinal illnesses \n[12], spinal cord injury [13] and pain management [14]. It is also \nessential to understand that this model is not only concerned with the \ncuring of the lesion, but also helping an ailing patient to regain his \nnormal life activities. A study done by Ashar et al  in 2007 showed that \nneural pathways which were associated with pain detection and those \nthat link pain with negati ve emotions became relatively less active \nafter having a prior knowledge about the success of a medical \nintervention [15]. \nAlthough, the agents causing an illness are mainly biological, \npsychological and social, the individual should be centred while \ntreat ing the disease and thus he or she is responsible for their \ntreatment. For example, taking medication, changing lifestyle and \navoiding unhealthy food items are responsibility of the individual. \nHealth and illness exist on a continuum and the person progres ses \nalong this continuum. In contrast to this, the biomedical model states \nthat individuals are regarded as victims of some external agents \ncausing unhealthy internal changes and these individuals are not seen \nresponsible for their own health. The onus lie s on the treating \nphysician himself, and health and illness are seen qualitatively different \nfrom each other. The biomedical model also wrongly states that the \nillness may have psychological consequences, but not psychological \nagents. For example, cancer m ay lead to sadness and depression and \nnot the vice versa.  \nThe bio -psychosocial model guides the availability of medical wisdom \nfor the benefit of each patient individually which leads to improved \nsatisfaction and better adherence to the treatment plan. This applies to \nany disease in the society and with improved health outcomes of \neveryone we can uplift the health status of the society. It is easier to \nreduce unnecessary utilisation of available resources and strengthen \nthe efficiency of the health care framework in the society by using the \nbio-psychosocial model.  Public health agencies can use this model to \npredict various outcomes of psychological and social factors into \npreventing appropriate preventative and intervention strategies. It \nleads to significant understanding of mental health difficulties and \nhelps i n the development of application of psychological support for \nmentally ill.    \nThere have been critical views of the bio -psychosocial models. Experts \nstate that it is time consuming and expensive to apply. It lacks the \ntheoretical basis and the evidence to  support it is not many. It was also \nsuggested that it is difficult to gauge which factor is more responsible \nfor the outcome of disease and thus lead to an unequal measure for \nthe treatment. There are many poorly equipped countries with lack of \nadequate r esources to implement such a model. Also, there is a lack of \nstraightforward guidelines to treat a disease, under this model, in \nclinical practice. There are authors who have put an objection on this \nmodel and called it “vague”. The authors proposed that p redictions \ncannot be measured or tested to evaluate this model [16]. Also, it was \nmentioned that it represents an inefficient and time -consuming \nprocess which cannot be applied for individual patients on a daily basis. \nFrom the perspective of a health psyc hologist, the dynamic swaying \nbetween health and illness has multi -factorial causes. It is naïve to \nattribute the psychological and social causes alone for the causation of \ndisease [17].   \nNonetheless, the incorporation of the bio -psychosocial model in pub lic \nhealth leads to ideal practice of modern medicine. It leads to better \nand improved patient care, compliance and satisfaction. The fact that"

Leading causes of death i.e. \nheart diseases, stroke a nd chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are \nall preventable through lifestyle choices [18]. It challenges and \ndemands us to shift our outlook of the diseases in the current times. \nWe are failing as healthcare givers if we are ignoring the impact of the \nmost crucial aspect of psychological and social factors on our health.  \nWe need to accept the issues such as multi -morbidity and we need to \nintegrate patient -oriented and recovery -oriented care into the current \nmedical practices [19]. A better part of any p rescription should include \nbehavioural components like weight loss, smoking cessation and \nregular exercises to reduce the risk.  \nCONCLUSION  \nThe bio -psychosocial model has indeed revolutionised the way the \nhealth care sector approaches a patient of the 21st century and has \nbeen hugely successful in cutting short the gap between actual health \nand a sense of being healthy. The bio -psychosocial model is a strong \nmodel that draws heavy attention on the person as whole rather on \nthe illness alone. It has generate d a new perception to see the health \nof the population. It has broadened the horizon of public health \nagencies to see and examine the illness with a different approach and \nto provide better results in the preventative approaches.  \nREFERENCES  \n1.
