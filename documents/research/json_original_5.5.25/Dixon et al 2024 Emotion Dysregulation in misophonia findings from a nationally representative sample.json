      "text": "Emotion dysregulation in misophonia: Findings from a nationally \nrepresentative sample\nLaura J. Dixon*, Carey J. Sevier , Alexandra M. Freshley\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, United States\nARTICLE INFO\nKeywords:\nEmotion regulation\nMisophonia\nSound sensitivityABSTRACT\nA core feature of misophonia is the emotional distress that occurs in response to specific sounds (e.g., slurping, \npen clicking). Despite the theorized connection between emotion dysregulation and misophonia, there is very \nlittle research on this topic. Examining emotion dysregulation and identifying the specific emotion regulation \ndeficits that are associated with worse misophonia symptoms would advance our understanding of potential \ntransdiagnostic factors central to misophonia symptoms; thereby informing the development of more targeted \ninterventions. The current study sought to: 1) characterize emotion dysregulation among individuals with \nmisophonia, 2) compare emotion dysregulation between individuals with clinical and subclinical misophonia, \nand 3) examine the unique role of emotion dysregulation across three domains of misophonia symptoms. This \nstudy included a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N 4005; 51.5% female; 62.5% White, \nnon-Hispanic). Participants completed self-report questionnaires to assess misophonia symptoms (i.e., miso-\nphonia sounds, emotional and behavioral reactions to misophonia sounds, and misophonia-related impairment), \nstress, and emotion dysregulation. The results revealed participants with misophonia reported significantly \nworse emotion regulation abilities compared to individuals with subclinical levels of misophonia. In addition, \nemotion dysregulation was significantly associated with sensitivity to misophonia sounds, reactions to miso-\nphonia sounds, and misophonia-related impairment, even after accounting for covariates. Results support \nemotion dysregulation as an important element in misophonia and suggest certain dimensions of emotion dys-\nregulation should be considered in future research and in the evaluation of treatment strategies used to reduce \nmisophonia symptoms.\n1.Introduction\nMisophonia is a disorder characterized by reduced tolerance and \nintense negative responses to specific sounds (Swedo et al., 2022 ). \nTrigger sounds can be generated by a variety of sources and include \neating sounds (e.g., slurping), nasal sounds (e.g., sniffing), mouth \nsounds (e.g., coughing), repetitive sounds (e.g., pen clicking), rustling \nsounds (e.g., plastic bags), and environmental sounds (e.g., clock \nticking; Jager et al., 2020 ). Ongoing research suggests visual stimuli (e. \ng., leg swinging, seeing someone eat from across the room) may also \ntrigger reactions in misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jager et al., \n2020 ). Although as many as 27.6 –78.5% of individuals report sensitivity \nto misophonia sounds (Dixon et al., 2024 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ), \npopulation-based studies estimate 2.2–12.8% of adults experience clin-\nical levels of misophonia (Dixon et al., 2024 ; Jakubovski et al., 2022 ; \nKılıç et al., 2021 ). For those with clinical levels of misophonia, severe impairment is observed across life domains including impaired occu-\npational (e.g., difficulties performing work tasks), social (e.g., social \nisolation), and academic functioning (e.g., concentration difficulties; \nRouw and Erfanian, 2018 ). Misophonia has also been shown to have a \nsignificant impact on individuals ’ mental health, with studies showing \nhigh rates of co-occurring psychological disorders (Jager et al., 2020 ; \nRosenthal et al., 2022 ), suicidal thoughts due to misophonia symptoms \n(Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ), and increased risk of self-harm and suici-\ndality (Simner and Rinaldi, 2023 ).\nA key component of misophonia is the intense, negative emotional \nresponse to trigger sounds. More broadly, emotions involve a multidi -\nmensional response that incorporates physiological, expressive, cogni -\ntive, and motivational changes (Levenson, 2014 ), and the dispositional \nmanner in which someone experiences, processes, and responds to this \ninput of information is characterized by the (in)ability to regulate \nemotions.

      "text": "model of emotion regulation emphasizes the awareness and acceptance \nof emotions and the ability to use strategies to engage in goal-directed \nbehaviors and refrain from engaging in impulsive behaviors when \nexperiencing negative emotions. Within misophonia, individuals expe-\nrience a myriad of reactions to trigger sounds, ranging from irritation to \nrage, along with disgust and anxiety (Jager et al., 2020 ; Rouw and \nErfanian, 2018 ), which are accompanied by corresponding behavioral \nexpressions (e.g., verbal aggression, crying, moving away from sounds), \nphysiological symptoms (e.g., muscle tension, increased heart rate, \ntrembling), and cognitive responses (negative thoughts, attention diffi-\nculties, hyperfocus; Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Erfanian et al., 2019 ; Jager \net al., 2020 ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ).\nExtensive research has provided support for emotion dysregulation \nas a transdiagnostic factor affecting the development and maintenance \nof symptoms across psychopathology (Aldao et al., 2010 ; Gratz et al., \n2018 ), as well as contributing to worse outcomes in chronic health \ndisease (Wierenga et al., 2017 ). Moreover, interventions that indirectly \nor directly target emotion dysregulation have been shown to improve \nemotion regulation and clinical outcomes (Gratz et al., 2015 ; Sakiris and \nBerle, 2019 ). Consequently, emotion dysregulation may be critical in \nfurther understanding the clinical presentation of misophonia and \ninforming the development of effective treatments. However, only a few \nstudies to date have investigated emotion dysregulation in relation to \nmisophonia. This research has shown misophonia symptom severity is \npositively associated with general emotion dysregulation in college and \ncommunity-based samples (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta et al., \n2022 ; Kadivarian et al., 2023 ), with one study demonstrating associa -\ntions between misophonia and specific emotion regulation deficits, \nincluding difficulties in engaging in goal-directed behavior, inhibiting \nimpulsive urges and controlling behavior when upset, limited perceived \naccess to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity \n(Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ). In addition, Cassiello-Robbins et al. \n(2020) found difficulties in the ability to control impulsive behaviors \nmediated the relationship between neuroticism and misophonia symp -\ntoms, suggesting this factor of emotion dysregulation may be particu -\nlarly influential in the expression of misophonia symptoms. Building \nupon this work, Guetta et al. (2022) demonstrated a unique association \nbetween emotion dysregulation and misophonia symptoms after con-\ntrolling for mental health symptoms. Altogether, this work documents \npreliminary evidence for a connection between emotion dysregulation \nand misophonia; however, additional research is needed to replicate and \nextend these findings to delineate associations between specific deficits \nin emotion regulation and different types of misophonia symptoms in \nmore representative samples.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate emotion dysregulation in \nmisophonia, and in particular, identify specific deficits that are associ -\nated with worse misophonia symptoms using a large, nationally repre -\nsentative sample of U.S. adults. This research is important for advancing \nour understanding of possible mechanisms underlying misophonia \nsymptoms, which has the potential to inform the development of more \ntargeted interventions for misophonia. The aims of this study were to: 1) \ncharacterize emotion regulation difficulties among individuals with \nclinical levels of misophonia; 2) compare difficulties in emotion regu-\nlation between individuals with clinical and subclinical levels of miso-\nphonia, and 3) examine the unique role of emotion regulation \ndifficulties across three domains of misophonia symptoms, including \nsensitivity to sounds, emotional and behavioral reactions to misophonia \nsounds, and misophonia-related impairment. We hypothesized emotion \ndysregulation would be significantly higher among individuals with \nclinical levels of misophonia compared to those with subclinical symp -\ntoms (i.e., individuals who endorsed sensitivity to misophonia sounds \nbut scored below the clinical threshold). In addition, greater difficulties \nwith emotion regulation were expected to account for unique variance \nin misophonia symptoms, after accounting for covariates.2.Methods and materials\n2.1. Participants and procedures\nThis sample was comprised of 4005 adults aged 18 years and older \nwho completed a survey through Ipsos KnowledgePanel (Knowledge -\nPanel®). KnowledgePanel was used to recruit a large, nationally \nrepresentative sample for a parent study that examined misophonia in \nthe U.S. population (see Dixon et al., 2023 , 2024 for additional infor-\nmation). KnowledgePanel uses address-based sampling methodology to \nselect a truly random sample of adults based on all known households \nidentified by the latest Delivery Sequence File from the U.S. Postal \nService, and geodemographic benchmarks from the latest U.S. Census \nBureau ’s Current Population Survey are used to calculate study-specific \npost-stratification weights, which corrects for potential over- or \nunder-sampling of certain subgroups (Ipsos Public Affairs, n.d.). This \nstudy was approved by the university ’s institutional review board.\nConsistent with the demographics of the U.S. population, 51.5% of \nparticipants were female and 62.5% identified as White, non-Hispanic, \nwith 16.9% identifying as Hispanic; 12.0% Black, Non-Hispanic; 7.2% \nOther, non-Hispanic; and 1.4% multiracial, non-Hispanic. The mean age \nwas 48.32 years (SD 17.76), 56.6% reported they were currently \nmarried, and 62.1% reported having at least some college education (see \nSupplementary Materials).\n2.2. Measures\nStress. The 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4; \nCohen et al., 1983 ) was used to control for recent stress. The PSS-4 as-\nsesses perceived stress (e.g., unable to control important things) in the \npast month. Items are rated on a Likert-type scale from 0 (never) to 4 \n(very often), with higher total scores indicating greater levels of stress. \nPerceived stress was included as a covariate to account for current \ndistress given its association with emotion dysregulation (Gratz et al., \n2018 ), misophonia (Guetta et al., 2024 ), and functional impairment \n(McQuaid et al., 2022 ). The PSS-4 has been demonstrated to have good \nvalidity and reliability (Herrero and Meneses, 2006 ). In this study, in-\nternal reliability was good (α .70).\nEmotion dysregulation. A brief version of the Difficulties in \nEmotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to assess emotion dysregu -\nlation (DERS-16; Bjureberg et al., 2016 ). The DERS-16 reduces partici -\npant burden and demonstrates strong internal reliability, good \ntest-retest reliability, and good convergent and discriminant validity \nthat is consistent with the original DERS (Bjureberg et al., 2016 ; Hallion \net al., 2018 ; Sorman et al., 2022 ). Items are rated on a Likert-type scale \nfrom 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). The DERS-16 includes five \nsubscales that correspond with the DERS, including lack of emotional \nclarity (Clarity), difficulties engaging in goals (Goals), difficulties con-\ntrolling emotions when experiencing distress (Impulse), limited access \nto effective emotion regulation strategies (Strategies), and nonaccep -\ntance of emotional responses (Nonacceptance). The DERS-16 total and \nsubscale scores are computed by summing the relevant items, and higher \nscores indicate greater difficulties regulating emotions. In this study, \ninternal validity was good for the DERS-16 total (α .96) and each of \nthe subscales (αs .85 - .96).\nMisophonia Symptoms. The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu \net al., 2014 ) was used to measure two facets of misophonia symptoms, \nincluding sensitivity to certain sounds (MQ Sounds Scale) and emotional \nand behavioral reactions to misophonia sounds (MQ Emotions and Be-\nhaviors Scale). The MQ Sounds Scale includes seven items assessing the \npresence of specific misophonia sound sensitivities (e.g., people eating) \non a Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (always true). The MQ \nEmotions and Behaviors Scale includes 10 items assessing emotions (e. \ng., anger) and actions (e.g., cover ears) that occur after hearing a trigger \nsound on a Likert-type scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Total scores \nare computed by summing the relevant items for each scale. In this L.J. Dixon et al.

The Work and Social Adjustment \nScale (WSAS; Mundt et al., 2002 ) was used to measure functional \nimpairment due to misophonia across five domains, including ability to \nwork, tasks for the home, social leisure activities, private leisure activ-\nities, and relationships with others. The items are each rated on a \nLikert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 8 (very severely) and summed to \ncreate a total score, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. In \nthis sample, good internal consistency was observed (α .90).\n2.3. Statistical analyses\nData were analyzed using SPSS Version 28.0. KnowledgePanel \nsample weights were applied for all analyses. Data were initially \nscreened, and after accounting for the questionnaire ’s skip logic, find-\nings from Little ’s Missing Completely at Random Test indicated data \nwere missing at random. Mean imputation was used to compute total \nscores where participants responded to ≽75% of items on the scale.\nFirst, descriptive statistics were examined, and zero-order correla -\ntions were computed to explore associations between key study vari-\nables. Next, a series of independent samples t-tests were conducted to \ntest the hypothesis that those with clinical levels of misophonia would \nevidence greater difficulties in emotion regulation than individuals with \nsubclinical misophonia symptoms. Individuals with scores ≽7 on the \nMQ Severity Scale (Wu et al., 2014 ) and ≽10 on the Amsterdam Miso-\nphonia Scale (Schroder et al., 2013 ) were identified as having clinically \nsignificant misophonia symptoms (n 185; see Dixon et al., 2024 ). The \nsubclinical misophonia group was comprised of the remaining in-\ndividuals who endorsed at least some level of sensitivity to one or more \nsounds on the MQ Sounds Scale (n 3490). Given the difference in \nsample sizes, equal variances were not assumed and Hedges ’ g effect \nsizes were calculated.\nNext, a series of three-step hierarchical linear regression analyses \nwere conducted in the full sample to test the hypothesis that greater \nemotion dysregulation would be uniquely associated with misophonia \nsounds (MQ Sounds Scale), emotional and behavioral reactions to \nmisophonia sounds (MQ Emotions and Behavior Scale), and \nmisophonia-related impairment (WSAS), after accounting for relevant \ncovariates. In Step 1, demographic factors were entered, including: age \n(continuous variable), gender (female 0, male 1), race/ethnicity (0 \nindividuals identifying as Black/African American, Non-Hispanic; \nOther, Non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Multiple Races, Non-Hispanic [Persons \nof Color]; 1 White, Non-Hispanic [White]), education (0 high school \nor less; 1 at least some college), marital status (0 not married [never \nmarried, widowed, or divorced/separated]; 1 now married), income \n(0 household income D$75,000, 1 household income ≽$75,000), \nand employment (0 part-time employment or unemployed, 1 \nemployed full time). Race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and \nemployment were dichotomized based on identified social determinants \nfactors known to increase health risk (World Health Organization \n(WHO), n.d.), and income was dichotomized based on median house -\nhold income in the U.S. (Guzman and Kollar, 2023 ). In Step 2, current \nstress (PSS-4) was entered, and facets of emotion regulation difficulties \n(DERS-16 subscales) were entered in Step 3 as the primary variables of \ninterest. Multicollinearity was observed for the DERS-16 Strategies \nsubscale (variance inflation factors [VIFs] F5, tolerance values D0.20) \nwhen all DERS-16 subscales were simultaneously entered in Step 3 of the \nregression analyses. Therefore, Strategies subscale was omitted from the \nmodel. Multicollinearity was not detected in the updated models (VIFs \nD3; tolerance values F0.35). All statistical tests were two-tailed with \nalpha .01.3.Results\n3.1. Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations\nThe means, standard deviations, sample size, ranges, and correla -\ntions for the study variables are provided in Table 1. Positive and sta-\ntistically significant correlations (ps D.001) were observed between all \nstudy variables. The associations between each of the emotion dysre -\ngulation scales and sensitivity to misophonia sounds were small (rs \n.21–.27). Moderate associations were observed for each factor of \nemotion dysregulation and misophonia emotions and behaviors (rs \n.43 - .49) and misophonia-related impairment (rs .41 - .49).\n3.2. Independent samples t-tests\nMeans, standard deviations, independent samples t-test results, and \nHedge ’s g are reported in Table 2. Consistent with hypothesis, partici -\npants with clinical levels of misophonia reported significantly greater \ndifficulties regulating emotions across each dimension, compared to \nthose with subclinical misophonia symptoms. Large effects were \nobserved (Hedge ’s g 1.26 –1.54).\n3.3. Hierarchical regression analyses\nThree hierarchical regression model were conducted to examine \npredictors of misophonia symptoms. The change in R2, unstandardized \ncoefficients, standard errors, and significance level for each model are \nreported in Table 3.\n3.3.1. Misophonia sounds\nWith regard to sensitivity to misophonia sounds, demographic fac-\ntors accounted for 3.8% of the variance in Step 1 (F [7, 3888] 22.09, p \nD.001), and stress contributed 4.8% additional variance in Step 2 (F [8, \n3887] 46.12, p D.001). The emotion dysregulation factors were \nentered in Step 3 and accounted for an additional 3.8% of the variance in \nsensitivity to misophonia sounds (F [12, 3883] 46.07, p D.001), \nindicating a small effect (f2 .04). In the last step, Clarity, Goals, and \nNonacceptance each emerged as significant predictors. The full model \naccounted for 12.5% of the variance in sensitivity to misophonia sounds, \ndemonstrating a small-medium effect (f2 .14).\n3.3.2. Reactions to misophonia sounds\nIn the model predicting emotional and behavioral reactions to \nmisophonia sounds, demographic factors accounted for 6.5% of the \nvariance in Step 1 (F [7, 3594] 35.86, p D.001), and stress contributed \n9.9% additional variance in Step 2 (F [8, 3593] 88.42, p D.001). \nEmotion dysregulation factors were entered in Step 3 and accounted for \nan additional 11.2% of the variance in reactions to misophonia sounds (F \n[12, 3589] 114.48, p D.001), indicating a medium effect (f2 .15). \nAll four emotion dysregulation subscales emerged as significant pre-\ndictors. The full model accounted for 27.7% of the variance in reactions \nto misophonia sounds, demonstrating a large effect (f2 .38).\n3.3.3. Misophonia-related impairment\nIn the model predicting misophonia-related impairment, de-\nmographic factors accounted for 4.1% of the variance in Step 1 (F [7, \n3688] 22.57, p D.001), and stress contributed 12.2% additional \nvariance in Step 2 (F [8, 3687] 89.64, p D.001). Emotion dysregu -\nlation factors were entered in Step 3 and accounted for an additional \n11.9% of the variance in misophonia-related impairment (F [12, 3683] \n120.62, p D.001), indicating a medium effect (f2 .17). The Clarity, \nGoals, and Impulse subscales emerged as significant predictors. The full \nmodel accounted for 28.2% of the variance in impairment, demon -\nstrating a large effect (f2 .39).L.J.

      "text": "4.Discussion\nThis study used a large, nationally representative sample to elucidate \nthe role of emotion dysregulation in misophonia. Two of the prominent \nfindings that emerged were that individuals with clinical levels of \nmisophonia had significantly greater difficulties in emotion regulation \ncompared to those with subclinical symptoms, and emotion dysregula -\ntion was significantly associated with misophonia symptoms – above \nand beyond variance accounted for by demographic factors and current \nstress. These findings and the specific patterns observed across the re-\nsults help inform the conceptualization of misophonia symptoms.\nThe first aim was to characterize emotion regulation difficulties in a \nlarge, diverse sample of adults with clinical levels of misophonia. The \nscores on the DERS-16 in the misophonia sample were similar to means \nreported by community samples of adults reporting emotion dysregu -\nlation (e.g., Bjureberg et al., 2016 ); whereas the subclinical group re-\nported scores consistent with nonclinical, community-based samples (e. \ng., Sorman et al., 2022 ). These findings are not surprising; yet, the \ndescriptive results established by this nationally representative sample \nof adults with clinical and subclinical levels of misophonia provide a \nuseful reference point for understanding levels of emotion regulation \ndifficulties among individuals with misophonia in research and clinical \nsettings. That is, clinicians and researchers who administer the DERS-16 \nor DERS to individuals with misophonia can use the means from this \nstudy to help contextualize the scores on these measures. In particular, \nthis information may be helpful for detecting strengths or weaknesses in \nemotion regulation abilities and comparing patterns across samples.As hypothesized, significantly greater difficulties in emotion regu-\nlation were observed in the misophonia group compared to the sub-\nclinical group. Large effect sizes were observed for the DERS-16 total \nscore and each of the subscales, indicating difficulties across the di-\nmensions of emotion regulation. These findings dovetail with past \nresearch showing worse emotion regulation abilities in clinical \ncompared to control samples (e.g., Miola et al., 2022 ; Oldershaw et al., \n2015 ; Stellern et al., 2023 ). Collectively, this evidence indicates emotion \ndysregulation is central to many disorders, particularly when negative \nemotions are present, and misophonia is no exception. As those with \nmisophonia exhibited deficits across all emotion regulation abilities, \nfuture research should conduct comparisons with clinical groups to \nidentify deficits that may be particularly unique to misophonia \nsymptomatology.\nConsistent with prior work (Guetta et al., 2022 ), difficulties in \nemotion regulation accounted for unique variance in misophonia \nsymptoms after controlling for demographic factors and current stress. \nGiven this result was observed in a nationally representative sample, this \nfinding is particularly noteworthy and indicates a robust relationship \nbetween these variables that is not influenced by sampling and selection \nbiases that are inherent to most studies. The models examining emotion \ndysregulation as a predictor of reactions to misophonia sounds and \nmisophonia-related impairment yielded medium effects and accounted \nfor a larger portion of variance compared to the model predicting \nsensitivity to misophonia sounds where a small effect was observed. This \npattern aligns with theoretical models of emotion regulation (Gratz \net al., 2018 ; Gratz and Roemer, 2004 ) that emphasize how individuals Table 1 \nDescriptive statistics and zero-order correlations for study variables.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n1.

Nevertheless, \nemotion regulation accounted for a small, but significant portion of \nvariance in sensitivity to misophonia sounds. In this model, the Clarity, \nGoals, and Nonacceptance subscales were significant, which corre -\nsponds to difficulties in knowing and being clear about one’s emotions, \nfocusing on and engaging in goal-directed behaviors, and having a \ntendency to be less accepting of distress reactions and experiencing \nsecondary negative reactions to the distress (e.g., anger, embarrass -\nment), respectively. Although it is possible that these aspects of emotion \ndysregulation may predispose someone to greater sensitivity to or \nperception of trigger sounds, it seems unlikely that these factors would \ninfluence the frequency of exposure to misophonia sounds. However, in \nlight of the cross-sectional nature of the study design, one consideration \nis that greater frequency of exposure to misophonia sounds may worsen \none’s abilities to regulate emotions in these specific ways. Future studies \nusing experimental and experience sampling methodologies are needed \nto understand the temporal associations among these processes.\nWith regard to the model predicting emotional and behavioral re-\nactions to misophonia, all tested dimensions of emotion dysregulation \nwere significant, and emotion dysregulation accounted for a larger \nportion of the variance than current stress or demographic factors. Prior \nwork has similarly found a unique association between general emotion \ndysregulation and misophonia emotions and behaviors (Guetta et al., \n2022 ) and shown that difficulties inhibiting impulsive behaviors when \ndistressed mediated the relationship between trait neuroticism and \nmisophonia symptoms (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ). The current results extend the literature by specifically identifying emotional clarity, \nemotional acceptance, and the abilities to remain in control of one’s \nbehaviors and engage in goal-directed behaviors when distressed as \nimportant factors that may affect one’s reaction to misophonia triggers. \nMoreover, three of the four emotion regulation abilities, including the \nClarity, Goals, and Impulse subscales, were also significant predictors of \nmisophonia-related impairment. The results are the first to demonstrate \nthat emotion dysregulation is significantly and uniquely associated with \nimpaired functioning in misophonia. Taken together, these findings may \nbe useful for informing treatments for individuals with misophonia. \nSpecifically, clinicians should consider implementing treatment strate -\ngies that may directly or indirectly target these respective emotion \nregulation abilities to improve misophonia symptoms (see Gratz et al., \n2015 ).\nAlthough this study advances research on emotion regulation pro-\ncesses in misophonia and the methodology addresses sampling and se-\nlection biases inherent to other studies, there are notable limitations that \nshould be considered. First, this study was cross-sectional and causality \ncannot be inferred from the current results. Prospective studies are \nneeded to examine which factors of emotion dysregulation predict the \nonset and worsening of misophonia. Second, the number of survey items \nwas limited. Although the questionnaires included in this study have \nbeen shown to have strong psychometric properties, more comprehen -\nsive questionnaires may offer additional insights on patterns of emotion \nregulation in misophonia. In addition, future work should consider the \nuse recently developed measures of misophonia that emphasize the \ncriteria provided by the consensus definition of misophonia (e.g., Duke \nVanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire; Williams et al., 2022 ) Table 3 \nHierarchical regression analyses examining the unique role of emotion dysregulation in misophonia.\nMisophonia Sounds Misophonia Reactions Misophonia Impairment\nn 3896 n 3602 n 3696\nΔR2B SE p ΔR2B SE p ΔR2B SE p\nStep 1 .038 ​ ​ D.001 .065 ​ ​ D.001 .041 ​ ​ D.001\nGender ​\u00002.12 .19 D.001 ​\u00001.13 .20 D.001 ​ .01 .16 .944\nAge ​ .00 .01 .961 ​\u0000.07 .01 D.001 ​\u0000.05 .01 D.001\nRace/Ethnicity ​ .75 .20 D.001 ​\u0000.30 .21 .155 ​\u0000.17 .17 .305\nEducation ​ .55 .21 .008 ​\u0000.36 .22 .100 ​\u0000.12 .18 .501\nMarital Status ​ .06 .21 .863 ​\u0000.30 .22 .167 ​\u0000.28 .18 .121\nEmployment ​\u0000.24 .21 .243 ​\u0000.32 .22 .143 ​\u0000.94 .18 D.001\nIncome ​\u0000.20 .21 .358 ​\u0000.76 .22 .001 ​\u0000.60 .18 .001\nStep 2 .048 ​ ​ D.001 .099 ​ ​ D.001 .122 ​ ​ D.001\nGender ​\u00001.90 .19 D.001 ​\u0000.81 .19 D.001 ​ .29 .15 .059\nAge ​ .03 .01 D.001 ​\u0000.03 .01 D.001 ​\u0000.01 .01 .024\nRace/Ethnicity ​ .71 .19 D.001 ​\u0000.31 .20 .112 ​\u0000.18 .16 .262\nEducation ​ .74 .20 D.001 ​\u0000.07 .21 .741 ​ .15 .17 .372\nMarital Status ​ .18 .21 .386 ​\u0000.11 .21 .642 ​\u0000.10 .17 .553\nEmployment ​\u0000.08 .20 .709 ​\u0000.11 .21 .599 ​\u0000.75 .17 D.001\nIncome ​ .16 .21 .434 ​\u0000.23 .21 .279 ​\u0000.13 .17 .460\nStress ​ .43 .03 D.001 ​ .63 .03 D.001 ​ .57 .03 D.001\nStep 3 .038 ​ ​ D.001 .112 ​ ​ D.001 .119 ​ ​ D.001\nGender ​\u00001.70 .19 D.001 ​\u0000.60 .18 .001 ​ .46 .14 .001\nAge ​ .04 .01 D.001 ​\u0000.01 .01 .084 ​ .01 .01 .127\nRace/Ethnicity ​ .44 .19 .020 ​\u0000.66 .18 D.001 ​\u0000.46 .15 .002\nEducation ​ .61 .20 .002 ​\u0000.04 .19 .856 ​ .21 .16 .173\nMarital Status ​ .29 .20 .154 ​ .05 .19 .780 ​ .08 .16 .606\nEmployment ​ .10 .20 .612 ​ .23 .19 .241 ​\u0000.45 .16 .003\nIncome ​ .19 .21 .344 ​\u0000.24 .20 .222 ​\u0000.13 .16 .414\nStress ​ .20 .04 D.001 ​ .23 .03 D.001 ​ .25 .03 D.001\nClarity ​ .24 .09 .008 ​ .31 .08 D.001 ​ .50 .07 D.001\nGoals ​ .25 .05 D.001 ​ .19 .05 D.001 ​ .11 .04 .005\nImpulse ​ .08 .07 .225 ​ .62 .06 D.001 ​ .50 .05 D.001\nNonacceptance ​ .15 .06 .009 ​ .19 .05 D.001 ​ .09 .04 .031\nNote.

Third, stress was included as a \ncontrol variable to capture current distress resulting from external \nstressors and psychological symptoms; however, future studies should \nconsider accounting for additional diagnoses or psychological processes \nthat may impact emotion dysregulation and misophonia symptoms (e.g., \nanxiety, depression). Fourth, in the absence of diagnostic criteria, this \nstudy identified individuals with clinical levels of misophonia by using \ntwo criterion that have been established in prior research (Dixon et al., \n2024 ; Jakubovski et al., 2022 ; Mollmann et al., 2023 ). However, miso-\nphonia is a heterogenous disorder. The current findings indicate \nemotion dysregulation is important in misophonia, and in particular, \nreactions to misophonia sounds and impairment. Nevertheless, addi-\ntional research is needed to comprehensively understand how emotion \nregulation abilities and strategies factor into the development, mainte -\nnance, and treatment of misophonia.\nFinally, we were unable to examine the specific role of engagement \nin emotion regulation strategies (i.e., DERS-16 Strategies subscale) due \nto multicollinearity; however, moderate bivariate correlations were \nobserved for its association with reactions to misophonia sounds and \nmisophonia-related impairment. Additional studies are needed to \nexplicate how this specific emotion regulation ability relates to miso-\nphonia symptoms in the context of other psychological factors. \nFurthermore, this study used Gratz and Roemer ’s conceptualization of \nemotion dysregulation, which is posited to function as the higher-level \nprocessing of emotions in a situation that subsequently informs the se-\nlection and deployment of discreet emotion regulation strategies (e.g., \nreappraisal, suppression) that are further delineated by Gross ’s process \nmodel of emotion regulation (Gratz et al., 2018 ; Gross, 2015 ). Future \nresearch should consider the repertoire of emotion regulation abilities \nand strategies that may be most beneficial to individuals with miso-\nphonia to further inform the development of effective treatment \npackages.\n5.Conclusions\nIn sum, this is one of the first studies to examine specific factors of \nemotion dysregulation in misophonia. The results indicate emotion \ndysregulation is important in misophonia by differentiating individuals \nwith clinical levels of misophonia from those with subclinical miso-\nphonia and demonstrating significant associations with misophonia \nsymptoms. Moreover, medium effects were observed for the unique role \nof emotion dysregulation, beyond demographics and stress, in models \nexamining reactions to misophonia sounds and misophonia-related \nimpairment. These findings are strengthened by this study ’s rigorous \nmethodology, including probability-based sampling and a sample \nrepresentative of the U.S. population, and underscore the need for \nadditional research examining this factor in misophonia, particularly \ngiven the limited treatment options for misophonia and the ability to \naddress emotion dysregulation through psychological interventions to \nimprove outcomes (Gratz et al., 2015 ; Sakiris and Berle, 2019 ).\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nLaura J.
