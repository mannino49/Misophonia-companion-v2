      "text": "For Whom the Bell Tolls: Misophonia as a complex experience \nof hope and dread in self-with-other regulation\nDayna Sharp, LCSW\nInstitute for the Psychoanalytic Study of Subjectivity\nABSTRACT\nMisophonia is a condition in which everyday sounds evoke pain and \nreactive aversion. The etiology of misophonia is largely unknown, with \ndiscordant conceptualizations of its roots, ranging from psychiatric, to \nneurological, to a combination of auditory processing and neurobiolo -\ngical dysfunction. Common protocols are focused on symptom reduc -\ntion and management, though have not been proven to be clinically \neffective. For these reasons, it is generally considered to be difficult to \ntreat. In this paper, I re-consider misophonia as a complex interweaving \nof auditory, neurobiological and relational experience. Reflecting upon \na clinical case, I present misophonia in the context of self-with-other \nregulation from a developmental lens, traverse the landscape of mis-\nophonic self states, explore the complex toll of dissociation and inter -\ngenerational trauma in relational space, and consider ways in which the \npainful somatic-auditory bell of misophonia concretizes self and rela-\ntional “hope” and “dread”. Finally, I will offer some thoughts on how \npsychoanalytic psychotherapy can create new relational- \nneurobiological pathways out of the misophonic experience.KEYWORDS \nAffect regulation; \ndissociative identification; \nintersubjectivity; \nmisophonia; \nsadomasochistic systems; \nsurrender; trauma\nNow this bell tolling softly for another, says to me, Thou must die. \n-John Donne, 1623\n“For Whom the Bell Tolls” is the powerful opening to John Donne’s “17th Meditation”, \ninvoking in the reader a sense of foreboding, if not looming, death (1923 , p. 1). Donne, a poet \nand cleric, penned his meditations during a severe, painful and progressive illness of unknown \norigin—his own death in the foreground of his experience and mind. Not uncommon for the \nera, Donne made sense of his illness as “internal”, caused by “sin that infects his soul” (Belling, \nMar 13, Belling, 2002 , para. 3). Donne’s religiosity organized his understanding of that which \nfelt so wrong inside of him. His relationship with religion also propelled his belief that “all \nmankind is of one author, and is one volume . . . ” (para. 1), a connectedness he saw as the vital \npathway to something “more”. In the phrase, “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, Donne vivifies the \nfuneral bells of the church, and in doing so, elicits an awareness of both the limits and edges of \nhuman life, as well as a felt reverberation and connectedness between individuals—a web of \nrelationality and interpersonal impact. As Donne proclaims, “Now this bell tolling softly for \nanother, says to me, Thou must die”, he suggests that everything human—love, connected -\nness, sin and especially death belongs to us all.\nCONTACT Dayna Sharp \n daynawsharp@gmail.com \n Psychoanalytic, Institute for the Psychoanalytic Study of \nSubjectivity, New York 08033, USAPSYCHOANALYSIS, SELF AND CONTEXT             \nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/24720038.2024.2332240\n© 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC"

      "text": "In 1940, Ernest Hemingway borrowed Donne’s landscape of life, death, morality and \nconnectedness in his novel “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, bringing these themes closer to his \nown socio-political context, the Spanish Civil War. Finally, Donna Orange (2006 ) brings us \na psychoanalytic use of the phrase in her paper “For Whom the Bell Tolls: Context, \nComplexity, and Compassion in Psychoanalysis”, in which she expands themes of love \nwith compassion, death with suffering and morality with ethics in the realm of psycho -\nanalytic theory and practice. From this expansive historical-cultural web, the poetics of the \nline, “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and the literary themes embedded within, can contribute \nimportant subsymbolic imagery and texture in order to think and feel into misophonia—the \nforeboding and overpowering experience of sound that elicits a kind of felt psycho-somatic \ndeath, along with relational reverberations feverishly pulling between love, loss and \nmorality.\nMisophonia in its literal sense refers to the hatred of sounds. In neuro-psychological \nlanguage, it is described as an intense, negative emotional reaction often associated with \nbodily sounds like chewing, breathing, and foot tapping (Edelstein et al., 2013 , p. 1). Its \netiology is yet unknown (Dozier, 2017 , p. 431). Some have conceptualized misophonia as \npsychiatric in nature (Schröder et al., 2013 ), while others dismiss any such correlation \n(Palumbo et al., 2018 , p. 2). More contemporary researchers view misophonia as a condition \nwith multidimensional roots—a combination of organic neurobiological differences linked \nwith auditory processing impairment, tied with enhanced limbic and autonomic reactivity, \nsometimes co-mingled with psychiatric dis-order and/or neurodivergence (Norris et al.,  \n2022 ).\nIn experience-near language, sufferers describe sensations of unbearable physical and \nemotional pain, almost a kind of felt death, if not murder. Sounds that others hear softly and \nwith a sense of “going-on-being” (Winnicott, 1960 , p. 586), seem to evoke a kind of \n“primitive agony” (Winnicott, 1974 , p. 104), along with an intense “rupture” (Tronick,  \n1989 ) or even full break in any kind of holding container.\nMisophonia is thought to be a “recently recognized” condition (Dozier, 2017 , p. 431). \nPerhaps an outcome of its newness, or because of its association to the neurobiological, or \nmaybe as part of an unconscious enactment of extreme aversion, my search for “misopho -\nnia” in the database of psychoanalytic literature, “Pepweb”, confronted me with \na remarkable “no results found”. There seems to be a complete absence of psychoanalytic \nrecognition, theory, or clinical case examples of this human experience. From this place, \nI write this paper with a consideration that absence is both “an emptiness from which one \ncan begin” (Winnicott, 1974 , p. 106) and importantly, as an empathic bridge (Ornstein,  \n2020 , Ch. 9)—perhaps a first sense into a sufferer’s experience of absence and non- \nresponsiveness in the face of something that feels so wrong, along with an expectation \nthat no hope for understanding or compassion exists. This is the relational background of \nmisophonia, and this paper is a start towards something new.\nTurning away from the “isolated mind” (Stolorow & Atwood, 1994 , Ch. 17), I present \nmisophonia in the context of “self-with-other” regulation from a developmental lens (Stern,  \n1984 , pp. 74, 181–182), traverse the landscape of misophonic self states, explore the complex \ntoll of dissociation and intergenerational trauma in relational space, and consider ways in \nwhich the painful somatic-auditory bell of misophonia concretizes self and relational \n“hope” and “dread” (Mitchell, 1993 ). Finally, I will offer some thoughts on how 2\n D. SHARP"

      "text": "psychoanalytic psychotherapy can create new relational-neurobiological pathways out of \nthe misophonic experience.\nA clinical case: Misophonia in the developmental context of self-with-other- \nregulation\nSteve was 40 years old, in his second marriage and recently had a newborn baby. In our first \nphone call, he asked me if I could help him with “anger” and especially, “misophonia”. He \nemphasized, “It’s the only thing in my life I don’t have control of”, citing a variety of \ntreatments and interventions he had attempted, all with little relief. His misophonia was in \nthe forefront of his experience and he began our work together by sharing the details of his \nsensations, feelings and thoughts during these painful times.\nSteve described a range of physical sensations: “it’s like someone’s putting a pin through \nmy eardrum”, “my middle ear is full of water”, “my nose or the corner of my eye begins to \nache”; then, “my ear, jaw, eye and nose all start to throb”, “I feel an icy dread in my chest”; \nfinally, “it feels like my eardrum is about to burst!” and “there’s an ice pick stabbing me \nbetween my eyes!”.\nSteve’s pain becomes visible by way of his facial expressions and body language, and I am \naware of my own body tensing. I notice my somatic resonance, as well as Steve’s choice to \nbegin with his felt sensory-somatic experience, marking the potential significance that the \nsomatic dimension (Bucci, 2007 , p. 244) will have in our work. I also notice in his \ndescription an escalation of affective intensity. When I ask him more about it, he tells me:\n“It starts with agitation”, “anticipatory anxiety” and “anger—my heart beats quickly, and \nmy breath shallows”. This leads to a “search” or hyperfocus for the “source” and an attempt \nto determine whether “the source should be able to control the sound” - that is—“if they are \nat fault for making the terrible sound”. This evokes “more agitation” and “angry and even \nviolent thoughts”. “Now I’m nearing panic and rage”, which looks like “trying not to mimic \nthe sound”, a “desperate attempt to make the sound less alien and horrifying”, as well as \n“trying not to punch myself”, “flee the vicinity” or “shout” at the source.\nInquiry into the intensity of his sensory-somatic experience opens up Steve’s affective \nworld, and illuminates a sense of progression and sequence. From the very beginning of our \nwork, through the relational context of empathic immersion, Steve and I organically began \nlinking connections between multiple dimensions of his self experience (Bion, 1967 ; \nMcDougall, 1980 , p. 342).\nThis process of linking naturally led to an unfolding and meaning-making process, in \nwhich Steve explored his cognitive world. He described his escalating thoughts, leading up \nto and through the misophonia.\nInitially, Steve recognizes his physiological-affective-somatic sensations, senses that the \nmisophonia is near and fears that he “won’t have control” over the sound, the pain and/or \nhis reactions, that he won’t “know how to get out of the situation”, and that “everything” \nand in particular, his “relationship will be ruined forever”.\nAs we began to more fully understand Steve’s felt experience, I became more tuned into \na deep sense of how fraught with violence, fragility, pain and fear his relationship with \nhimself and others could be. As we tried to make sense of when the misophonia was present \n—or not—he began to tell me more about the sounds that activated the misophonia. This \nranged from people “eating and chewing”, which he evaluated as low on his reactivity scale, PSYCHOANALYSIS, SELF AND CONTEXT\n 3"

      "text": "to his wife singing “out of tune” to their baby, which he described as “painfully high”. Steve \nbelieved that his wife’s “voice changed” after having their baby, which set off his misophonia \nwith “extreme intensity and pain”. I silently noted the association between the emergence of \nmisophonia in the context of his wife’s evolving identity as a mother, and invited him to \nexplore early memories of misophonia. He immediately associated to his mother’s smoker’s \ncough, and also recalled experiencing misophonia in reaction to his father “groaning” in \npain. Steve described a sense of “revulsion” he experienced as he shared these early \nmoments with me. I considered Mary Douglas’ (1966 ) anthropological work on revulsion \nas a need to purify oneself, to evacuate something impure, and wondered if and how this \nmight open later. But at this time, I focused on a potential connection between the \nmisophonia and the context of parenting, mothering, nurturing and/or early childhood, \nbut this did not resonate:\n“No—I didn’t have misophonia with my first wife, and we had kids”, matter of factly \nadding, “she wasn’t a threat”. Although I’d tuned into the relational surround in which the \nmost painful misophonia inhabited, I’d missed what felt most experience-near to Steve—the \nperception of threat. I wondered then about this important difference—what was it that \nmade someone a threat? What was it about Steve’s new wife that felt threatening that he \nhadn’t experienced with his ex? “It’s just her voice, nothing else. Since she became a mother, \nshe has more phlegm in her throat”. “Her vocal chords have changed”, and “now the tone of \nher voice is deeply fucking unpleasant”. “That’s it”. Any contextual link between Steve’s \nrevulsive memory of his own mother’s phlegm, and his current sense that his wife’s voice \nwas distorted by “phlegm” since becoming a mother, or even that each sound/reception of \nthe sound activated Steve’s misophonia along with its sensory-somatic-affective-cognitive \nconfigurations that he’d already described, was refused. Steve was adamant with an air of \nanger in these moments, dismissing my attempts at exploration, and recounted what felt \nlike an “absolutism” – “a radical decontextualization serving vital restorative and defensive \nfunctions”, that was “not open for discussion” (Atwood, quoted in Stolorow, 1999 , pp. 466– \n467). He simply reiterated his sense of “revulsion” for his wife’s “out of tune”-ness while \n“singing to the baby”, seemingly desperate for me to understand. He felt “infuriated by her \nvoice”, and chronically “enraged” that she “would not stop humming or singing” to their \nnewborn. In the air of contemptuous and rageful affect, I found it hard to breathe, much less \nthink. I felt a chasm between our subjectivities, all while attempting to maintain a stance of \nhumility and a “hermeneutic of trust” (Orange, 2006 , p. 31). Yet, the contempt, rage and \nrevulsion for his wife—his baby’s mother—along with his extreme ideas on parenting and \nmothering specifically, were nearly impossible for me to digest. In these moments, \nI experienced Steve as icy cold and even annihilating. I felt blown away, outraged, angry, \nprofoundly averse and sometimes frozen in his presence. In the most intense moments, \nI struggled with a fantasy and powerful bodily urge to either “shout” at him or to “flee the \nvicinity” - in the same way that Steve described reacting to his most intense experiences of \nmisophonia. As I recognized these feelings as empathic to his own self and relational \nexperience, I became more able to contain and digest these disorganizing affects, enabling \nme to hold onto Orange’s stance of “trust” and the sense of Steve as a whole person. I hoped \nthat through a focus on his self-development and growth, he could become more able to \nhold, contain and digest these painful affects himself (Grossmark, 2012 , pp. 643–4). I also \nimagined that as Steve felt more understood through our empathic connection, he would no \nlonger need to “clench” away from an “endangered psychic reality”, thereby becoming more 4\n D.

      "text": "able to flexibly open up these absolutisms into dialogue between us (Atwood, quoted in \nStolorow, 1999 , pp. 466–467).\nHeld by my psychoanalytic ancestors, I was able to freely wonder about Steve’s \nexperience and to muse about the connections between misophonia and threat, pain \nand revulsion, as well as affect and attachment—with both parents, and most specifically \nwith a maternal figure. Had his wife’s transition into motherhood re-activated early \nrelational experiences with that of his own mother? Was there a sense of envy under -\nlying Steve’s wish/demand for his wife to stop singing to their baby? Did Steve fear \nlosing her to the baby? Did Steve long for her love and care, imagining that there wasn’t \nenough for both of them? Was his affective flooding a response to an early childhood \nexperience of a wished-for and needed love and attachment in the face of a felt rejection \n—a sense of having been “dropped”? (Green, 1986 , p.149). Was the misophonia and this \nparticular sound cue—Linda’s singing “out of tune” - a concretization of an early \nsurround of maternal “out of tune-ness”, or misattunement? These were questions \nthat couldn’t be asked explicitly, but were held in my mind as we moved forward \ntogether.\nRelational configurations, procedural memory and self-with-other \norganization\nAs I learned more about Steve’s relational history and the here and now dynamics \nbetween the two of us, the air of the intersubjective field began to take on a recognizable \ntexture and more visible form. Steve’s most intense and overwhelming experiences of \nmisophonia seemed to be tied with relational configurations consisting of an intrusive \nand abandoning other, linked to a correlated self experience encoded with affective- \nsomatic pain, aversiveness, powerlessness and narcissistic rage. Steve felt his mom’s \ncough and his father’s groaning as an intrusive “thing” he desperately needed to—but \ncould not—get out. His automatic, self-preservative revulsion and aversiveness was met \nwith withdrawal and anger, rather than protection and comfort. This, in turn, invoked \na rage—both a desperate call for help, as well as a self-protective shield. Over time, this \nrepetitive sequence culminated in deep wounds in Steve’s sense of self and in his \nexpectations with others. Stolorow, Orange and Atwood note, “Experiences of self and \nworld are inextricably bound up with one another, in that any dramatic change in the \none necessarily entails corresponding changes in the other” (Atwood et al., 2002 , p. 285). \nFor Steve, this bi-directionality is charged with progressive relational misunderstanding \nand pain, leading to a repeated sense of unformulate-able and unregulatable affect \n(Beebee, Cohen and Lachmann, 2016 , pp. 12, 168). In such a relational surround, each \nparticipant impacts the other, escalating the other affectively and behaviorally, until the \npoint of disruption without repair (Tronick, 1989 ). In childhood, this is a picture of \ndisorganized attachment (Beebee, Cohen and Lachmann, 2016 , pp. 195–230). Steve came \nto learn that important others would either overpower his subjectivity, or withdraw \ncompletely, and this expectation was repeatedly re-experienced and re-confirmed in his \ninteractions with his wife. This disorganizing relational context echoes Beebee, Cohen \nand Lachmann’s “Illustrations of Expectancies’’:PSYCHOANALYSIS, SELF AND CONTEXT\n 5"

Where are you? \nI feel helpless to influence you. I feel frantic”. (p. 212)\nAnd:\nWhen I get upset, you get upset. You might get angry at me. You might threaten me with \nterrible, scary faces. And you won’t even recognize that I’m upset . . . What can I do? I still need \nyou. I still want you to love me. (p. 228)\nFrom a self psychological, intersubjective and attachment-based lens, this is the sound of the \nrelational expectancies in which misophonia thrives.\nFurther, Steve reminds me that his misophonia and pain are most intense when he \nperceives the out-of-tune-other as intentionally choosing to cause him harm. From \na developmental perspective, I consider the potential collision between a child’s tempera -\nmental somatic-sensory-motor-affective-cognitive capacities and the normative omnipo -\ntence children imagine both in themselves and their needed others (Ornstein, 1984 , p. 360). \nJust as a child believes that the magic of a mother’s kiss on a booboo takes away the pain, the \nchild who experiences auditory or sensory processing difficulties may similarly believe that \nmother is magically and intentionally causing the pain. In other words, as the body \ndiscomfort, misattunement, dysregulation and mind-body pain repeat, an all-powerful \n“bad mother” is born—psychically and relationally represented. She is the mother for \nwhom the child must always search, both from a need for self-protection from her and \nbecause she feels like home.\nI could more clearly hear how his wife’s maternal “out of tune” voice, mirroring an \nimprinted experience and expectation of something wrong, impure and painful, reverber -\nating in Steve’s ears, body, self and relational air, evokes further dysregulation, flooding and \npain, ultimately unfolding to anger, aggression, rage and/or (hostile) aversion. This \nsequence re-enacts Steve’s early, repetitive pain of finding his desperately needed other, \nonly to discover her intrusiveness, absence, incongruence, anger, withdrawal, rejection and \ngeneral “bad mother-ness”, as well as echoes of Beebee, Cohen and Lachmann’s “I still want \nyou to love me!” .\nSteve describes this sequence as “annihilating”. We sit, with shared tears, and from a this \nplace of profound pain, I experienced a moving sense of the “intersubjective catastrophe in \nwhich psychologically sustaining relations to others have broken down at their most \nfundamental level” (Atwood, Orange and Stolorow, 2002 , p. 288). I could more fully \nunderstand that for Steve, this “breaking” was “the loss of affirming, validating connections \nto others and the shattering of the subjective world by impingement and usurpation” \n(p. 288).\nI reflected on the ways in which this catastrophic breaking lived in the relationship \nbetween Steve and I, recalling my attempts to link experience and his protective, absolute \nnegations. I—we—came so close to fully re-enacting a core part of Steve’s misophonia and \nits relational context: the abandonment and felt loss of the other, as I fantasized of fleeing \n(“Where are you? ”), the sense of having been overpowered, overtaken, annihilated—as \nI became fixed in my own subjectivity, effectively overpowering his own (“I’m frantic !”), \nthe sense that something bad inside that needs to get out—the revulsion and fury we both \nfelt, culminating with aggressive thoughts and actions (“Stop singing to the baby!” and for \nme, shouting at him or reactively referring him out).

We lived together in a world of unmovable absolutisms, foreclosing the \npossibility for mentalization or dialogue. Hence, this frozen self-with-other experience \ncontinued to live as a powerful and enduring procedural memory, encoded into the mind \nand body of the child, imprinted into the adult self (Stern, 1984 , pp. 181–2). His self harm \nbehaviors like hitting or punching himself are part of this “theater” (McDougall, 1980 , \np. 420). He turns his aggression upon himself, a desperate attempt for regulation—a \nreplacing of cognitive-affective pain with temporary somatic pain, and/or searching for \nthe bounds and limits of his body in effort to feel some kind of containment and cohesive -\nness (Ferguson, personal communication, March 21, 2023). Of course, these attempts aren’t \nfully effective, ultimately re-affirming Steve’s deep sense of shame about his ability to “be \nreasonable” and, derailing any sense of agency or mastery within his own sense of self.\nPotential for “something more”: Relational safety and psychotherapeutic \nchange\nAs we have been able to survive these disorganizing self-with-other relational configura -\ntions in the here and now of our work, our relationship has become a kind of “secure base” \n(Ainsworth, 1963 , p. 932). This sense of self-with-other safety has been relationally trans -\nformative for Steve, opening his capacity to relate to me in increasingly vulnerable and \nauthentic ways that were previously inaccessible. He frequently sobs through sessions, \ntelling me how “alone” and “panicked” he feels, his sense of himself as “lost, without \na map”. I invite him into a “therapeutic dissociation” (Davies, 1996 , p. 567), through \nwhich he tells me how much he cares for me, wishing I could “wrap him in a blanket”. \nI have become a good mother—an important other who receives him with care and \ntenderness, someone with whom he experiences a needed sense of security. He is moved \nto tears as he sings to me, sharing his baby’s favorite lullaby. In these moments, I’m struck \nwith his expanding capacity to feel empathic and deeply connected with his self-needs and \nwith those of his own children. I pick up these openings—Steve’s healthy developmental \nstrivings—and hold them, nurture them, and in my imagination, wrap them up in a baby \nblanket.\nAs we relate in this way, I feel a sense of “something more” to our symbolized commu -\nnication and an emergence of something new. I consider Beebe, Cohen and Lachmann’s \nconception of nonverbal, cross-modal correspondence (2016 , p. 32), sensing that through \nthese real and imaginative “micromoments”, Steve and I had been able to “feel-what-has- \nbeen-perceived-in-the-other” (Stern et al., 1985 , p. 263), co-creating a relational experience \nin which Steve felt in-tune, understood and relationally effective. As Steve became more \nconnected to “good” internal objects, he began to feel a more cohesive, consistent sense of \nself, becoming more able to share, bear and integrate “bad” objects and his repetitive, \ntrailing edge relational experiences. In recognizing my potential participation in Steve’s \ndreaded self-with-other relational world, yet committing to the possibility for “something \nmore” and something new, I was able to nurture Steve’s strivings for relational safety, \nplayful forward development and transformative change (Boston Change Process Study \nGroup, 2005 ).PSYCHOANALYSIS, SELF AND CONTEXT\n 7"

In the beginning of \nour work, Steve’s self states alternated between lonely, powerless and fragmenting to \nimpenetrable, icy cold and aggressive. As Steve came to feel a greater sense of cohesion, \nwe became more able to recognize a variety of fluctuating, spontaneous—yet connected— \nself states (Bromberg, 1996 , p. 514).

Perhaps another example of cross-modal corre -\nspondence, it was at this time that my own sense of creativity and openness led me to reverie \nabout Hemingway’s “For Whom the Bell Tolls” (Hemingway, 1940 ).\nThe novel offers a thematic tapestry of love and death, invincibility and vulnerability, \nheroism and sacrifice that lends ripe metaphor for Steve’s internal world. Set in the context \nof the Spanish Civil War, Hemingway evokes images of violence and murderous aggression, \nprofound internal divisions and splits, alliances and dehumanizing objectifications, as well \nas an overall sense of the implosion of a whole into parts. The Spanish War was supported \nby the German Nazi party and is thought to be a prelude to WWII; in this way, the war \ncould be thought of as a series of violent splits that unfolded into a near full European \ncollapse of cohesion under the rise of authoritarian, subjugating and annihilating \nleadership.\nIts main character, Jordan was a dutiful soldier, ordered to infiltrate enemy lines and \nblow up a bridge—a strategic war effort. Jordan falls in love in this landscape of catastrophe, \nhis partner a survivor of rape and parental murder. Jordan completes his errand, detonating \nthe bomb, but is injured in a retaliatory attack. Severely wounded and facing his imminent \ndeath, he sacrifices his own life to save his love, ultimately dying in agonizing pain.\nSteve grew up in a kind of war. He experienced his parents as contemptuous and hostile \nto one another, his mother “full of rage” and his father unavailable. He often felt rejected \nand unwanted, bringing to mind Ferenczi’s “Unwelcome Child” (Ferenczi, 1929 ). Steve \nmade the ultimate sacrifice: he accommodated, fitting into edges of the scene, fulfilling the \nrole of his character—experiencing himself as the “bad”, “difficult” kid, invoking the idea of \na Fairbainian moral dilemma (Fairbairn, 1943 , p. 65).\nAdding to Steve’s sense of out-of-tuneness, about a year into our work, he was \ndiagnosed on the Autism Spectrum. This reinforced his sense of himself as “a pain \nin the ass” and “difficult”. From my perspective, his diagnosis lended further \npossibilities for empathic understanding. I leaned toward the “Intense World” theory \nof mind—illuminating a child’s neurobiological wiring for “hyper-perception, hyper- \nattention, hyper-memory and hyper-emotionality” (Markram & Markram, 2010 , \np. 1). I came to understand the overwhelm to which young Steve was neurobiolo -\ngically vulnerable, as well as the ways in which absence and aggression in his \nrelational surround could tragically and powerfully collide with his constitutional \nvulnerability to anxiety, fear, and affective disorganization, all while leaving Steve \nunprotected, alone, and at times annihilated by flooding affect. I imagined Steve as \na young child with little sense of differentiation, containment, or cohesiveness, akin \nto the Kleinian or Bionian child’s experience of painful fragmented affect moving in 8\n D.

Ogden (1989 ) views “autistic” vulnerability \nas a potential for “collapse” into what seems to be a terrifying, “tyrannizing impri -\nsonment in a closed system of bodily sensations” (p. 137). Tustin (1990 ) adds to the \nsense of terror, writing, “These perseverative . . . activities mean that they feel \ntrapped in an isolated idiosyncratic world of bodily sensations that are not shared \nwith other persons and from which there seems to be no escape” (p. 14). I reverie to \nthe terror associated with the collapse of a nation, of its neighbors, of a continent— \nthe bullets, bombs, and fragments burning down buildings, homes, skin. Olin (1975 ) \nadds, “The autistic child’s identity problem is one of feeling so small and insignif -\nicant that he hardly exists. So he defends against feelings of non-existence by using \nall his strength and ability to try to be a shell of indestructible power” (quoted in \nTustin, 1990 , p. 5).1 Young Steve, caught in a war, lacking a protective skin (Ogden,  \n1989 , p. 128), was left to frantically search for some kind of self-map, borders, \nterritories, edges and extreme defense. War creates chaotic states of terror and \nterrorizing, murdered and murder, existence and non-existence, defeat and triumph. \nAs Steve’s inner world molded to this landscape, disorganized states of loving, \nsplitting, sacrifice, psycho-somatic-affective and relational death, murder and invin -\ncibility seemed to be atmospheric.\nIt is a similar kind of war that Steve inhabits with his wife and new baby—the terror of \nthe bombs of his wife’s lullaby from a distance incomprehensible, yet experienced by Steve \nas very real and fundamentally threatening. Relational warfare seems to be a shadow, \na procedural relational memory of a system that continues to haunt his sense of self and \nhis marriage. He refers to Linda as a “Nazi”, telling me that he feels he “doesn’t matter” to \nher, and that his needs “can’t be met”. Steve frequently dreams of being attacked, and \nattacking back, repeatedly awakening to an experience of himself “punching into the air”. \nThese attacks ring like the misophonic sounds perpetrated against his auditory, limbic and \nautonomic system. Steve’s early war-like experience was internalized and unformulated, \ninhabiting his nervous system and body, evacuated like a bomb (Grossmark, 2012 , p. 641) \ninto the air of his relationships, perpetuating and re-enacting the war. This is the “Dread to \nRepeat” (Ornstein, 1991 ).\nHe tells me that his wife experiences him as an “impenetrable wall”, and how good it feels \nto be “invincible”. But this shield isn’t fully protective against his feelings of not-mattering, \nnot existing, so he attacks himself to harden it up, by way of attack—punching himself or \ndepriving himself of any form of nourishment—all desperate attempts to regulate the pain.\nMuch like Hemingway’s main character, Steve feels deeply wounded, struggling in this \ninternal war within his own body-mind. His wounds are psychically embodied with shame, \ndisgust and revulsion. His injuries, the shadow of warfare and internal civil war at once set \nhim up for a reactive aggression (Kohut, 1972 , p. 380) and aversion (Lichtenberg, \nLachmann and Fosshage, 2011 , p. 16)—a quest for detonation and invincibility. We also \ncame to recognize a self state of sacrifice, sometimes escalating to thoughts of suicide—a \nstrategy to protect his family—“At least they would have the insurance money”. But we are \n1Olin’s quote offers imagistic, phenomenologically valuable insight into potential self experience of a child on the autism \nspectrum.  At the same time, the language of the paper’s title reflects the social-cultural diagnostic framework of his time, \nwhich, from this author’s point of view, is one that privileges an authoritative, other-centered, intrapsychic model of \nthinking that forecloses possibility for empathy and/or meaning-making, while perpetuating the othering of vulnerable \nchildren.PSYCHOANALYSIS, SELF AND CONTEXT\n 9"

This state allows Steve to feel more safe within his \nself, to feel a sense of justice for his family and the world at large, “doing what I can to make \nthe world a better place”. Steve can “stand in the spaces” (Bromberg, 1996 ), moving from \nstate to state with increased sense of flexibility and agency. These states of love, aggression \nand invincibility, threat of death and sacrifice, can be thought of as the landscape of out-of- \ntuneness that bi-directionally connects to the toll of the bell—Steve’s misophonia.\nThe complex toll of intergenerational trauma\nNo man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main . . . \nany man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to \nknow for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. \n–Donne, Meditation 17, Devotions, p.1\nSteve is not an island; he, like all of us, is deeply connected to the past, present and future. \nHe is born of his parents, grandparents and ancestors, and has given life to children of his \nown. They are all intertwined. Steve intuitively understands this, telling me that he is fearful \nof the impact of his anger on his children, yet also feels “guilty” that he parents differently \nthan his own mother, whom he describes as “abusive”. In these moments, we recognize \ntogether how very much Steve strives to be separate from, but also still feels very attached to \nand identified with, his mother. I’m reminded of Fairbairn’s contribution (Fairbairn, 1943 ) \nto an analytic understanding of the powerful attachments to “bad” abusive objects.\nImportantly, Steve became aware that he experiences an overwhelming misophonic \nreaction when he senses the voice of his mother inside of himself. Crying, Steve shared, “I \nwas alone in my room so much of the time, punished for weeks. She was so angry. I was so \nscared of her”. I’d offer, “You needed her to help contain you, to hold you together, to help \nyou feel safe, but instead, you were left alone and terrified”. Like a snap of a finger, Steve’s \nbody repositioned, and he responded with a sense of contempt, a sneer, a self-negation, “I \nwas a pain in the ass. I’m glad my parents didn’t give me anything, otherwise I’d be weak”. \nIn these moments, all the air left the room; his words and affect landed upon me in a way \nthat made it hard to breathe. Steve’s “impenetrable wall” was up, I couldn’t access what felt \nlike “him” or even a sense of connectedness with our “going on being” relationship for the \nrest of the session—or weeks of sessions. During these times, I felt powerless to reach him, \nlearning that Steve felt equally powerless to find himself. Sands refers to this kind of \nexperience as a “disjunctive self state”, developed from “relational trauma from the past \nand which has its own affective ‘truth,’ behavior, sensations, knowledge, and transference” \n(2009 , p. 123). Steve and I began to tune in to these state shifts, and to try to better \nunderstand this now disjunctive state.\nOn another occasion as I held back a sneeze, Steve suddenly shifted into cold anger, \naccusing me of “mocking” and “belittling” him. We recognized this state shift in real time, \nand Steve realized that in these moments his misophonia was “painfully loud”. We came to \nunderstand that sometimes Steve’s misophonia cues the threat of his identification with and \n“possession” by his bad mother-object (Fairbairn, 1943 , p. 67). He tells me that in these \nmoments, “I can’t even feel myself”, “it’s like I’m watching myself from the outside”.

Yet at the same time, his experience also reminds me of \na kind of hypnoidal, dissociative state in which he becomes one with an object of terror \n(Ferenczi, 1985 , p. 203) that occurs through automatic mimicry (Howell, 2014 , p. 49). The \nembodiment of this frightening, aggressive and disorganizing object re-enacts earlier rela-\ntional configurations where Steve is powerlessly intruded upon, his self abandoned or \nrejected or disappeared, his misophonia activated and his rage and aversion unleashed \nupon whomever he-with-his mother is speaking. This is the texture of their tie: her falling \napart, intrusive rage and psychic collapse or dissociative death confused with Steve’s \nsubjective death or murder, his terror and sense of falling apart, and his reactive rage and \nintrusive, self-murdering identification with the terrorizing, terrifying and aggressive \nmother. The intergenerational transmission of this texture of attachment (Salberg, 2015 ) \nlives through Steve’s terrible fear of his subjective death—being overpowered and disap -\npeared by an intrusive bad mother—and of his own felt capacity to metaphorically murder \nhis children as his dissociated identification with his maternal object of terror is activated in \nrelationship with his kids.\nSteve’s misophonia could be likened to Apprey’s “urgent errand” (Apprey, 2014 , p. 21), \na desperate tie and self sacrifice designed to at once punish his mother who lives so painfully \nwithin him, yet also to protect her by becoming affectively and behaviorally just what she \nneeded him to be—self depriving and self sacrificing—an attempt to “save” her. Steve had to \nmeet her needs, to be almost non-human in order to do so. He told me once he often \nthought of himself as a “knife” - strong, invincible, needless, (as his mom needed him to be), \na weapon to hurt (how he felt his mom and sometimes himself to be), a weapon to protect \nand rescue (a childhood wish to save mom and his self), as well as an objectified thing to be \nused (“She used me for her benefit”). In many ways, Steve could not be human in relation to \nhis mother—“She always said that I had one temper tantrum as a child—just one”. Steve’s \nyounger self had to banish all of his unwelcomed, unwanted emotion and needs into exile— \nsome of which seemed to explode into fragments via the realm of sensory-somatic mis-\nophonia. This civil war within himself, once an adaptive attempt to protect himself and his \nearly attachments, continues the war of his parent’s world, of his grandparents’ military \ndays, and Steve’s fears in relation to his own children. In the face of Steve’s dissociated, \nunsymbolized embodiment of his bad mother, the present becomes “little more than \na medium through which this unprocessed past may be known” (Bromberg, 1991 , pp. -\n405–406). At the same time, Steve loves his children and delights in them so much he is \noften moved to tears. He expresses deep responsibility to protect them and longs to “break \nthe cycle”. These are the leading edges of Steve that create the possibility for “something \nmore” – the interruption of the transmission of trauma and potential for meaningful \nintergenerational change.\nMisophonia: A concretization of hope and dread\nIn his book “Hope and Dread in Psychoanalysis”, Stephen Mitchell (1993 ) speaks to an \ninnate, human relationality mired in tensions and reconciliations around our wishes and \nneeds (abs.). For Steve, hope in relationship evokes a dread of terrifying threat, pain, force \nand psycho-somatic death, from his earliest years.

      "text": "auditory—systems, creating a foundation for the development of an affectively-reactive \nmisophonia. In this way, Steve’s misophonia can be thought of as an automatic expression \nof fear and a hope that this expression can be seen and made sense of by an important other. \nTragically, this had never been understood for Steve, and therefore had never been able to \nbe regulated. Bucci notes, “A person who experiences overwhelming affect, whose source \ncannot be acknowledged, will try to provide some meaning for this and regulate emotion in \nthis way” (Bucci, 2007 , p. 63). This is how I have come to understand Steve’s explanations \nfor the sources of his misophonia, wrapped up in his psychic world and self-with-other \norganizing principles. In these ways, I understand misophonia as a terribly painful, yet \npotentially self-preservative use of an organic limbic-auditory sensitivity as a kind of sub- \nsymbolic shorthand for “something’s wrong!”. The wrong, the dreads, the threats in \nrelationship, toll the unbearable bell. For Steve, the misophonia seems to have developed \ninto a kind of sensory-auditory-somatic-autonomic nervous system “alarm” - here, I think \nof Sheldon Bach’s “narcissistic immune system” (Bach, 2011 , p. 39) and Harry Stack \nSullivan’s “self operating security system” (Stack Sullivan, 1953 , p. 191). Such an alarm is \nthe bell that tolls for a death of the other and the self in a desperately needed relational \nsurround; it is a bell that tolls for the coughing mother, drowning in phlegm, and also for \nthe psychic-somatic death of a child flooded and disorganized by unregulated, unformu -\nlated affect.\nFurther, I argue that misophonia can be thought of as a representation of disguised desire \nfor surrender (Ghent, 1990 ). From this critical lens, misophonia is not only an alarm or \na bell tolling for the death of a disorganizing other or for one’s self, but rather for the death \nof an out-of-tune, sadomasochistic system. Steve says the misophonia is a “Stop it!”, and \nmore to the affective point, an “I’m dying here! Stop!”. I interpret this as a call for \nresponsiveness, recognition, empathy and for mutual regulation. This is the hope embedded \nin the misophonia—the desire and need for a new texture of relational space, one in which \nthe possibility for self liberation through the ability to express one’s needs, states and affects \ncan exist.\nPsychoanalysis as a pathway for creating (something new)\nIt is my orientation that the most important part of any psychoanalytically-based treatment \nis a stance of empathic immersion—an attempt to progressively and expansively understand \none’s psychic world (Kohut, 1959 ). With patients who experience misophonia, this is \nespecially important, contrasting with a learned expectation of misunderstanding and \nmisattunement they often experience in relationship with important others. Donna \nOrange, influenced by Donne, invites us to work even beyond empathy into the”process \nand attitude” of “compassion” (Orange, 2006 , p. Abstract, 7). She suggests that we “. . . make \nsense of the patient’s emotional predicament within the relational system that we experience \ntogether, and gradually this shared world changes by means of a personal reorganization of \nexperience (of both participants) (Orange, 2006 , p. 15). Steve invited me into his relational \nworld of domination and subjugation by way of his icy cold identification with his \nterrorizing and terrifying mother, leading our way into extreme ideas about parenting \nand mothering. In this atmosphere, there seemed to be little capacity for empathy and \na persistent and rigid sense of profound contempt, disdain and aggression. But through \nempathic understanding of Steve’s experience and my own commitment to understand, 12\n D. SHARP"

With this emerging capacity to feel a sense of freedom and choice in his \nmost current relationships, Steve experiences his misophonia to be much less intrusive in \nhis day to day life. He is often struck by his newfound abilities to survive and shift out both \nthe pain of the misophonia and of his icy cold states.\nDonne tells us that “we must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the \nmisery of our neighbors . . . for affliction is a treasure . . . this bell that tells me of his \naffliction, digs out, and applies that gold to me: if by this consideration of another’s danger, \nI take mine own into contemplation, and so secure myself” (1623, p. 2). Through our work \ntogether, I had to breathe in the icy cold in Steve’s relational air—along with the pain and \nurgency of his misophonia. I had to witness it, feel it—as Avgi Saketopoulou asserts, to \n“bend our will and resist the impulse to look away” (Saketopoulou, 2023 , p. 16). Yet we can \nnot simply join into sadomasochistic worlds and remain there, within the confines of love \ntied to aggression, invincibility, death and sacrifice. The treasure is found in surviving the \nchallenge—holding, containing and digesting our own feelings, expanding our own borders \nand territories, alarms and systems, making room to hold the pain, so that we ourselves can \nhold in mind new possibilities and emerging ways of relating and experiencing (Winnicott,  \n1969 ).\nHecker emphasizes that “This intensive emotional work of sorting out and arranging is \nmade possible because it is also being borne and shared . . . ” (Hecker, 1993 , p. 91). Donne \nunderstands this sharing as “something more” that he imagined could exist through a bi- \ndirectional, permeable connection with God. For psychoanalysts, this sharing is the “some -\nthing more” of the intersubjective field. As I gain more access to my own self-with-other \nrelational, socio-cultural and intergenerational history—my own experience in relational \nsystems of subjugation and domination and the terror they can evoke—the pain of mis-\nophonia and its demand for something new seems much less aggressive, terrifying, or just \nplain far away. Through this sense of connectedness, Steve’s experience of misophonia with \nall of its intensity and extremity was able to be transformed into something authentically \nunderstandable for both of us—truly as though “for whom the bell tolls” is for all of \nhumanity—for “thee”, and for me.\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nNotes on Contributor\nDayna Sharp is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in private practice in Haddonfield, NJ.
