      "text": "Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    \n \n   \n 2 Abstract  1 \nMisophonia is a disorder involving sensitivity to certain sounds and related stimuli. Here, we 2 \nexplore the relationship between misophonia and affective flexibility, which describes cognitive 3 \nshifting abilities in the face of emotion -evoking stimuli. Previous evidence suggests impaired 4 \nsubjective cognitive flexibility in misophonia, but this relationship has not been confirmed 5 \nbehaviourally or in emotionally -salient contexts. The secondary aim of this study is to test the 6 \npotential association between misophonia and cognitive flexibility, building upon findings from 7 \nprevious research. The third objective is to examine the relationship between misophonia and 8 \nrumination, a maladaptive cognitive process characterized by repetitive negative thinking and 9 \nlinked to both cognitive and affective inflexibility. One hundred and forty participants  completed 10 \nthe recently developed Memory and Affective Flexibility Task (MAFT), designed to assess affective 11 \nflexibility, as well as a battery of self -report measures to evaluate misophonia severity, cognitive 12 \nflexibility and rumination. Results suggested an inverse relationship between affective flexibility 13 \nas measured by switch accuracy, but not reaction time, and misophonia severity. Cognitive 14 \nflexibility was also inversely associated with misophonia severity, but notably did not attribute to 15 \ntask-based affective flexibility, suggesting two independent constructs both involved in 16 \nmisophonia manifestation. Rumination associated positively with misophonia severity and 17 \ninversely with cognitive flexibility, but not affective flexibility. Taken together, these findings 18 \nhighlight a unique cognitive profile of misophonia, characterized by rigidity at the psychological 19 \nlevel through cognitive inflexibility and rumination, as well as at the executive -function level in 20 \nterms of affective switching difficulties.  21 \n 22 \nKeywords: Misophonia , affective flexibility , cognitive flexibility, rumination  23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 26 \n 27 \n 28 \n 29 \n 30 \n 31 \n 32 \n 33 \n 34 \n 35 \n 36 \n 37 \n 38 \n 39 \n 40 \n 41"

      "text": "Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    \n \n   \n 3 Introduction  1 \nMisophonia is a disorder characterized by decreased tolerance to certain sounds, such as 2 \norofacial (e.g., chewing or sniffing), non -orofacial but human -based (e.g., knuckle  cracking ), or 3 \ninnocuous  environmental  sounds (e.g., clock ticking) . Among individuals with misophonia , these  4 \ntrigger sounds , and sometimes also visual (misokinesia) or other related sensory stimuli, evoke 5 \nstrong emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, disgust, and (anticipatory) anxiety  (Swedo et 6 \nal., 2022) . These emotional reactions are accompanied by autonomic nervous system arousal 7 \n(Edelstein et al., 2013; Oszczapinska et al., 2024)  and altered neural activity in areas including 8 \nthose related to emotion processing , the salience of sensory stimuli , and motor control  (Kumar 9 \net al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2017; Schroder et al., 2019) . Resulting behavioural  responses, such as 10 \naggression, anger outbursts and avoidance, often cause significant impairment in daily life, 11 \nespecially in the case of more severe misophonia  (Brout et al., 2018) . Despite prevalence 12 \nestimates ranging from 4.6%  to 20% (Dixon et al., 2024; Vitoratou et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2014; 13 \nZhou et al., 2017) , research on misophonia , especially its treatment , is still at its early stages  14 \n(Rosenthal et al., 2023; Swedo et al., 2022)  15 \nEvidence  has highlighted the presence of executive functioning deficits in individuals with 16 \nmisophonia  in areas such as  cognitive  control,  response bias, emotion regulation and attention al 17 \nprocessing  (Daniels et al., 2020; Eijsker et al., 2019; Guetta et al., 2022; Murphy et al., 2024; 18 \nSimner et al., 2021) . Those affected often show a tendency to hyper -focus on certain bothersome 19 \nsounds (misophonic triggers) and face significant challenges in shiftin g attention away from th ese 20 \nstimuli (Edelstein et al., 2013; Jager et al., 2020) . They show selective attention deficits in 21 \nresponse to trigger sounds as well as hypervigilant anticipation , including anticipatory 22 \nanxiety  (Murphy et al., 2024; Sanchez & Silva, 2018) . This pattern may reflect deficits in 23 \nattentional set-shifting , a core feature of cognitive inflexibility , which is defined as the inability to 24 \ndisengage  from irrelevant stimuli and redirect attention to information relevant to the task or 25 \nsituation at hand (Horning & Davis, 2012; Uddin, 2021) . In support of this idea, there is evidence 26 \nof higher self -reported cognitive inflexibility among those with misophonia (Simner et al., 2021) . 27 \nCognitive flexibility, which facilitates  efficient shift ing between mental processes to 28 \nproduce contextually appropriate behavioural  responses, follows a protracted developmental 29 \ntrajectory and is frequently impaired in numerous common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric 30 \ndisorders  (Dajani & Uddin, 2015; Morris & Mansell, 2018) , includ ing obsessive -compulsive 31 \ndisorder (OCD ) (Gruner & Pittenger, 2017) , anorexia nervosa (AN ) (Miles et al., 2020) , autism 32 \nspectrum disorder (ASD ) (Albein -Urios et al., 2018; Lage et al., 2023) , Post -Traumatic Stress 33 \nDisorder (PTSD) (Popescu et al., 2023) , and a ttention -deficit and hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) 34 \n(Zhang et al., 2023) . Misophonia shows substantive comorbidity with these conditions, and the 35 \npresence of such comorbidities relate to severity of misophonia as well  (Andermane, Bauer, 36 \nSimner, et al., 2023; Erfanian et al., 2019; Kluckow et al., 2014; Rinaldi et al., 2023; Rouw & 37 \nErfanian, 2018; Wu et al., 2014) . The occurrence  of these symptoms  suggests potential overlap 38 \nof neurobiological or psychological mechanisms , and cognitive flexibility is one such candidate 39 \nmechanism.  40 \nIt remains , however , unclear whether cognitive inflexibility in misophonia manifests 41 \nprimarily in the face of triggers vs. across a broad range of contexts. There are some indications 42"

      "text": "Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    \n \n   \n 4 that the cognitive inflexibility may be broad. For instance, misophonia symptoms are associated 1 \nwith a greater aversion to expectation violation in social contexts, suggesting a broader inflexible 2 \napplication of social standards to others’ behaviour  (Banker et al., 2022) . Furthermore, 3 \nmisophonia has repeatedly been associated with perfectionism (Jager et al., 2020; Jakubovski et 4 \nal., 2022) , which is a process associated with cognitive inflexibility, characterized by a  rigid  pursuit 5 \nof unrealistic personal goals and standards  (Egan et al., 2011) . In other words, perfectionism may 6 \ncontribute to misophonia by fostering a tendency to inflexibly identify with negative self -views  7 \nwhen self-imposed standards are not met (Nguyen & Morris, 2024) . Perfectionists show  an 8 \nattentional bias that directs greater focus toward negative information than positive information  9 \n(Shafran et al., 2002) . In the context of misophonia, this translates to an intensified focus on 10 \nnegatively perceived sounds  (Simner et al., 2021) . These findings may reflect cognitive inflexibility 11 \namong individuals with misophonia that extends beyond contexts specifically associated with 12 \ntriggering stimuli.  13 \nTask -Based correlates of cognitive flexibility in misophonia  14 \nTo understand cognitive flexibility in misophonia, it is crucial to examine whether  deficits 15 \nshown on self -report data can also be reflected in a neurocognitive task. Self-report data may not 16 \naccurately capture deficits in executive  functioning as they tend to emphasize personality -level 17 \ntraits of flexibility rather than task -specific performance  (Buchanan, 2016) . In this respect, 18 \nbehavioural studies have yet to establish a consistent link between task -based cognitive flexibility 19 \nand misophonia . For instance,  despite reduced cognitive flexibility reported  in questionnaire s 20 \n(Simner et al., 2021) , individuals  with misophonia  do not appear to perform differently on the 21 \nWisconsin  Card Sorting Task  (WCST)  (Abramovitch et al., 2023) , a task in which perseverative 22 \nresponses/perseverative errors are often considered to reflect cognitive inflexibility  (Miles et al., 23 \n2021) . This discrepancy may stem from inconsistent definitions of cognitive inflexibility, as well as 24 \nmethodological and reporting biases, which likely underlie  lack of connection  between self - 25 \nreported measures of cognitive flexibility and performance on neuropsychological tasks . In 26 \naddition, self -report measures  may  not be reliable  proxies for neuropsychological tasks of 27 \ncognitive flexibility  (Howlett et al., 2021) . As such ,  the self -reported cognitive flexibility among 28 \nthose with miso phonia (Simner et al., 2021)  may not inform  the extent  to which  individuals with 29 \nmisophonia show impairments in set shifting  or task switching , core components  intricately linked 30 \nto cognitive flexibility (Dajani & Uddin, 2015; Stemme et al., 2007) .  31 \nAffective Flexibility in Misophonia: Cognitive Flexibility in Emotional 32 \nContexts  33 \nAnother  possible reason for the previous null findings regarding task -based cognitive 34 \nflexibility in individuals affected by misophonia, would be that cognitive inflexibility is evoked only 35 \nin the presence  of triggers  (e.g.,  orofacial sounds)  or other relevant stimuli . For instance, the 36 \nassociation between impaired cognitive control and misophonia severity was specific to 37 \nperformance  on the Stroop task in the presence of misophonia trigger  sounds , with misophonia 38 \nseverity not relating to Stroop effect when faced with sounds considered to be generally 39"

This could indicat e that specific executive functioning deficits 1 \nmay only be present in certain contexts among individuals  with misophonia .  2 \nFurther, t he WCST contains only neutral stimuli , which we hypothesize may not be 3 \nsufficient to evoke impairments in shifting or switching abilities in misophonic people.  4 \nConsidering the role of emotion regulation deficit s in misophonia (Dixon et al., 2024; Guetta et 5 \nal., 2022) , emotionally  evocative stimuli could be necessary to evoke significant inflexibility in 6 \nbehavioural  responding during a task by individuals with misophonia.   The potential importance 7 \nof affective stimuli to evoking flexibility deficits can be shown by drawing parallels with previous 8 \nresearch in ASD, which has shown a relationship with misophonia in the form of heightened 9 \npresence of autistic traits  (Rinaldi et al., 2023) . Task-switching paradigms revealed that switch 10 \ncosts associated with autism were specific to trials involving switching attention either to or away 11 \nfrom emotional stimuli, with directional findings referring to variations in these costs based on 12 \nthe direction of the shift. In other words, these costs differ by direction, reflecting distinct 13 \ncognitive processes engaged by emotional salience (De Vries & Geurts, 2012; Latinus et al., 2019) . 14 \nCognitive  flexibility in response to emotion -evoking stimuli is referred to as affective  flexibility 15 \n(Eckart et al., 2021) . Hence i n the present study, we use a novel neurocognitive task, the Memory 16 \nand Affective Flexibility Task (Allen et al., Under review)  that incorporates neutral and 17 \nemotionally -arousing  stimuli in working memory and affective flexibility trials  (Lang & Bradley, 18 \n2007) .  19 \nRumination: A key process related to inflexibility potentially involved in 20 \nmisophonia  21 \nRumination is recognized as a transdiagnostic process associated with cognitive and 22 \naffective inflexibility (Altamirano et al., 2010; Davis & Nolen -Hoeksema, 2000; Genet et al., 2013; 23 \nMorris & Mansell, 2018) . Defined as repetitive, self -focused thought related to  negative emotions 24 \nand their origins, rumination is pervasive across a range of psychiatric disorders  (Treynor et al., 25 \n2003) . Inherently rigid and maladaptive, r umination involves cycling through the same negative 26 \nthoughts  without transitioning to more adaptive cognitive approaches . Inflexibility may manifest 27 \nin rumination through  deficits  in the ability to di sengage  from negative emotional elements of 28 \nstimuli , resulting in  difficulty shifting focus from negative to neutral or positive cognitions (Genet 29 \net al., 2013; Koster et al., 2011) . In misophonia, rumination may manifest as inflexible, repetitive 30 \nnegative thinking, not only about trigger stimuli and their sources but also involving internally 31 \nfocused thoughts, such as judgments about the misophonic reaction itself. Misophonic 32 \nindividuals  tend to  ruminate even when no triggers are present, such as by anticipating what 33 \ntrigger sounds may come next or replaying previous triggering situations (Vitoratou et al., 2021) . 34 \nAlthough people with misophonia do anecdotally report rumination surrounding their 35 \nmisophonic experience , it remains unclear to what extent ruminati ve thinking  is pervasive in 36 \nbroader contexts as an overarching cognitive tendency  in people with misophonia . Thus, In the 37 \ncurrent investigation, we ask whether  this tendency to ruminate extends more generally to daily 38 \nlife, both about misophonia and other unrelated topics. We aim to explore rumination as a 39 \npotential manifestation of cognitive and affective inflexibility in misophonia, focusing here on 40 \nthree subtypes: perseverative thinking (Ehring et al., 2011) , brooding (Treynor et al., 2003) , and 41 \nanger rumination (Sukhodolsky et al., 2001) .  42"

The MAFT  is designed to  assess  affective flexibility , which may be relevant to 4 \nindividuals with misophonia  as well as broader psychopathology (Friedman & Banich, 2019) . We 5 \npredict an  association of self -reported misophonia severity with affective inflexibility, as indexed 6 \nby worse performance on the MAFT switch trials in terms of reduced accuracy  and slower 7 \nReaction T ime (RT) (H1).   8 \nIn addition, we examine the relationship between self -reported cognitive inflexibility and 9 \nthe severity of misophonia , expecting to replicate the findings of Simner et al.  (H2) and we predict 10 \na positive association between diminished cognitive flexibility and the severity of misophonia 11 \nsymptoms . Furthermore, we evaluate the association between self -reported cognitive inflexibility 12 \nand task -based indices of affective flexibility, specifically switch accuracy and switch RT , derived 13 \nfrom the MAFT  to examine whether self -report flexibility aligns with task -based measures . We 14 \nhypothesize that self -reported and task -based measures of flexibility w ill be positively correlated, 15 \nshowing  a convergence between cognitive and affective dimensions of flexibility  (H3). This 16 \ninvestigation aims to deepen understanding of the interplay between subjective and objective 17 \nfacets of flexibility and their relevance to misophonia severity.  18 \nAdditionally , we explore the association  between rumination , misophonia  severity , 19 \naffective  flexibility , given  affective  inflexibility , specifically the difficulty in disengaging from 20 \nprocessing the emotional aspect  of negative stimuli , has been linked to increased rumination in 21 \ndaily life  (Genet et al., 2013) . In particular , we  expect to find a positive relationship between 22 \nincreased self -reported rumination , and misophonia severity  as well as worse switch accuracy 23 \nand switch RT to correspond with greater levels of rumination  (H4). As part of our exploratory 24 \nanalyses, we also examine the relationship between cognitive flexibility and measures of 25 \nrumination. We hypothesize that decreased cognitive flexibility will be positively correlated with 26 \nincreased levels of rumination  (H5) . 27 \nMethod  28 \nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the Committee for Protection of Human 29 \nSubjects at the University of California, Berkeley  (CPHS protocol ID 2024 -01-17038).

Participants judged whether 3 \nthe current image matched or mismatched the image presented 1, 2, or 3 trials prior by pressing “A” for match and “L” for 4 \nmismatch. After each trial, participants received visual feedback indicating the accuracy of their response, displayed as either 5 \n“CORRECT” or “ERROR” on the screen.  In switch trials, they assessed the valence of emotional images (positive, negative or neutral) 6 \nfrom the International Affective Picture System (IAPS ) (Lang & Bradley, 2007) , pressing “K” for negative and “S” for positive . 7 \n 8 \nIn the MAFT , participants engaged in two types of trials: memory trials and emotional 9 \nswitch trials. Memory trials required participants to determine whether the current image 10 \nmatched one shown N trials earlier, measuring working memory. Emotional switch trials, 11 \nrandomly interspersed within the task, required participants to rapidly evaluate whether an 12 \nimage was positive or negative, measuring affective flexibility.

Neutral stimuli were predominantly classified as positive (M = 0.64 8 \n± 0.11), providing insight into the evaluation of stimuli without salient emotional content.  9 \nIn memory trials, participants responded by pressing “A” for a match and “L” for a 10 \nmismatch, while in switch trials, they judged emotional valence, pressing “K” for negative and “S” 11 \nfor positive. Recent findings suggest that RT may not be specific to trial type, as RT indices are 12 \nhighly correlated across tasks, indicating it may reflect general motor or cognitive processing 13 \nspeed rather than task -specific variables (Allen et al., Under review) . Although both accuracy and 14 \nRT were pre -registered for the switch task, recent evidence highlights accuracy as the more 15 \nmeaningful measure of affective flexibility; therefore, both metrics are reported here.  16 \nSelective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S -Five, (Vitoratou et al., 2021) )  17 \nMisophonia symptom severity was assessed using the 25 -item Selective Sound Sensitivity 18 \nSyndrome Scale (S -Five)  (Vitoratou et al., 2021) . The S -Five scale is designed to assess five 19 \ndifferent dimensions of misophonia severity: externalizing, internalizing, impact, threat, and 20 \noutburst , as well as overall severity . Participants are asked to  respond to questions (e.g. “The way 21 \nI react to certain sounds makes me wonder whether deep inside I am just a bad person” and “The 22 \nway I feel/react to certain sounds will eventually isolate me and prevent me from doing everyday 23 \nthings”) on a 10 -point scale, ranging from (0) for not at all true to (10) for completely true. The 24 \nmaximum possible score on the S -Five is 250.  A score of 87 or above indicate s significant 25 \nmisophonia as suggested by ROC analysis (Vitoratou et al., 2021) . The S -Five has previously 26 \nexhibited good internal consistency ( α >= 0.83) and strong test -retest reliability (ICC >= 0.86) for 27 \nall factors, as well as good convergent and discriminant validity.  In the  current study, the S -Five 28 \nshowed excellent internal consistency ( α = 0.96).  29 \nDetail and Flexibility Questionnaire (D flex, (Roberts et al., 2011) ) 30 \nThe 12 -item flexibility subscale of the Detail and Flexibility Questionnaire (DFlex) was 31 \nincluded as a self -report measure of cognitive inflexibility (Roberts et al., 2011) . In a previous 32 \nstudy, participants classified as having misophonia scored significantly higher for inflexibility on 33 \nthis questionnaire compared to those without misophonia (Simner et al., 2021) . Participants 34 \nrated each item (e.g., “I can be called stubborn or single minded as it is difficult to shift from one 35 \npoint of view to another”) on a 6 -point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly 36 \nAgree (6). Total scores range from 12 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater levels of 37 \ninflexibility. This scale has previously demonstrated very high internal consistency ( α = 0.93) as 38 \nwell as strong construct and discriminant validity.

RNT describes the 3 \ntransdiagnostic process of unproductive, repetitive thinking, and rumination is one form of RNT 4 \n(Ehring et al., 2011) . Participants were asked to rate how each of 15 statements applied to them 5 \nin terms of how they typically think about their negative experiences or problems. Participants 6 \nresponded using a 5 -point Likert scale, from Never (0) to Almost Always (4). Example statements 7 \ninclude “The same thoughts keep going through my mind again and again” and “I can’t do 8 \nanything else while thinking about my problems ”. The higher -order PTQ scale has previously 9 \nexhibited excellent internal consistency ( α = 0.94 - 0.95), as well as good internal consistency for 10 \nsubscales (Core Characteristics of RNT: α = 0.92 - 0.94; Unproductiveness of RNT: α = 0.77 - 0.87; 11 \nRNT Capturing Mental Capacity: α = 0.82 - 0.90); satisfactory test -retest reliability (total score 12 \nretest correlation = 0.69), and good convergent validity (Ehring et al., 2011) . In the current sample, 13 \nthe higher -order PTQ scale also showed excellent internal consistency ( α = 0.95).  14 \nRuminative Responses Scale (RRS , (Treynor et al., 2003) ) 15 \nBrooding rumination was assessed using the 5 -item Brooding subscale of the Ruminative 16 \nResponses Scale (RRS -B), which is considered the maladaptive form of rumination and has been 17 \nimplicated in the development of psychiatric disorders, such as depressive symptoms  (Treynor et 18 \nal., 2003) . Participants responded using a 4 -point Likert scale ranging from Almost Never ( 1) to 19 \nAlmost Always (4), rating how often they engage with an indicated thought or mental behaviour  20 \nwhen down, sad, or depressed. Items included, for example, “Think ‘What am I doing to deserve 21 \nthis?’” or “Think about a recent situation, wishing it had gone better.” This scale has demonstrated 22 \nacceptable reliability ( α = 0.77) with a test -retest correlation of 0.62 in previous research (Treynor 23 \net al., 2003) . In the current sample, the RRS -B showed good internal consistency ( α = 0.81).  24 \nAnger Rumination Scale (ARS , (Sukhodolsky et al., 2001) ) 25 \nAnger rumination was assessed using the Anger Rumination Scale (ARS) (Sukhodolsky et 26 \nal., 2001) . The ARS comprises 19 items designed to measure the inclination to mentally engage 27 \nwith past episodes or feelings of anger. Participants are asked to rate each of the 19 items on a 28 \nLikert  scale ranging from Almost Never (1) to Almost Always (4), with higher scores indicating 29 \nheightened anger rumination. Example items include statements like \"Memories of even minor 30 \nannoyances bother me for a while\" and “I re -enact the anger episode in my mind after it has 31 \nhappened.”  The ARS includes four subscales: angry afterthoughts, thoughts of revenge, angry 32 \nmemories, and understanding of causes. The ARS has previously exhibited adequate internal 33 \nconsistency, test -retest reliability, as well as both convergent and divergent validity (Sukhodolsky 34 \net al., 2001) .

Participants are asked to rate how 1 \noften they are bothered by the problems described in each item, with statements such as “Feeling 2 \nnervous, anxious or on edge” and “Feeling down, depressed or hopeless.” In previous research, 3 \nthe SAD -T has shown good internal consistency ( α = 0.91) and satisfactory ITC values between 4 \n0.76 and 0.84 (Aazh et al., 2024) . In the current sample, the SAD -T showed excellent internal 5 \nconsistency ( α = 0.90).   6 \nSound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ,  (Aazh & Kula, Under review) ) 7 \nThe Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ) is a 6 -item questionnaire designed 8 \nto measure symptoms of abnormal sound intolerance, specifically hyperacusis and misophonia. 9 \nParticipants are asked to rate how often each of the statements apply to them, with scores on 10 \neach item ranging from 0 to 3, corresponding  to different frequency intervals (e.g. 0 to 1, 2 to 6,7 11 \nto 10, and 11 to 14 days). Example statements include “Pain in your ears when hearing certain 12 \nloud sounds? Examples: loud music, sirens, motorcycles, building work, lawn mower, train 13 \nstations” and “Fear that certain sounds may make your hearing and/or tinnitus worse?”. Total 14 \nscores range from 0 to 18, with a total score of 4 considered to be the threshold for presence of 15 \nsound sensitivity (Aazh et al., 2024) . We included this measure to control for symptoms of 16 \nhyperacusis, which has a high rate of co -occurrence with misophonia (Ahmmed & Vijayakumar, 17 \n2024; Andermane, Bauer, Sohoglu, et al., 2023) . The previous version of SSSQ , which had 5 items , 18 \nhas shown good internal consistency ( α = 0.87) as well as convergent and construct validity (Aazh 19 \net al., 2024). Here we utilized a new version with 6 items , which based on data from the authors  20 \nshowed a good Cronbach alpha estimate ( 𝛼 = 0.80), acceptable McDonald’s ω with values of 0.80, 21 \nand test -retest reliability with an r -value of 0.81 well above Cohen`s suggested threshold for high 22 \ncorrelation. In the current sample, the 6 -item version  showed acceptable internal consistency ( α 23 \n= 0.7 7) as well as when removing item -4 (which measures misophonia) from the scale ( α = 0.71).  24 \nProcedure  25 \nWe first recruited participants through Prolific ( www.prolific.com ), an academic research - 26 \nfocused crowdsourcing platform. Eligibility criteria as screened using the demographic pre -screen 27 \nfeature on Prolific included age of 18 -45, since individuals within this age range generally have 28 \nsimilar audiological profiles, allowing control for hearing impairment/other periphery issues (Lee 29 \net al., 2012) ; no hearing loss or hearing difficulties; absence of cognitive impairment or dementia, 30 \nnormal or corrected -to-normal vision; fluency in English, and willingness to be exposed to 31 \ndistressing stimuli, considering the graphic nature of images included in the MAFT task. In 32 \naddition, although no formal screening was used for comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, this was 33 \nincluded as an exclusion criterion in the study ad vert and consent form (phrased as “No current 34 \npsychiatric diagnosis or cognitive impairment” in the eligibility section).  35 \nEligible participants based on Prolific pre -screen filter  were shown a study advert briefly 36 \ndescribing the procedures  and also stating the compensation amount of $6.73 total USD  (~ €6.56  37 \nor ~ £5.51) . This compensation amount is equivalent to an estimated rate of $9.58 per hour (~ 38 \n€9.34 or ~ £7.85) based on the median completion time of 42 .06 min. Two participants, recruited 39 \nfrom Prolific during the pilot stage of the study, were compensated in the approximate GBP 40 \nequivalent to 6.73 USD based on the conversion rate at the time of the study.  41"

Those potential participants were sent the same study description and 3 \ninclusion/ exclusion criteria used in the Prolific advert. Those who expressed interest were 4 \ndirected to a Qualtrics pre -screen survey to assess the same criteria (with identical wording of 5 \nquestions used to filter Prolific participants ). Volunteer participants recruited from newsletters 6 \nwere not compensated for their time  and were made aware of this before participation . This 7 \nlimitation arose from the requirement to exchange identifiable information, such as PayPal 8 \naccount details, which posed privacy and confidentiality concerns.  9 \nAll participants were directed via URL to Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com ) to provide 10 \ninformed consent.  This involved a description of the nature of images they might encounter 11 \nduring the MAFT task  and participants were required to indicate their willingness to proceed 12 \nknowing they would be exposed to such images. Upon providing consent, participants were 13 \nredirected from Qualtrics to complete the Memory and Affective Flexibility Task via Inquisit Web 14 \nversion 6.6.1 ( www.millisecond.com ).  15 \nAfter completing the MAFT , participants were directed back to Qualtrics, where they re - 16 \nentered their subject ID (Prolific -generated for Prolific participants, and Qualtrics -generated for 17 \nvolunteers), reported their age and gender, and then completed a battery of questionnaires  (e.g., 18 \nS-Five, rumination questionnaires , including the  ARS, PTQ , RRS-B, SSSQ, SAD -T, and DFlex ). Seven 19 \nattention checks were included in the questionnaire battery, with one per questionnaire, in an 20 \nInstructional Manipulation Checks format (e.g. “Please select ‘Often’ for this question”).  21 \nThe entire study, including both MAFT and all questionnaires, took an estimated 40 to 45 22 \nmins, with a median study completion time of ~42 mins. Upon adequate completion of the 23 \nbattery, Prolific -recruited participants were provided with a completion code and instructed to 24 \nreturn to Prolific to receive compensation through the platform. Participants failing two or more 25 \nattention checks received a custom code indicating failure and would have been requested to 26 \nreturn their submission without compensation; however, no participants failed based on this 27 \ncriterion  (Figure 3). Volunteer participants were not redirected upon completion, and the study 28 \nconcluded once they completed all components.  29 \nUpon completion, Prolific -recruited participants' self -reported demographic data became 30 \navailable for download via Prolific, with optional data first language, nationality, country of birth, 31 \nstudent status, and employment status. This data was matched to participants' Inquisit and 32 \nQualtrics data using Prolific ID; however, demographic data was not used for analysis purposes in 33 \nthe current study.  34 \nA total of 199 participants were recruited for the study, of whom 163 completed the 35 \nMAFT : 142 from Prolific and 21 from outreach to newsletters . We excluded participants who did 36 \nnot complete the MAFT in full (N = 20) or attempted the MAFT task multiple times before 37 \ncompletion ( N = 1), or did not complete the Qualtrics questionnaires in full despite completing 38 \nthe MAFT ( N = 2), leaving a final sample  size of 140  (Figu re 3) .

The dependent variables consisted of the S -Five total score and its five 4 \nsubscales. Possible confounding variables examined in the study were the total scores of the SSSQ 5 \nand SAD -T, as well as gender.  6 \nThe rationale behind controlling for hyperacusis as confounding variable was driven by the 7 \nheightened SSSQ scores, suggestive of hyperacusis, in participants with significant misophonia. 8 \nThis pattern persisted even after excluding the misophonia -specific item (item 4). This is 9 \nconsistent with previous findings of heightened comorbidity with audiological disorders like 10 \ntinnitus and hyperacusis (Aazh, Erfanian, et al., 2022) . However, misophonia can also occur 11 \nwithout audiological abnormalities (Swedo et al., 2022) . Thus, where warranted, we include 12 \nadditional tests for all primary hypotheses with the SSSQ as a covariate in order to control for 13 \nhyperacusis.  14 \nEvidence suggests that there is a high prevalence of depression and anxiety in individuals 15 \nwith misophonia (Aazh, Erfanian, et al., 2022; Danesh & Aazh, 2020; Erfanian et al., 2018; Erfanian 16 \net al., 2019; Erfanian & Rouw, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; McKay et al., 2018; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018; 17 \nSiepsiak et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2014) . Hence, we also control for depression and anxiety by 18 \nincorporating the SAD -T score as a covariate in each regression model . 19 \nData Analytic Plan  20 \nPre-processing  21 \nWe pre -processed  MAFT  data using Pytho n (Foundation, 2022) , consistent with the 22 \nmethods of (Allen et al., Under review) . All further statistical analyses were conducted using R 23 \nversion 4.3.1 (Team, 2023)  and MATLAB 2019b (MATLAB, 2019)  with an alpha set at 0.05. Bivariate 24 \nPearson  correlations were calculated for all measures to assess overlap and correlations between 25 \nvariables.  26 \nImplausibly fast responses (< 200 ms) and missed responses (> 4500 ms), where 27 \nparticipants were only allowed to register a response within the 4500 ms trial period, were 28 \nexcluded. Following the approach outlined in (Allen et al., Under review) , trial-level outlier RTs 29 \nwith Z-scores > |3| were trimmed. Participants with a switch omission rate exceeding 0.5 were 30 \nalso excluded from analysis.  31 \nAcross other measures , we reviewed outliers  > 3 SD. These outliers (S -Five: two 32 \nparticipants > 3 SD above the mean total score; ARS: one participant >  3 SD above the mean, and 33 \none < 3 SD below the mean) were retained in the data as they likely reflected natural variation, 34 \nnot measurement error. However, primary analyses were conducted both with and without 35 \noutliers for comparison purposes to ensure consistency of findings.  36 \nParticipants were categorized as experiencing clinical  misophonia using a threshold score 37 \nof 87 indicating significant  misophonia (Vitoratou et al., 2023) . Group differences were analysed  38 \nusing Χ² tests for nominal variables and Welch t -tests for continuous variables. Due to a significant 39 \ndifference in gender ratio between groups, primary analyses were repeated with gender as a 40 \ncovariate to ensure consistency.   41"

In essence, cognitive flexibility 5 \nmay buffer the detrimental impact of certain types of rumination, highlighting the need for a 6 \nnuanced understanding of its interaction with cognitive and emotional processes in the context 7 \nof misophonia.  8 \nDiscussion  9 \nIn the current work, we extend previous research on cognitive inflexibility in mis ophonia  10 \nin several ways.  First, we conjointly considered a self -report measure of broad cognitive flexibility, 11 \ntogether with a behavioural  measure of affective flexibility.  Second, we considered how 12 \nmisophonia and cognitive inflexibility related to multiple forms of rumination .  Third, throughout 13 \nour analyses, we considered multiple dimensions of misophonia symptoms.  Consistent with 14 \nhypotheses, we  demonstrate d that affective flexibility, limited to  switch accuracy, was inversely  15 \nassociated with misophonia  severity and internalization , impact and outburst  factors . We also 16 \nobserved that cognitive inflexibility was significantly associated with  the severity of misophonia 17 \nand these findings generalized across misophonia subscales , except for  internalization.  Consistent 18 \nwith previous work, we found that cognitive flexibility and affective flexibility were separable, 19 \nwith no significant correlation between these indices.  Furthermore, our findings reveal ed that 20 \nvarious types  of rumination, including perseverative thinking , brooding,  and anger -related 21 \nrumination, were  associated  with misophonia severity  and cognitive inflexibility but not affective 22 \ninflexibility.   23 \n Taken together, t hese findings imply  that the mechanisms of misophonia may not be 24 \nspecific to sound triggers. Instead, misophonia appears to involve a complex interplay of cognitive 25 \nand emotional processes, which may contribute to the heightened sensitivity and exaggerated 26 \nresponsivity to specific auditory stimuli. That is, we observed reduced  task-switching accuracy 27 \nwhen faced with  emotion -evoking stimuli that were unrelated to auditory  triggers , which 28 \nsuggests the broader cognitive affective contributors to this condition , beyond reactions 29 \nspecifically linked  to misophonic triggers.  Findings also highlight the potential role of maladaptive 30 \nemotional regulation strategies, such as rumination, in the path ology of misophonia . Overall, our 31 \nfindings emphasize  the need to consider cognitive and affective processes in understanding this 32 \ncondition.  33 \nSwitching to affective stimuli: Greater challenges linked to increased misophonia 34 \nsymptom severity  35 \nTo provide evidence of affective flexibility  deficits in individuals with misophonia , we 36 \nemployed a  newly developed task designed to capture affective  switching .

RT performance was not related to misophonia, and 1 \nthis is consistent with early evidence that RTs on this task are not specific to affective flexibility 2 \nbut tend to reflect a more  general motor response rate across conditions (Allen et al., Under 3 \nreview) . The diminished affective flexibility may hamper the ability to effectively  switch  4 \nresponding  to demands  in the face of emotional stimuli . This finding is in line with previous 5 \nstudies which highlight the role of emotion regulation in misophonia (Bagrowska et al., 2022; 6 \nBarahmand et al., 2023; Cassiello -Robbins et al., 2020; Dixon et al., 2024; Guetta et al., 2022) . 7 \nSimilar patterns have been revealed  in individuals with high autistic traits , overlapping 8 \nwith misophonia symptoms  (Ertuerk et al., 2023; Rinaldi et al., 2023) , who show greater switch 9 \ncosts  (worse accuracy) , suggesting potential links between cognitive inflexibility and the 10 \nexpression of autistic traits  (Zhou et al., 2024) . Two broad, mutually inclusive classes of 11 \nexplanation can be distinguished  to account for the increased switch costs observed in individuals 12 \nwith misophonia. The Task -Set Reconfiguration (TSR) Theory (Rogers & Monsell, 1995)  posits that 13 \nswitch costs arise from the cognitive effort required to reconfigure a new task set during switch 14 \ntrials, a process reliant on endogenous, top -down control mechanisms  (Zhou et al., 2024) . 15 \nEvidence suggests that cognitive control, a mechanism that facilitates task reconfiguration, is 16 \nimpaired in individuals with misophonia when confronted with trigger sounds that are necessary 17 \nfor reconfiguring the task (Daniels et al., 2020) . In addition, effective cognitive control is crucial  18 \nfor deploying response inhibition when needed, such as restraining automatic but contextually 19 \ninappropriate behaviours , like anger outbursts in response to trigger sounds. Altered response 20 \ninhibition related to misophonia also has been observed using the stop -signal task, revealing a 21 \nbias toward longer stop -signal delays (Eijsker et al., 2019) . According to this framework, the larger 22 \nemotion switch costs observed individuals with misophonia  may reflect difficulties in 23 \nreconfiguring the emotional task set.  24 \nAlternatively, the Task -Set Inertia (TSI) Theory (Allport & Wylie, 1999; Meiran, 2008; 25 \nWaszak et al., 2003; Wylie & Allport, 2000)  asserts that switch costs arise from interference 26 \ncaused by residual activation of previous task sets. From this perspective, the larger emotion 27 \nswitch costs in misophonic individuals  may indicate greater susceptibility to interference from 28 \nprior task sets when transitioning to an emotional task.  Both task -set inertia and task -set 29 \nreconfiguration are thought to jointly contribute to the increased emotion switch costs  30 \n(Vandierendonck et al., 2010) . 31 \nThe reduced affective flexibility in misophonia can also be better understood by  the neural 32 \ncorrelates of misophonia. Inhibition is essential for set -switching  within  affective flexibility , 33 \nfacilitating the shift between behaviour, emotion or cognitive  process or task sets by suppressing 34 \ncompeting or irrelevant ones and minimizing interference during the transition  (Arbuthnott & 35 \nFrank, 2000) . Elevated orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activity has been documented  during successful, 36 \nas opposed to failed, behavioural  inhibition, highlighting its role in regulatory control processes  37 \n(Deng et al., 2017) . In individuals with misophonia, the OFC exhibits hyperactivation specifically 38 \nin response to trigger stimuli. This heightened activity suggests the critical role of OFC in 39 \nfacilitating functional synchronization among brain regions, potentially influencing the 40 \nmisophonic ‘response’ as reflected in behavioural  task performance (Cerliani & Rouw, 2020) .  41"

These findings 3 \nimpl y a broader contextual rigidity in misophonia, extending beyond specific behavioural  4 \nresponses.  Such rigidity has been observed in other overlapping psychiatric and 5 \nneurodevelopmental disorder s (Geurts et al., 2009; Gruner & Pittenger, 2017; Miles et al., 2020; 6 \nMurphy et al., 2012)  with high co-morbidity with misophonia (Erfanian et al., 2019; Erfanian & 7 \nRouw, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018) .  8 \nCognitive inflexibility in misophonia may account for heightened sensitivity to norm 9 \nviolations in uncontrollable conditions  (Banker et al., 2022) , reflecting a diminished ability to 10 \nadapt to environmental deviations or unpredictability  (Miyake et al., 2000)  and to flexibly adjust 11 \ncognitive strategies to manage change (Han et al., 2012) . Similar to individuals with autism, those 12 \nwith  cognitive inflexibility often resist change and struggle to shift their mental frameworks or 13 \nexpectations, leading to a rigid adherence to established norms (Lacroix et al., 2024) . 14 \nConsequently, when faced with uncontrollable situations that deviate from these norms, their 15 \ndifficulty in adapting results in heightened sensitivity and an amplified reaction to perceived 16 \nviolations (Norena, 2024) . This rigidity intensifies discomfort and limits their ability to 17 \ncontextualize or tolerate variability  18 \nAlthough mental rigidity, attributed to misophonia, is likely a key explanation for the 19 \ntendency to over -attend or hyperfocus in response to misophonic triggers (Edelstein et al., 2013; 20 \nJager et al., 2020; Simner et al., 2021) , it may also represent an underlying pathological 21 \nmechanism that contributes to broader perceptual and behavioural  deficits.  To advance the field  22 \nand explore whether the behavioural  symptoms are underpinned by the rigidity or rigidity should 23 \nbe considered per se  as a symptom , experimental measures must evolve to reflect mechanistic 24 \nmodels of flexibility deficits.   25 \nThe severity of misophonia is linked to elevated rumination tendencies  26 \nBuilding on the robust evidence linking cognitive flexibility and rumination across various 27 \npsychopathological conditions, we delved into the potential association of misophonia with three  28 \nforms of rumination (Altan -Atalay et al., 2022; Davis & Nolen -Hoeksema, 2000; Genet et al., 2013; 29 \nLei et al., 2022; Miles et al., 2023; Owens & Derakshan, 2013) . All three forms of rumination were 30 \nmoderately associated with misophonia severity,  and t hese relationships remained significant 31 \neven after controlling for depression, anxiety and hyperacusis . This finding  impl ies that the 32 \nrelationship between rumination and misophonia severity  cannot be explained by the presence 33 \nof these comorbid symptoms. Although  rumination is a hallmark feature of depressive and 34 \nanxiety disorders  (Ruscio et al., 2015) , both of which frequently co -occur with misophonia  35 \n(Erfanian et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019; Erfanian & Rouw, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; Rosenthal 36 \net al., 2022; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018) , our findings emphasize  the unique connection  between 37 \nrumination and misophonia severity .  38 \nAnecdotal reports, consistent with our findings, indicate that individuals with misophonia 39 \nemploy internal coping strategies. These strategies involve cognitive processing of trigger 40 \ncharacteristics, anger rumination, and contemplation of emotional responses associated with 41 \nmisophonia, aimed at avoiding or escaping triggers (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023) . 42"

First , the in ability to mentally 2 \nswitch between cognitive sets may lead to  perseveration  (Altan -Atalay et al., 2022; Beckwé et al., 3 \n2014; Nolen -Hoeksema, 2000; Watkins & Brown, 2002) . Second, s imilar to  mood disorders, the 4 \nruminati ve tendencies  observed in misophonia could  reflect disturbances in cognitive switching 5 \nprocesses  (Piguet et al., 2010) , leading to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies that are less 6 \neffective in the moment  (Barahmand et al., 2023; Cassiello -Robbins et al., 2020; Dixon et al., 2024; 7 \nErfanian et al., 2018; Guetta et al., 2022; Rinaldi et al., 2023; Spencer et al., 2023) .  8 \nIt is important to note that we were not able to disentangle the conjoint effects  of 9 \ncognitive flexibility vs. rumination  in relation to misophonia.  All forms of  rumination  and 10 \ncognitive inflexibility overlap in their relationship with  misophonia . Previous research supports 11 \nthe bidirectional effects of cognitive flexibility and rumination (De Lissnyder et al., 2012) . For 12 \ninstance, i n the context of AN, which shows  high comorbidity with misophonia , evidence suggests 13 \nthat eating disorder -specific rumination acts as a mediator between subjective cognitive 14 \nflexibility and eating disorder symptoms  (Miles et al., 2023) .  15 \nAll in all, as we measured  multiple forms of ruminatio n and focused on general tendencies 16 \nof responding to distress rather than misophonia -specific  experiences , our findings demonstrate  17 \nthat a tendency toward perseverative thought in misophonia extends beyond trigger -related 18 \nsituation s. Fortunately, perseverative thought such as rumination can be targeted in treatment  19 \nthrough therap y modalities  such as CBT   (Querstret & Cropley, 2013) , which ha s shown promise 20 \nin managing misophonia symptoms  (I. J. Jager et al., 2020) . 21 \nConclusion  22 \nThis study provides novel evidence  that the severity of misophonia is related to affective 23 \ninflexibility , cognitive inflexibility, and perseverate  thinking. Affective inflexibility  was distinct to 24 \ncognitive inflexibility and perseverative  thinking, as no significant association was observed with 25 \nmeasures of these constructs . These findings provide insights into the rich set of affective  and 26 \ncognitive dimensions involved in misophonia .  The profile of affective and cognitive difficulties 27 \nobserved  here are well -documented as transdiagnostic risk variables, consistent with the 28 \ndiagnostic overlap of misophonia with conditions such as ASD and OCD. By delineating these 29 \ncharacteristics, the study contributes to reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and enhances our 30 \nunderstanding of thee cognitive and affective processes involved in misophonia.  Importantly, 31 \nthis research offers practical implications for clinical practice, encouraging a more targeted 32 \napproach to treatment protocols that emphasise addressing the cognitive aspects of misophonia.  33 \nAcknowledgement  34 \nThis study was generously funded by the University of California, Berkeley  Undergraduate 35 \nResearch Apprentice Program (URAP ) and the SoQuiet Misophonia Student Research Grant  36 \n(https://www.soquiet.org/grants ).
