  "abstract": "Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to speci c sounds or stimuli associated with such sounds, called triggers. The aim was to validate a questionnaire on self-perception of the type of sound, visual identi cation, and origin of sounds in adults with suspected misophonia by Spanish-speaking people. An interview was conducted with a total of 395 participants, divided into four distinct blocks of questions: the trigger of misophonia, the visual identi cation of gestures or actions related to selective sounds, the emotional closeness between listener and sender, and the impact on the daily personal relationships of the person with misophonia. Each block used classical test theory to factorially validate the instrument. The rst group of questions gave as a result four factors: mouth and throat sounds, environmental sounds, material sounds, and pronunciation sounds (Cronbach's alpha = 0.929; KMO = 0.894). The second group identi ed two dimensions of reaction to actions and gestures, one related to movements of the mouth and throat and the second to body movements or exaggerated gesticulation (Cronbach's alpha = 0.840; KMO = 0.819). The third block linked low and high emotional closeness factors (Cronbach's alpha = 0.690; KMO = 0.633). The fourth block obtained a factor for daily chores and another for a ective relationships (Cronbach's alpha = 0.861; KMO = 0.820). The questionnaire o ers valuable insights into the nature of misophonia, and the necessity for further research in this eld. These ndings emphasize the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of misophonia to enhance diagnosis.",

The\naim was to validate a questionnaire on self-perception of the type of sound, visual identi\fcation, and origin of sounds in adults\nwith suspected misophonia by Spanish-speaking people. An interview was conducted with a total of 395 participants, divided\ninto four distinct blocks of questions: the trigger of misophonia, the visual identi\fcation of gestures or actions related to selective\nsounds, the emotional closeness between listener and sender, and the impact on the daily personal relationships of the person\nwith misophonia. Each block used classical test theory to factorially validate the instrument. The \frst group of questions\ngave as a result four factors: mouth and throat sounds, environmental sounds, material sounds, and pronunciation sounds\n(Cronbach's alpha = 0.929; KMO = 0.894). The second group identi\fed two dimensions of reaction to actions and gestures,\none related to movements of the mouth and throat and the second to body movements or exaggerated gesticulation (Cronbach's\nalpha = 0.840; KMO = 0.819). The third block linked low and high emotional closeness factors (Cronbach's alpha = 0.690;\nKMO = 0.633). The fourth block obtained a factor for daily chores and another for a\u000bective relationships (Cronbach's alpha\n= 0.861; KMO = 0.820). The questionnaire o\u000bers valuable insights into the nature of misophonia, and the necessity for further\nresearch in this \feld. These \fndings emphasize the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of misophonia to\nenhance diagnosis.\nAppendix 2\nThe measures of item relevance in each of their respective block.\nBlock KMO Item Chonbach's alpha Factor Chonbach's alpha Reliability if an item is dropped Item total correlation\nBlock 1 Block 1 Block 1 Block 1 Block 1 Block 1\nRepetitive noises (pencil playing, foot tapping/keyboard) 0.96 0.93 0.91 0.93 0.54\nPeople eating with their mouths open 0.91 0.93 0.93 0.63\nCrunchy noises when eating 0.90 0.93 0.93 0.54\nPeople who inhale hard 0.94 0.93 0.92 0.67\nPeople who sip liquids 0.94 0.93 0.92 0.64\nPeople who sni\u000b 0.93 0.92 0.92 0.70\nPeople who swallow hard 0.95 0.93 0.92 0.67\nPeople, who cough, clear their throat. and/or sneeze 0.93 0.93 0.92 0.67\nMusic of others or that is not to my complete liking 0.90 0.93 0.86 0.93 0.41\nVehicle noises (engine, horn) 0.91 0.93 0.93 0.52\nAnimal noises (barking or similar) 0.85 0.93 0.93 0.55\nCrying or screeching of animals 0.83 0.93 0.93 0.57\nScreaming or crying of children/infants 0.94 0.93 0.93 0.62\n1"
