There has been, however, little \nsustained investigation of the uneven modalities of labour exploitation across what are increasingly financialised \nsystems of mental health research. This theoretical paper advances conceptual and empirical investigations of \nlabour in health research – outlining how material precarity and epistemic precarity often go hand in hand, and \nlargely drawing on examples from the UK. The intertwining of labour relations and epistemic cultures can be \nunderstood by bringing together insights from two bodies of knowledge not commonly in contact with one \nanother – survivor/service user research and critical research on universities and academic labour. The article \naddresses how mental health research makes significant use of the labour of (i) contract researchers (many of \nwhom work on precarious and exploitative contracts); (ii) lay contributors (through ‘patient and public \ninvolvement ’); and (iii) research participants (where the conditions underpinning participation in various kinds \nof research increasingly blur the distinction between volunteering, and ‘gig’ work). Labour relations affect, and \nare affected by, efforts to change epistemic cultures and reduce epistemic inequalities, and epistemic and ma-\nterial precarity make efforts to improve research culture much more difficult. Those experiencing both material \nand epistemic precarity in health research systems need to be at the heart of efforts to combat both.   \n1.Introduction \nResearch culture – the ‘behaviours, values, expectations, attitudes \nand norms of our research communities ’ (Royal Society, n.d.) – needs \nimproving. A multitude of research institutions, professional societies, \nfunders (e.g. Wellcome Trust and Shift Learning, 2020 ) and researchers \nagree. The current focus on research culture betokens a broad concern \nwith a range of problems, inequities, and exclusions in how research is \nbeing done, who is doing it, and how it is rewarded. There are ongoing \nefforts to shift scientific incentives in publishing and promotion prac-\ntices, to extend ‘open science ’ and data-sharing, to improve equality and \ndiversity initiatives, to better address research misconduct, bullying and \nharassment, to improve job security, and to be more inclusive of lay and \ncommunity-produced expertise (Metcalfe et al., 2020 ; Tembo et al., \n2021 ). In this paper we consider mental health research specifically in \norder to trace a different pathway through debates commonly conducted \nunder the aegis of research culture. Rather than focusing on the full scope of issues addressed under this umbrella term, we turn to two \nbodies of counter-knowledge that, we argue, provide frameworks for \nunderstanding how epistemic and material precarity make efforts to \nimprove research culture much more difficult. One body – survivor \nresearch, where researchers produce knowledge about mental health \nand mental health services by drawing epistemologically from their own \nexperience of psychiatric services, mental distress and associated \nactivism (e.g. Russo and Sweeney, 2016 ; Sweeney et al., 2009 ) – origi-\nnated out of engagements with mental health research and services. The \nother – critical research on the university that foregrounds labour re-\nlations (e.g. Carpenter et al., 2021 ) – addresses the university in its \nentirety not only as a site of knowledge production but as a workplace. \nBoth bodies of literature identify much that is problematic and \nharmful concerning the production of research. They are joined here by \ndisciplines such as feminist science and technology studies and Black \nstudies which have also opened up new imaginaries to envisage more \njust means of producing knowledge and to rethink scientificity \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: Stan.papoulias@kcl.ac.uk (S.(C.

Survivor research and critical research on the uni-\nversity tend to analyse the landscape of research differently from one \nanother, and offer distinct routes through which to effect change. We \ninvestigate what is at stake in these differing analyses and argue that \ntheir insights be brought more closely together. There is an urgent need \nto better document and address how labour relations affect epistemic \ncultures, and vice versa (Simbürger, 2014 ). The conditions under which \npeople labour in health research, and the subjectivities they enact while \ndoing so, shape the styles of thought governing disciplines (under -\ncommoning, 2016 ); are entangled with the methods and infrastructures \nthat make up research ecologies; produce barriers to certain actors ’ \nparticipation in the production of knowledge (Crook, 2020 ); determine \nwho is able to contribute knowledge deemed to be scientific (Pereira, \n2019 ); and bear on how data are collected and analysed, papers pub-\nlished, and determinations made about authorship (Larivi ˇere et al., \n2016 ). Our interest lies specifically in understanding how conditions of \nprecarity – of vulnerability, insecurity and contingency – operate both \nmaterially and epistemically, with one tending to reinforce the other. \nAddressing the conjoint production of material and epistemic precarity \nmust, we argue, be central to any initiative to improve research culture. \nWe focus largely on mental health research in the UK – where we \nhave both worked and in which we publish, one of us as a user/survivor \nand contract researcher. UK mental health research comprises a complex \ninfrastructural ecology devoted to research on the causes of mental ill \nhealth, the promotion of mental health, and interventions to address \nmental health. In recent years, governments have encouraged mental \nhealth researchers to develop shared, large databases and international \nresearch networks; to include people with mental health problems in the \nconduct of research; and to intensify academic-industrial collaboration \n(Department of Health, 2017 ). There is still much to investigate on how \nrecent transformations in UK mental health research are reshaping sci-\nentific knowledge production (Atkinson et al., 2019 ). While some work \non the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), founded \nin England in 2006, suggests that its funding allocations have contrib -\nuted to the flexibilisation of the research nurse workforce (Caffrey et al., \n2019 ; Shaw and Greenhalgh, 2008 ; Walshe and Davies, 2013 ), there are \nfew systematic explorations of how policy initiatives and major funders \nin UK health research (such as UK Research and Innovation and The \nWellcome Trust) have helped institutionalise particular forms of labour \nrelations in research-active institutions (Faulkner-Gurstein et al., 2019 ). \nWe hope this paper encourages further empirical and conceptual in-\nvestigations of labour in mental health research – and health research \nmore broadly – in the UK and elsewhere. \nMental health research is an exemplary site in which to explore the \nentwinement of material and epistemic precarity. First, while survivor \nresearch is a key site of epistemological and methodological innovation \nin mental health research, survivor researchers are, as we go on to detail, \nrepeatedly subject to both epistemic marginalization and material pre-\ncarity. Second, mental health research (particularly as regards trans -\nlational research that attempts to bridge the gap between so-called \n‘bench and bedside ’) is increasingly reliant on collaborations with in-\ndustry (pharmaceutical, biotechnological, bioinformatic) and with other \nactors (including voluntary organisations and charities), which opens \nfurther routes for the transformation of labour relations in research. \nGiven the diverse and often incommensurable ontologies of mental ill \nhealth and psychopathology held by research psychiatrists, psycholo -\ngists and survivors, amongst others (Moncrieff et al., 2005 ), such col-\nlaborations can also pose profound epistemological challenges. Such \nchallenges are compounded in global mental health, a field predomi -\nnantly institutionalised in the Global North but effecting changes in \nmental health practices in the Global South, with many arguing that it is \na ‘neo-colonial project ’ (Davar, 2014 ). Mental health research, then, \ncontains profound contractual, epistemological, and political heteroge -\nneities, where epistemological authority, as well as epistemic delegiti -\nmization, are entangled in racialised and gendered labour relations. \nIn the next two sections, we explore how, firstly, survivor research and, secondly, critical research on the university have addressed power, \nlabour, and knowledge production. We then consider how these two \nbodies of literature might productively be brought together. \n2.Survivor analyses of mental health research \nMental health survivor research is a distinctly political form of \nservice-user-led (patient-led) research, with a history stretching back \nacross several decades (Campbell, 2005 ; Kalathil and Jones, 2017 ). It is \na form of emancipatory research, rooted in the activism of mental health \nservice users and prioritising experiential knowledge as an instrument of \nresearch. The term survivor itself signals the connection to activism, \ninvoking both mental distress and a potentially traumatising or harmful \nencounter with psychiatric services (for example electro-convulsive \ntherapy or involuntary detention). In the UK, survivor research, while \ninitially stemming from unpaid activist work and small-scale funded \nprojects in the third sector, now also takes place in universities, where a \nsmall number of survivor researchers are integrated within the mental \nhealth research workforce. This partial integration relates to the broader \npolicy emphasis towards patient and public involvement (PPI) in health \nresearch, initiated by the New Labour governments in the UK, and based \non the professed inclusion of service users as well as underserved com-\nmunities in the design and execution of health research. It has been \nargued that PPI may improve the quality relevance and implement -\nability of research, contribute to the democratisation of science and \nbenefit the patients and public involved (Brett et al., 2014 ). Conse -\nquently, many UK funders currently expect evidence of active PPI in \nfunding applications. However, both survivor researchers and others \nhave suggested that the current operationalisation of PPI represents a \ntechnocratic and managerialist intervention with little connection to \nemancipatory or democratising imperatives (Madden and Speed, 2017 ) \nand have argued that PPI as typically practiced allocates at best a pe-\nripheral role to service users and may serve to legitimise rather than \nchallenge existing research agendas (Papoulias and Callard, 2021 ). \nFurthermore, PPI initiatives have little power to redefine the parameters \nof what remains in effect an exclusionary research apparatus (Rose and \nKalathil, 2019 ): while funding applicants need to include detailed plans \nfor involvement, disabled people ’s and user-led organisations continue \nto be marginalised from criteria defining funding calls and in the dis-\ntribution of grant funding (Sweeney, 2016 ). Furthermore, even when \nemployed as salaried researchers, survivor researchers frequently \nexperience poor career progression and difficulties acquiring long-term \ncontractual employment (Callard and Rose, 2012 ). Some survivor re-\nsearchers have argued that only a recognition of survivor-led research as \na distinct discipline would untether survivors from working within the \nconfines of biomedical psychiatry (Faulkner, 2017 ). Such recognition \nwould entail forging or renewing situated solidarities between salaried \nsurvivor researchers and grassroots activists (Russo and von Peter, \n2022 ); setting up proactive recruitment, support and mentoring systems \nand adapting working practices in order to counter academic ableism \n(Jones et al., 2021 ); and establishing funding calls specifically tailored \nto survivor research (Sweeney, 2016 ). \nThat survivor research maintains a keen focus on epistemic (in)jus -\ntice (Fricker, 2011 ; Soklaridis et al., 2020 ) cannot be understood \nwithout acknowledging the dynamic between clinician and patient in \nmental health services and treatments. The psychiatric patient is \nperpetually caught in the crosshairs of coercive or involuntary treat-\nment. While the potential delegitimization of knowledge from experi -\nence is present in any patient role – in that patients are frequently not \nregarded as necessarily capable of accurately understanding or trans -\nlating ‘experience ’ in ways legible to ‘mainstream ’ research epistemol -\nogies (Hutchison et al., 2017 ) – it is baked into the definition of the \npsychiatric patient, in so far as the latter is in part defined through \n‘distortions ’ of experience (such as fluctuating capacity, or phenomena \nthat sit under the umbrella term psychosis). Survivor researchers (Costa \net al., 2012 ) argue that this clinician/patient dynamic is reproduced in S.(C. Papoulias and F. Callard"

This epistemic \nprecarity affects knowledge production in mental health research – for \nexample through the many survivor research bids that end up not being \nfunded, or through the difficulties of ensuring that survivors are \ninvolved in the interpretation and data analysis stages of research (since \ntheir inclusion can generate different ways of explaining phenomena \n(Sweeney et al., 2013 )). \nThe clarity with which survivor analyses have demonstrated the \nunequal dynamic between clinical and survivor researcher comes, we \nargue, at a price: that of deprioritizing attention to the complex labour \nrelations which constitute health services and health research systems \n(for some notable exceptions see MacKinnon et al., 2021 ; Voronka, \n2017 ). Survivor accounts often conjure the terrain of university-based \nresearch as a relatively homogeneous ‘body ’. There are frequent in-\nvocations of the ‘conventional ’, ‘traditional ’ or ‘mainstream ’ research \nroles (e.g. Russo, 2012 ; Sweeney and Morgan, 2009 ) – generic roles \ncounterposed to the survivor researcher by virtue of their pro-\nfessionalisation within a broadly positivist health research paradigm. \nThe university, meanwhile, is frequently described as an ivory tower (e. \ng. Sweeney, 2016 ). Such accounts end up carving a bifurcated land-\nscape: survivor researchers and activists (who work with experiential \nknowledge) are marked off from, and assumed to have less power than, \nmainstream academic researchers. What is often not foregrounded is \nhow broader political-economic processes underpinning health research \nhave produced uneven contours of labour exploitation and appropria -\ntion (Welsh, 2020 ). This means significant heterogeneity in material and \nsymbolic power amongst mental health research workers, which invo-\ncation of the generic ‘conventional researcher ’ masks. In other words, \nmany so-called conventional researchers are also precariously posi-\ntioned, both materially and epistemically. \n2.1. Critical research on the university \nResearchers across many disciplines have addressed academic labour \nrelations, as well as the broader political economy of marketised and \nfinancialised universities (Ahmed, 2007 ; Bates, 2021 ; Boggs and \nMitchell, 2018 ; Brienza, 2016 ; Gill, 2014 ; Ivancheva et al., 2019 ; Kelley, \n1996 ; Meyerhoff, 2019 ; Moten and Harney, 2004 ; O’Keefe and Courtois, \n2019 ; Thorkelson, 2016 ). This body of research has jettisoned the fan-\ntasy of an erstwhile virtuous public institution, now beset from the \noutside by malignant capitalist forces that have eroded academic \nfreedom and scholarly independence. Instead, researchers have ana-\nlysed the university as an heterogeneous assemblage comprising varied \ninstitutional (including corporate) actors and infrastructures (Bacevic, \n2018 ). While the university has often been imagined as the guardian of a \npublic good, functioning at a patrician distance from the social world (a \nlofty independence invoked through the ivory tower (see Shapin, \n2012 )), these literatures demonstrate instead that the university cannot \nbe sheared off from longer histories of racist dispossession, exploitation, \nand capital accumulation (Gonz ˘alez and Meyerhoff, 2021 ). The gradual \nwithdrawal of state funding in many countries since the 1980s, accel -\nerating competition for student markets and the push to develop new \nrevenue streams, reconfigures exploitative, extractive, and appropria -\ntive processes through a cast of new actors (Rhoades and Slaughter, \n1997 ; Welsh, 2020 ). New managerial roles have been developed whose \nexplicit function is to deliver strategic planning to ensure competitive \nadvantage, while research and teaching alike are subject to continuous \ninnovation, with staff retention tied to their ability to identify and orient \nthemselves towards revenue-generating activities. In this context, increasingly precarious contractual conditions and intensification of \nworkplace productivity expectations (Dados, 2020 ) run alongside \nintensifying regimes of audit, performance management, and ranking \n(Strathern, 2000 ). \nIn UK mental health research, increased emphasis on translational \nresearch has built intimate relations between universities, biotech -\nnology, information technology and the pharmaceutical industry. \nFaulkner-Gurstein and Wyatt have demonstrated how the platform \nresearch model found today in the UK’s NHS builds research in-\nfrastructures using the strategies of private firms – with an increased \nfocus on facilitating commercial research (Faulkner-Gurstein and Wyatt, \n2021 ). In the USA, the development of translational neuroscience has \npulled universities, healthcare organisations and hospitals into alliances \nwith emergent biotechnology markets fuelled by the chaos of the \n2007 –8 economic crisis. Indeed, Robinson has argued that translational \nscience and medicine is primarily a financial rather than a scientific \nintervention: it has created a complex ‘set of commercial architectures ’ \nthat are intended to embed ‘academic science with private capital ’ \n(Robinson, 2020 , p. 3). High-level roadmaps for UK mental health \nresearch do not specifically address questions of labour outside broad \ngestures towards building capacity for mental health research and \nincluding a wide range of disciplinary expertise. ‘A Framework for \nMental Health Research ’, for example, calls for a ‘more diverse and \nrepresentative ’ workforce, for the recruitment of wider multidisci -\nplinary research expertise, and for ‘build[ing] the careers of service \nusers as researchers ’ (Department of Health, 2017 ). But there are no \nfurther details on how these changes might be effected. \nAs corporate actors continue to find ways to outsource risk to uni-\nversities, and platformisation and commercialisation intensifies, labour \nrelations continue to be transformed. Mental health research requires \nmultiple kinds of labour – for which it has embedded multiple kinds of \ncontractual and voluntary arrangements. Reliance on highly competi -\ntive, fixed-term external funding and ‘projectification ’ entrenches \nstratification among university workers (Sigl, 2016 ), consolidating a \ndistinction between, on the one hand, often relatively secure staff who \nhave accumulated the reputational capital necessary for competing \neffectively for grant income and, on the other, casualised junior workers \ncharged with both the carrying out of research and its administration \n(Paylor and McKevitt, 2019 ). The unpredictability of external funding \nalso produces potential precarity for senior staff whose contracts are in \neffect open rather than permanent, as they are often required to cover a \nproportion of their salary through grant income (Bourne, 2018 ). This \nreliance brings further fragmentation and intensification of work tasks, \ngenerating byzantine grant application regimes, which necessitate \nconsiderable administrative labour to navigate (Fowler et al., 2015 ). The \nresearch workforce spreads well beyond those on academic or research \ncontracts. Data-intensive scientific projects are increasingly reliant on \nthe (relatively) invisible labour of technicians, administrators and stu-\ndents (e.g. for archiving and cleaning data, building collaborations, \nensuring access to different data across national borders, etc.) (Scroggins \nand Pasquetto, 2020 ). Crucial too – though often invisible – are the se-\ncurity guards, cleaners and others who maintain spaces of research. \nResearch participants may also be seen as sources of research labour, \nranging from those receiving substantial payments for participation in \nclinical trials to those receiving no reimbursement at all. Satellite roles \nsuch as those of clinical research delivery staff working in the interface \nbetween universities and research active NHS Trusts (recruitment ad-\nministrators, research-active healthcare professionals, research and \ndevelopment managers) have considerable implications for labour in \nhealth research, since many of these roles are of short duration or pro-\ngramme specific (Caffrey et al., 2019 ; Faulkner-Gurstein et al., 2019 ). \nFurther cadres of staff manage and facilitate lay involvement and \nengagement in research projects, and navigate ‘impact ’, frequently on \nprecarious contracts (Watermeyer and Lewis, 2018 ). \nWho is paid, and how, matters a great deal in mental health research \nmaterially and epistemically.

Outside of health research, \nWarnock and colleagues have emphasised that ‘at PhD and early-career \nlevel, we are often precarious researchers researching precarious lives ’, \nand have insisted, as social scientists, that ‘failing to pay respondents \nwill result in data that are skewed towards the experiences of the \nresourced ’ (Warnock et al., 2022 , pp. 196, 200). Pfoser and de Jong \ndemonstrate how the structural inequalities in artist –academic collab -\norations in increasingly projectified, neoliberal institutions (where only \ncertain kinds of labour tend to be remunerated) shape the kinds of work \nthat is done and methods that are pursued (Pfoser and de Jong, 2020 ). \nBut if research on the university and academic labour has done much to \nbring uneven contours of exploitation to visibility, we still know rela-\ntively little about how labour relations affect epistemic frameworks and \nknowledge production in mental health research specifically. \n2.2. Reading material and epistemic precarities together \nMental health research hinges, we argue, on the entwined produc -\ntion of material and epistemic precarity. Analyses of knowledge pro-\nduction in mental health research would benefit from forging together \nsurvivor-led analyses of epistemic precarity with political-economic \nanalyses of the labour relations underpinning research. Indeed such an \nanalytics is already emerging in some recent studies from Canada and \nthe UK, which have explored how hiring ‘peer ’ and survivor researchers \nto undertake engaged research within research ecologies characterised \nby casualisation and project-based funding logics may end up com-\npounding inequalities, in some cases by blurring the distinction between \nvolunteering and paid work (Heney and Poleykett, 2021 ; MacKinnon \net al., 2021 ). Such analyses can also help illuminate how the installation \nof particular labour relations can embed both behavioural and epistemic \nnorms. For example, problems of research culture – such as bullying, \npoor research conduct, or the epistemic disparagement of researchers \nfrom marginalised groups – need to be addressed not as straightforward \ninstances of power inequalities between conventional and survivor re-\nsearchers, nor as problems to be solved through improving ‘cultures ’, \nbut through combatting systems producing structural and affective de-\npendencies via contractual and other labour relations that help cement \nhierarchical models of intellectual leadership and patronage (Kalinga, \n2019 ; Mason and Megoran, 2021 ; Peacock, 2016 ). \nTo flesh out how epistemic inequalities come to be intimately \nenmeshed with configurations of labour, we consider below three kinds \nof actors in the research ecology of mental health research: (i) contract \nresearchers; (ii) lay (PPI) contributors; and (iii) research participants. \nWe choose these three categories of actor for two reasons. Firstly, \nbecause, in addition to being core actors involved in much mental health \nresearch today, they also represent the three main locations where \nsurvivors may find themselves: invited to be study participants, to \ncollaborate as lay contributors/expert patients, and hired as contract \nresearchers to undertake data collection and analysis. Indeed, the en-\nterprise of survivor research is concerned with highlighting and undoing \nthe kinds of epistemic injustice that such locations engender. Secondly, \nwhile these three locations demand precarious research labour, they are, \nas we show below, routinely addressed in ways that render this labour \ninvisible and which marginalise questions of remuneration and exploi -\ntation. We want, in contrast, to make visible how these roles can aid the \nextraction of surplus value within increasingly financialised health \nresearch systems.  \n(i) Contract researchers \nIn the UK, a growing proportion of academic staff subsist on fixed- \nterm or so-called atypical and zero hours contracts (University and \nCollege Union, 2019 ). This ‘reserve army ’ of low-wage workers and \nstudent researchers undertake much of the actual doing of research, including major parts of ethics board submissions, data collection and \nanalysis and preparing articles for peer review (Spina et al., 2020 ). \nWorkers on six month fixed-term contracts can be brought in to un-\ndertake a single project task such as compiling a systematic review. This \nmeans that contract researchers (including survivor researchers) may \nhave little connection to the overall project, little agency within the \noverall research trajectory, and little chance of working to transform \ndominant paradigms – while also remaining invisible members of aca-\ndemic departments and research groups (Mason and Megoran, 2021 ). \nBringing a broader analysis of precarity to bear on survivor researchers ’ \nwork on epistemic injustice would yield greater understanding of how \nworking conditions attendant upon casualisation may contribute to the \nconsolidation and exclusion of particular paradigms, methods and re-\nlationships, beyond those characterising survivor research. For example, \nresearchers on short contracts can lack the autonomy to take method -\nological and epistemological risks, and staff turnover can preclude the \nembedding of learning across projects and disrupt the sustainability of \npartnerships with public members and other partners (Heney and \nPoleykett, 2021 ). \nThe exploitative effects of such contracts are compounded when \ncontract staff are encouraged to see themselves as Early Career Re-\nsearchers (ECRs), and to interpret their invisibility and lack of agency as \nboth necessary and temporary: the term ECR refers to a stage in a linear \nprocess of career development, a period of apprenticeship for workers on \nthe pathway to professionalisation and recognition (Johnston and Sid-\naway, 2015 ). However, such recognition is increasingly elusive and \nunobtainable – not only for survivor researchers, but for contract re-\nsearchers more broadly. Instead contract research becomes, for most, a \nlong apprenticeship for a future that is increasingly out of reach. As this \nhorizon lengthens, contract researchers, precarious workers in the \nknowledge economy, are encouraged to develop strategies to make \nthemselves marketable, including developing grant proposals that map \nonto funder requirements and their preferred research questions, \nmethods and rationales, while developing their own brand through so-\ncial media presentation, building networks, impact, and engagement \nactivities (Loveday, 2018 ). Carpenter and colleagues have argued that \nthe promise of professionalisation is no longer about workers securing \nautonomy and reputational capital but rather about shoring up the \nreputation of the institution. This process effectively displaces the risks \nof building new revenue streams (including new grants), and engaging \nnew partners, onto those contracted researchers through the ongoing \nproliferation of performance management techniques (Carpenter et al., \n2021 ). This long apprenticeship masks the gendered, racialised and \nableist dimensions of precarity through the installation of yet additional \nforms of unpaid and exploited labour, which Kuehn and Corrigan have \ntermed ‘hope labour ’: ‘un- or under-compensated work carried out in the \npresent, often for experience or exposure, in the hope that future \nemployment opportunities may follow ’ (2013 , p. 10).  \n(ii) Lay (‘PPI ’) contributors \nThe inclusion of lay (including service user/survivor) contributors in \nhealth research further complicates how labour and epistemic issues \nintersect. As already mentioned, survivor researchers have underlined \nthe de-legitimation of user/patient epistemic contribution vis-ˇa-vis \nclinical or academic expertise, and the tokenistic and exclusionary na-\nture of much PPI (Russo and Beresford, 2015 ). However, for the most \npart, arguments around PPI engage an understanding of ‘value ’ related \nto recognition and legitimation of patient knowledge, but divorced from \nthe materiality of labour relations and surplus value extraction. \nTypically, PPI in research in the UK does not constitute employment, \nas there is no contract, no line management and no obligation on the \npart of lay contributors to deliver on a set of predefined duties. Indeed, \nthe continuing salience of models that profile patient altruism (Adams \nand McKevitt, 2015 ) and volunteering (Grotz et al., 2021 ) make it \ndifficult to represent value in terms other than those of recognition.

This is particularly notable in the cur-\nrent emphasis on co-production in health research, which demands long \nterm collaborative relationships between different stakeholders, \nincluding patient groups and salaried researchers, requiring a sustain -\nable and ongoing commitment to the ‘doing’ of a research project. \nIndeed, in the UK, when and how to pay lay contributors is a fraught \nissue: current NIHR guidelines (National Institute for Health Research, \n2021) leave open the question of whether PPI roles constitute employ -\nment, stating that depending on context, service user or public con-\ntributors might be classified as employees, self-employed, casual \nworkers, or volunteers – noting that such classification has considerable \nimplications for lay contributors’ taxation, their workers’ rights, and \ntheir ability to access welfare benefits. We see here a fraught terrain \nwhere control over the use, value, and compensation of people’s labour \nraises complex questions over how health research systems draw actors \ninto different kinds of (potentially exploitative) relations, and where \nthere are still many unanswered questions concerning the appropriate \ndistribution of epistemic and material value across actors and research \ninstitutions.  \n(iii) Research participants \nTo consider research participants as potentially part of a research \nworkforce may appear counter-intuitive. After all, bioethics, as the \ndiscipline that has most visibly shaped the models for research partici -\npation, has sought to protect research participants from exploitation, \nand has accustomed us to ensuring that no undue incentivisation takes \nplace which might induce people to participate in research (Resnik, \n2015). Participants, on such a model, should be compensated for their \ntime and potential discomfort rather than paid for their labour. How-\never, as Cooper and Waldby have argued, while bioethics has sought to \nkeep research subjects safe from market forces, by ‘enshrining the \nprinciples of donation, voluntarism, informed consent, and freedom \nfrom coercion’ (Cooper and Waldby, 2014, p. 8), the growth of extensive \nnew labour markets around research, as well as the increasing reliance \nof researchers on novel forms of research participation, has made such \nringfencing much more difficult to sustain. Current conditions of \ncompetitive research funding, the demand for large and complex trials, \nand the strong incentivisation towards collaboration with industry, force \na recalibration of what research participation might mean. In this \ncontext, Monahan and Fisher have investigated what they identify as \n‘sacrificial labour’ of ‘healthy volunteers’ for pharmaceutical Phase 1 \nclinical trials in the US (Monahan and Fisher, 2020). They argue that \nresearch participants in these trials are effectively workers, bound by \nshort-term contracts, which embed exploitative work practices and \nexacerbate racialised dispossession (Fisher et al., 2020). Monahan and \nFisher conceptualise sacrificial labour as employer-oriented self--\nsacrifice (of one’s health, social relations, etc.), which ends up using the \nworker up in the service of health research, while also compromising \ntheir very sense of self and stalling their future aspirations. Relatedly, \nrecent studies have considered how the increasing use of crowdsourcing \nmarketplaces for data collection, for example Amazon’s Mechanical \nTurk platform (MTurk), effectively challenges the distinction between \nresearch participation and (under)paid labour. Thousands of scientific \nstudies make use of MTurkers to harvest research participants: while it is \ndifficult to discern how many of these would fall under the umbrella of \n‘mental health research’, it is increasingly the case that psychology \nresearch has seized upon the internet and commercial platforms in \nparticular for easy access to larger samples and a more diverse pool of \nparticipants. MTurkers are registered users whom researchers may \ncontract individually to complete specific tasks (for example question -\nnaires or experimental stimuli) at very low rates of pay. In 2016, Pittman \nand Sheehan calculated that approximately half a million registered \nMTurkers were paid as little as 5 cents per task and incentivised to take \non work via algorithmic rating of their performance and readiness to take on tasks – so that researchers’ rejection of individual MTurkers’ \nwork resulted in low ratings which can negatively impact their earning \ncapacity (Pittman and Sheehan, 2016). MTurkers increasingly report \nthat they rely on the platform for income, a development which ques-\ntions the extent to which their right to withdraw from a study may be \nexercised. Furthermore, the low rates of pay and the absence of pro-\ntective legislation render this form of research participation more akin to \nsweatshop labour (Gleibs, 2017). \nThe contracted clinical research participant and the MTurker blur \nthe line between research volunteering and the zero-hours unprotected \nworker. Such blurring adds a particular dimension to current drives to \nmaximise participation in health research and to extend such partici -\npation to those construed as ‘hard to reach’ or ‘underserved’ social \ngroups. These drives are routinely framed as benevolent: widening \nresearch participation contributes to combatting health inequalities and \ndeveloping inclusive treatments (National Institute for Health Research, \n2020). However, if we reframe some health research participation as \nunderpaid, unpaid, or indeed sacrificial labour in increasingly finan -\ncialised health research systems, then we need also to ask who is \nbenefitting from such labour, and at what cost to those who undertake it. \nMuch remains unclear – for example the extent to which insecure \nworking conditions and speculative strategies (see Fisher et al., 2020) \nare produced through the demands that health research makes on the \nbodies and minds of research participants; the extent to which research \nparticipation, under conditions of austerity, becomes a crucial source of \nincome, and for whom; or whether mental health service users, who are \nfrequently disproportionately dispossessed through discriminatory \nstructural logics including racism, are particularly disadvantaged in \nrelation to the changing labour relations governing research \nparticipation. \n2.3. On not feeding the beast \nWe wish to end by looking at two articles that contribute to \ncombatting epistemic precarity by proposing ways to integrate survivor \nresearchers into the research workforce. We do so to make clear some of \nthe challenges of addressing epistemic and material precarity together. \nEach article puts forward different solutions, and each relies on a \ndifferent form of professionalisation. In ‘Management of a High- \nPerforming Mental Health Recovery Research Group’, Mike Slade out-\nlines a leadership model which embraces the commodification of aca-\ndemic productivity and trains survivor researchers to ‘“[feed] the beast” \nby meeting key performance indicators’ (Slade, 2021, p. 1). Slade’s \napproach consists in tightly managing a highly efficient production line \nto maximise publications and other ‘deliverables’ so that each \npost-graduate researcher employed for five-years on a grant ‘can expect \nto emerge with 25 new grant-related papers in their CV’. This produc -\ntion line logic is enabled and sustained through what the author de-\nscribes as a tight support structure: regular and highly structured \nsupervisions as well as group activities which consolidate a shared group \nidentity. Noting that all researchers in his group have fixed-term con-\ntracts funded through grants, Slade recognises that many face financial \ninsecurity, housing pressures and ‘ongoing mental health difficulties’. In \nthis recognition however, the effects of material precarity become \nvisible only as individual anxieties that may be kept at bay by balancing \nappropriate accommodations without compromising high job expecta -\ntions. Researchers are to understand that their continuing employment \nrelies on their ability to deliver: ‘we are a professional research group \nand not a charity’ (Slade, 2021, p. 4). Here professionalisation is pre-\nsented as a balm only to a select few capable of shearing off the effects of \nmaterial precarity by becoming more competitive in a brutal labour \nmarket. \nBy contrast, in ‘Lived Experience, Research Leadership, and the \nTransformation of Mental Health Services: Building a Researcher Pipe-\nline’, Nev Jones and colleagues argue that the integration of user/sur -\nvivor researchers would require a capacious transformation of, rather S.(C.

They advocate for proactive \nrecruitment of those with psychiatric disabilities and recognise the need \nfor a ‘flexible approach to work and academic accommodations’, along \nthe lines of mentoring and training afforded to other under-represented \ngroups in the academy. Furthermore, they argue for a challenging of \nableism (‘the assumption that psychiatric disability, particularly when \ninvolving psychosis or cognitive challenges … is the antithesis of aca-\ndemic excellence’ (Jones et al., 2021, p. 2)), and a recognition that a \nsurvivor workforce challenges the normative equation of professional -\nism with scientific neutrality (Jones et al., 2021). \nThe political commitments and social imaginaries of these two arti-\ncles are very different: indeed, Jones and colleagues’ article unpacks and \ncritiques the ableism that underpins rationalised production lines upon \nwhich Slade’s model appears to rely. While Slade imagines that sus-\ntained and disciplined adherence to the demands of the marketised \nuniversity is the pathway for survival, Jones and colleagues conjure an \nalternative professionalisation of inclusion which can enable and sup-\nport survivor researchers to survive within a hostile system. Notably this \nsecond article relates to the U.S. mental health research ecosystem, in \nwhich some tenure-track positions still exist; even so, it is hard to ima-\ngine how such a pipeline and the radical inclusion practices which \nwould underpin it might subsist in the current research landscape. \nProviding resources and accommodations for marginalised groups can \nonly have a limited effect in research environments which, in striving for \never higher standards of competitiveness, aim to potentially intensify \nthe extraction of value from future researchers. Epistemic precarities, we \nargue, cannot be meaningfully addressed without also challenging the \nbroader processes of precaritisation research ecosystems rely on. \nThe desire to open up pathways to professionalisation for margin -\nalised figures cannot escape certain contradictions: professionalisation \nas a process, even when aiming to be more inclusive, necessarily runs \ninto the difficulty of distinguishing between forms of labour as worthy or \nnot worthy of the ‘protections’ of the professional (Carpenter et al., \n2021). While histories of professionalisation have made clear how \nbottom-up pushes towards professionalisation have allowed precarious \nworkers to gain rights and better conditions (Vaidyanathan, 2012), we \nwant to raise caution concerning the extent to which professionalisation, \nor indeed a push for recognition and inclusivity in mental health \nresearch, can adequately address the problems of both material and \nepistemic precarity that we have raised here. \nBy proposing that we cease ‘feeding the beast’, we hope to bring \ngreater attention to the frames and discourses that commonly surround \ndiscussions of research culture – those of productivity, reputation, \nexcellence, and economic value. In making their assumptions, and their \nlimitations, more visible, we hope to encourage the use and generation \nof other vocabularies and other imaginaries through which to envisage \nthe creation of sustainable research communities that combat material \nand epistemic precarity together. What kinds of social relations and \ninfrastructures can we build and nourish, and what kinds of labour re-\nlations ought we collectively demand and fight for, so as to support not \nonly survivor researchers, but also other epistemically and materially \nprecarious actors, in the ecology of mental health research? \n3.Conclusion \nCurrent initiatives to improve research cultures in health research \nwill founder if they do not address the profoundly uneven labour re-\nlations and dependencies that underpin health research systems and \nfurther consolidate the joint production of material and epistemic pre-\ncarity. While some initiatives around research culture do acknowledge \nthe need to improve job security if one is to improve research integrity \n(Metcalfe et al., 2020), it remains uncommon for labour relations to be \nthe site of sustained and explicit analysis – let alone a focus for urgent \namelioration – in accounts of scientific knowledge production (though see Callard, 2022). While survivor analyses of health research as a site of \nepistemic injustice have consistently opened the terrain of power re-\nlations to further scrutiny, survivor research, in its concentration on \nepistemic precarity, may unwittingly flatten out the heterogeneity of \nmaterial precarities and exploitative labour relations which inflect and \nshape epistemic cultures and the doing of health research. Through \nindicating how labour relations are intertwined with epistemic in-\nequalities, and calling for additional, empirical and conceptual research \nthat would help us understand their relation, we want to open other \npaths towards both understanding uneven terrains of knowledge pro-\nduction and envisaging means of effecting change. Survivor research is \nonly one of a number of interdisciplinary research sites that address \nepistemic precarity and it is our hope that our analysis here can be \ncomplemented by other efforts to document how epistemic and material \nprecarity coalesce in health research. \nIf universities are sites of capital accumulation, we need to deepen \nour understanding of how particular organisational actors (including \nfunders, para-sectoral bodies, and implementers of government policies) \nhave experimented with new kinds of labour relations in health research \n(see Mitchell, 2015). Addressing material and epistemic precarities \ntogether is, we argue, a powerful way to promote such understanding. \nFor example, it allows us to explore how the blurring between research \nparticipant and gig economy worker alters the social relations under -\npinning research and affects the data elicited through it. It also enables \nus to consider how imperatives to maximise patient recruitment and \nincrease ‘inclusivity’ in research might have unanticipated effects on the \nbodies and minds of those targeted by them. In this paper we have \nfocused on mental health research, and on the figure of the survivor in \nparticular, insofar as this figure can shuttle between various roles in an \never-expanding workforce: contract researcher, lay contributor, study \nparticipant. If patients and service users are now being positioned as \nworkers within a broader mental health research landscape, then we can \nmake use of this positioning as a vantage point from which to analyse \nhow such new forms of precarity and labour exploitation underpin the \nbroader business models structuring mental health research. \nBringing survivor research insights and critical analyses of university \nlabour together should point to other ways of developing sites and \nmodes of relation through which the survivor researcher, amongst \nothers, might generate knowledge. For, as Voronka has described it, we \nneed to find ways of disturbing and rerouting processes that otherwise \nend up commodifying survivors’ experiences of madness within systems \nthat, through their very commitment to smooth, psychiatric recovery, \n‘sustain our subjugation’ (Voronka, 2017, p. 337). As incoming gener -\nations of researchers and other workers involved in mental health \nresearch struggle against insecure and exploitative working conditions, \nthey will face the challenge of attempting to build ‘security through \nreciprocity and solidarity’ (Facer, 2020, p. 39). We want to push for \nforms of relation that subsist outside or beyond the contractual, and \nfrequently exploitative, relations so common in health research today. If \nprofessionalisation is underpinned by geographies of exclusion, where \n‘unprofessional’ others are shed, then we need to work towards other \nhorizons. Learning from the epistemic and material vantage point of the \nsurvivor researcher in mental health research is one place to start in \ncreating new solidarities in precarity. \nCredit author statement \nStan Papoulias: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, \nWriting – Original Draft, Writing – Review and Editing, Project admin -\nistration, Funding acquisition Felicity Callard: Conceptualization, \nMethodology, Investigation, Writing – Original Draft, Writing – Review \nand Editing, Project administration, Funding acquisition. \nDeclaration of competing interest \nNone.
