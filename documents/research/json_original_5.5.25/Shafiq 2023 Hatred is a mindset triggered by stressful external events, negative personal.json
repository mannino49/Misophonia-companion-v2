This article aims to explore what information can \nbe obtained from the medical literature to understand the reasons regarding the generation of hatred in human beings. \nMethods: Systematic search of medical literature was carried out on the PubMed medical library to identify articles that \ndeal with the subject matter of hatred. Articles included were those added to the PubMed library in 2015 and onwards till \nthe date of data collection. Included articles were divided into ten categories according to the aspect of hatred discussed. \nFull text search of those articles was carried out that were identified under the category of ‘generation of hatred’ was car -\nried out. Data was collected to understand the generation of hatred by carrying out a thematic analysis. \nResults: The word hatred is used in a variety of meanings in medical literature. Medical researchers utilise a variety of \nmethods and take several different kinds of approaches to understand various aspects of development of hatred. \nHatred is a mindset that people can develop for several reasons. Hatred can take a focus towards one’s own self, towards \ninanimate objects or towards other people. Stressful events, personal interpretations, group interpretations and real or \nvirtual life environmental factors are some of the major reasons that may contribute towards the generation of hatred.\nConclusion: Findings from this literature search suggest that there is no single pattern or theory that can fully explain \nthe development of hatred in humans: hateful mindsets can manifest in numerous ways. Each manifestation can be \nunderstood in its unique context and background. There seem to be some common external and internal factors that \nare recurrently identified across the studies that tend to play a role towards its generation.  Some of the internal reasons \nthat may lead to development of hatred include personal attitudes, negative cognitions, negative feelings, and individual \nmotivations of the hater etc. Some of the external reasons may include suffering sexual abuse, negative life experiences \nand exposure to online hateful activities on social media etc. \nKeywords\nHate, Hatred, Hating, Hateful, Hatred Development, Hatred Generation, Hatred Mindset, Hatred In Humans, Terrorist Attacks\n © Shafiq 2023.

Freud refers to the pivotal role of human \nemotions as an integral part of a growing baby’s \nexperience in some of the most fundamental \nconcepts that he described. Oedipal Complex and \nAmbivalence both include interplays of emotions \n(Freud, 1924). Darwin studied emotions across \nvarious cultures of the world, not only in humans \nbut in animals too. His book on this subject is \ntitled `The expression of the emotions in man and animals´ (Darwin, 1872). Eckman who is a \npsychologist and anthropologist developed an atlas \nof human emotions. He identified 10,000 facial \nexpressions that can express up to 3,000 different \nkinds of emotions (Ekman, 2018). He states that \nwords are representations of emotions, but not the \nemotions themselves. According to him, `Emotion \nis a process, a particular kind of automatic appraisal \ninfluenced by our evolutionary and personal past, \nin which we sense that something important to \nour welfare is occurring, and a set of physiological \nchanges and emotional behaviours begin to deal \nwith the situation´ (Ekman, 2004). Eckman \nidentified six basic emotions including fear, anger, \njoy, sadness, disgust, and surprise. Hatred is not"

The word is well-known to speakers of \nthe English language. It is commonly used in day-\nto-day interactions and in a variety of informal \nmeanings. For example, hatred may be used \ninterchangeably to express negative emotions such \nas disgust or resentment or dislike or disrespect \netc. Expressions like love-hate are well known both \nin verbal and written communications. Few hate-\nrelated terms have started receiving importance \nfollowing some significant events around the globe. \nFor example, hate-crime, hate-group, group-hate, \nhatemonger, hate-speech, hate-mail, hate-rally, \nracial-hate, hate-campaign, or collective-hate etc. \nHatred is used as noun. Hate is used as both verb \nand noun. Hateful is adjective. Hating is verb. \nHatred in Philosophy\nBrogaard (2020) describes in her book, titled \n`Hatred, Understanding Our Most Dangerous \nEmotion´ that all emotions have some characteristic \nattached to them sometimes also called their \nvalence.  Hatred is one with a negative valence. \nShe describes some other important concepts to \nelaborate on hatred. `Intentionality´ is the outward \ndirectedness of our mental state. `Intentionality´ \nseparates emotions from moods, the latter are not \nabout any particular thing or event. For example, \ndepression may be experienced by those suffering \nfrom mood disorders without any reason. Emotions \nhave a focus of concern (or simply called `focus´), \ni.e., something that has triggered the emotion. For \nexample, it can be triggered in response to an action \nor verbal expression. Emotions may also have a \ntarget though this may not always be the case. \nHowever, hatred has both. `Emotional blaming´ \ninvolves accusing others, holding them responsible \nfor their actions or foreseeable consequences of \ntheir actions. However, in the case of hatred, blame \nis above and beyond the observer’s perception \nof someone’s guilt. How an observer’s mind \nperceives something then leads to a relationship \nimpairing attitude in them.  In the case of hatred, \nthe generation of relationship impairment is also \naccompanied with a kind of inner protest. The \nblame, thus, may manifest as ‘disrespect’ for the one who is hated because they performed the act that is \ndisapproved. \nBrogaard identifies three further types of disrespect \nincluding critical disrespect, dehumanising \ndisrespect, and hubris. When blame involves \ndehumanising disrespect, it tends to focus on \nwho one is, rather than what one has done. She \ncalls this human tendency of dehumanising blame \nfor their flawed character as condemnation.  To \ncondemn someone for their flawed character is to \ndisrespect them for cultivating or failing to unlearn \nthe corresponding bad habits. Contempt creates an \nirreparable power imbalance and hate is also tied \nto fear or reprehension. Hate is a complex emotion, \nbuilt out of negative emotions: resentment, \ncondemnation, and reprehension. Disrespect is the \ncomponent that unites antagonistic emotions such \nas anger, resentment, indignation, envy, blame, \ncontempt and hate. \nHatred in Neurology\nThere are several attempts done to understand the \nneurological aspects of hatred. For example, Zeki \nand Romaya carried out functional MRI studies to \nexamine the neurological reactions inside the brains \nof the participants when they viewed the images \nof the people who they hated (Zeki and Romaya, \n2008). The authors reported  that certain parts of \nthe brain including the amygdala and the premotor \ncortex showed increased activity when people \nwatched these images. The authors concluded that, \nthere is a unique pattern of activity in the brain \nin the context of hate, distinct from the pattern of \nactivity that correlates with romantic love. \nHatred in Neurodevelopment\nFrom the neurodevelopmental perspective when \nwe encounter a stimulus then the hippocampal \nsystem usually is the first responder that may draw \ninformation from neocortical system to help us \nunderstand the meaning of the stimulus. If the \nstimulus is repeated, then it may become part \nof general knowledge based neocortical system \npermanently (Bodenhausen et al., 2003). This \nsystem enables us to navigate through reality quickly \nwithout paying much attention to each stimulus \nrepeatedly. He describes that these schemas help us \nmake sense of unspecified and unknown aspects of \nstimuli or situations.  Although this system offers \nsome flexibility, it is not perfect and is prone to errors"

For example, how a \nperson appreciates stereotypes can be considered as \nan error in interpretation of social information in \nthese schemas. The stereotypes get embedded into \nthe neocortical system and are highly resistant to \nchange. Once the stereotypes get incorporated into \na person’s world view then several cognitive errors \ncan make it persistent. Errors in judgment can \nsometimes happen just by automatic activation of \nschemas.  \nHatred in Sociology\nCulture is sometimes called `the personality of a \nsociety´. Society teaches its norms to individuals \nliving within them and these differ across cultures. \nSocial identity theory emanates from social \ncognition tradition (Tversky and Kahneman, \n1973). Social cognition approaches rely on the \nobservations that the human mind is not a perfect \ninformation processing unit. The human mind has \nan innate tendency to utilize shortcuts to categorize \ninformation quickly and efficiently from our social \nworlds and draw conclusions from what we perceive. \nThese shortcuts, or mental heuristics, allow for \nfaster processing of information, but they also make \nus susceptible to a wide array of poor judgments. \nSome authorities believe that social categorisation \nof individuals, such as gender and ethnicity, would \nnot gain importance unless they are internalised \n(Tajfel et al., 1979). An individual may internalise \na variety of social identities that may manifest in \ndifferent kind of encounters that a person comes \nacross in life.  Availability heuristic as described by \nTversky and Kahneman also influences people´s \ntendancy to overestimate certain classes of events. \nWhen memory of certain events is available readily,  \nits prevalence is overestimated (Tversky and \nKahneman, 1973). Some of the social influences \nthat may contribute to development of hatred \ninclude prejudice (Taylor and Moghaddam 1994), \nintergroup aggression (Sherif, 1937), construction \nof social norms (Sherif, 1937), the power of social \nroles (Zimbardo et al, 1974), bystander apathy \n(Latan and Darley, 1968), obedience to authority \n(Milgram, 1965) and conformity (Asch, 1951). `In-\ngroup´ is a term used to describe a social group to \nwhich a person  psychologically identifies with. \nOn the contrary, `out-group´  is a social group \nwith which an individual does not identify with. \nAccording to Harrington, the social scientists \nconsider intergroup hostility, aggressive behaviour, \nprejudice, and ethnocentrism as the major factors that lead to the development of hatred in a group \n(Harrington, 2004).\nHatred in Psychology\nStaub (2005) defines hatred as a strong negative \nfeeling against the object that is hated. The hater sees \nthe object of their hatred as bad, immoral, dangerous, \nor all this together. According to him, a triangle of \nthree components leads to development of hatred. \nThey include negation of intimacy (distancing from \nobject of hatred), presence of passions (for example \nintense anger) and the cognitions of diminution \nand devaluation through contempt for targeted \ngroup. The hater considers contempt towards target \ngroup and considers them barely human or even \nmay consider them inhuman. Hatred then leads \nto acts of intense violence, for example, terrorism, \nmassacres, and genocides (Sternberg, 2005).  Based \non this model Sternberg outlined seven types \nof hatred that consist of components of these \nthree factors in various combinations. `Accepted \nhatred´ is one in which intimacy is denied but \nno harm is done. `Hot hatred´ is dominated by \nintense feeling of hatred that may result in escape \nor attack. `Cold hatred´ is dominated by feelings \nof devaluation. `Burning hatred´ is one in which \na group is inferiorised and it is felt that something \nneeds to be done about this group. In `simmering \nhatred´ an individual is disliked forever, intimacy \nis denied, and commitment is devalued. In `furious \nhatred´ passion and devaluation of commitment is \nobserved. And `all-embracing hatred’ is dominated \nby denial of intimacy, devaluation of commitment \nand passion often resulting in a need to annihilate \nthe one that is hated.\nNavarro et al (2013) reported that the victim of \nhatred is devaluated intentionally with increasing \nintensity to a degree that they loses all human or \nmoral considerations in the eyes of the hater.  As \nthe feeling of hatred is intensified the hater can take \nsteps to harm or even eliminate the object that is \nhated. To support the ideology of hatred, relevant \nsituations are created, and even facts are distorted \nto spread and promote hatred.\nIn the cognitive behavioural model, it is \nunderstood that thoughts influence feelings and \nemotions that in turn influence behaviours (Beck, \n1991). The following cognitions are reported to \ncontribute to the generation of hatred including: \novergeneralisation i.e., generalising a small event"

They are expected to \nidentify protective factors that can help understand \nand stop development of hatred. Hatred can \nmanifest in the form of signs and symptoms of \ncertain psychiatric conditions too, like depression, \npsychosis, phobias, or PTSD. Reverse causality \nalso plays a role between hatred and mental health \nproblems: is it hatred that leads to mental health \nproblems or vise versa? Consider the example \nof hatred exhibited by those who are involved in \nterrorist activities. Mental health professionals are \nkeen to understand whether terrorists are mentally \nunwell, thus, get involved in such activities, or \nthey get involved in such activities and as a result \nbecome unwell. \nThis study seeks to find answers to these questions \nby systematically reviewing the medical literature. \nOne purpose of this study is to test the observation whether the word hatred is used with a variety of \nmeanings in medical literature or not. Another is \nto combine the knowledge that is acquired from the \ndata regarding the generation of hatred.\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES\nTo carry out systematic literature search on an \ninternational medical database to find what the \nemerging categories in which the word hatred is used \nin medical literature are, and to gather information \nregarding the generation of the emotion of hatred \nin human beings by thematically analysing the \nrelevant collected data. \nMETHODS\nTo identify the information on hatred relevant \nfor mental health professionals, we performed a \nsystematic review using the following approach \nand criteria. We used the following strategies for \nliterature identification and selection. \nLiterature search strategy\nResearch was carried out on PubMed database on \nNational Library of Medicine (NCIB), to identify \nthe studies containing words ‘hate’ , ‘hatred’ , ‘hateful’ \nor ‘hating’ within the title or abstract of the articles. \nWe used the following search terms: hate [Title/\nAbstract]) OR (hatred [Title/Abstract])) OR (hateful \n[Title/Abstract]) OR (hating [Title/Abstract]. \nEligibility criteria\nAll relevant medical studies that were available on \nPub Med medical database on 14th Nov 2021. \nInclusion criteria\nThe included articles contained either of the words \nhate/hatred/hating/hateful in either title or abstract. \nExclusion criteria \nThere were no exclusion criteria.\nPaper selection strategy\nA total of 1193 studies were identified on 14th Nov \n2021 utilising the above search terms.

This led to the \nselection of 500 of the most recent studies on \nPubMed as appearing on NCIB (National Center \nfor Biotechnology Information) library. \nData extraction\nTitles and abstracts of the identified five hundred \nstudies were reviewed by the author and imported \nto NVivo (qualitative data analysis software) \nversion-10 for data interpretation and an endnote \ndiary of references was kept. After removing \nduplicates, 470 studies were included in the review. \nThey were categorized, and selected papers were \nsubmitted to thematic analyses. \nData items and synthesis of results\nFollowing the title and abstract review, each study \nout of the 470 was categorised according the 10 \ncontent themes to understand different aspects of \nthe use of word `hatred´ in medical literature. Data \nwas then extracted from 113 studies that qualified \nfor the emerging category of ‘generation of hatred’ \nafter full text review.  With the intention to carry \nout a thematic analysis aimed at understanding \nthe generation of hatred, each of the 113 studies \nwas given a code with the aim to understand the \ngeneration of hatred. The common codes were \ncombined under one theme. The details of emerging \nthemes are discussed within the results sections of \nthis paper.  \nThematic analysis\nThematic analysis is a method of interpreting \nqualitative data. According to Braun and Clarke \n(2006) thematic analysis is a method for identifying, \nanalysing, and reporting patterns (themes) within \ndata. It minimally organizes and describes the data \nset in rich detail. Sometimes it may go deeper and \nattempt to interpret multiple aspects of the topic \nbeing researched (Boyatzis et al, 1998). According \nto Braun and Clarke, a theme captures something \nimportant about the data in relation to the research \nquestion and represents some level of patterned \nresponse or meaning within a data set. Overall, the \nthematic analysis aims to find the repeated pattern \nof themes that can be clustered together, and the \nfinal product must contain an account of what was done and why.\nRESULTS \nOutcome of Literature search and eligibility \nassessment\nTo organise the papers we followed the Prisma flow \ndiagram. The diagram shows our selection process.\nTo find that in which context the words hate/\nhatred/hateful/hating were used and what medical \nresearchers were aiming to explore, the following \nten categories emerged (table 1). \nIn all ten identified categories, a record was kept of \nthe titles of the studies with relevant references and \nof the context in which the word/s were used within \nthe title or abstract. \nThe table provides the results of the eligibility \nassessment for the subject generation of hatred. Only \nthose 113 studies that focused on the generation of \nhatred were used for further analysis and discussion. \nThe sum total of studies in this table is 488. This is \ndue to some studies being included under more than \none category.   \nThe following paragraph indicates the categories \nin papers used and not used in further thematic \nanalysis. According to the eligibility assessment, the \nfollowing categories were not included in the main \nanalyses of the generation of hatred. The categories \nare explained to reveal their differences from the \nmain subject of the study i.e. generation of hatred. \nLiteral meaning of the word\n 79 studies were identified as using the word hate or \nhatred in literal meaning. For example, as used in the \ntitle of the study, “Salmonella and Reactive Oxygen \nSpecies~ A Love-Hate Relationship” (Rhen, 2019).\nIn context of medical or psychiatric conditions\n20 studies were identified as using the word hate \nor hatred as a symptom of a medical or psychiatric \ncondition. For example, as used in the title of the \nstudy, “Confinement and the Hatred of Sound in \nTimes of COVID-19: A Molotov Cocktail for People \nwith Misophonia” (Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-\nLlort, 2021)."

      "text": "57\nGLOBAL PSYCHIATRY ARCHIVES  — Generation and manifestation of hatredUnique meanings\n 7 studies were identified as using the words hate/\nhatred in some unique sense that couldn’t be coded \nelsewhere. For example, in the abstract of the \nstudy, `Image-based Analysis of Emotional Facial \nExpressions in Full Face Transplants´, the authors \ndescribed that they studied 6 emotional expressions \nin patient who underwent face transplant and one \nof them included hate (Bedeloglu et al., 2018).\nWord is used but not relevant to current \ninvestigation\n6 studies were identified in which the words hate/\nhatred was used in a context considered to be \nirrelevant to the overall aim of the study. For \nexample, the study titled, `Is there an association \nbetween surgeon hat type and 30-day wound \nevents following ventral hernia repair?´ (Haskins \net al., 2017). The abstract contained the statement: \nOur findings suggest that surgical hate  type may \nbe chosen at the discretion of operating room \npersonnel without fear of detriment to their \npatients. The word hate is a typo/misspelling here. \nUsed in keywords but not in title or abstract\n 25 studies were identified that contained one of the \nfour words within the ‘keywords’ section but not in \ntitle or abstract of the study. They were not included \nin the overall interpretation. \nTopic of a piece of writing\nTwo studies were identified in which authors \ndiscussed hate/hatred as commenting/discussing \non someone else’s writings. For example, the title of \none of the studies was, For ‘Physicians of the Soule’: \nThe Roles of ‘Flight’ and ‘Hatred of Abomination’ \nin Thomas Wright’s The Passions of the Minde in \nGenerall” . (Firth-Godbehere, 2015). \nDetection/assessment of hatred\n 130 studies were identified that discussed assessment \nand detection of hatred by various means. For \nexample, in one study authors integrate social \nneuroscience findings with classic social psychology \ntheories offering a framework to better understand \nhow intergroup threat can lead to violence. The \nrole of moral disengagement, dehumanization, \nand intergroup schadenfreude in this process are \ndiscussed, together with their underlying neural mechanisms (Lantos and Molenberghs, 2021). \nAddressing hatred\n 54 studies were identified that discussed the subject \nof addressing hatred. For example, in one study \nthe author argued that within the Filipino psyche, \nthe notion of ‘Kapwa’ or “shared self ” can be an \nequivalent socio-normative ideal that can be utilized \ntowards not just countering the ill-effects of social \ndiscrimination but also fostering deep communal \nand group solidarity among people, regardless of \nrace, colour and ethnicity (Macaraan, 2021). \nManifestation of hatred\n 52 studies qualified for the category of ‘manifestation \nof hatred’ . For example, Nagy et al (2021) reported \nthat individuals who self-injure often report doing so \nin order to punish the self or express self-hatred and \nself-criticism is associated with NSSI (Non suicidal \nself-injury). Choi (2021) reported that hatred can \nmanifest as hate crime including anti-Asian/anti-\nChinese sentiments and increased discrimination \ndue to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Choi’s paper is  \ntitled `People look at me like I AM the virus”: Fear, \nstigma, and discrimination during the COVID-19 \npandemic´. Mendes and Silva, (2020) reported that \nhatred may manifest as homicide of lesbians, gays, \nbisexuals, transvestites, transexuals, and transgender \npeople.\nFurther discussion below contains the details of the \nfindings and of the emerging themes from thematic \nanalysis that was carried out to understand the \nreasons for generation/development of hatred, the \nprimary aim of this systematic review. \nGeneration of hatred\n 113 studies were identified that focused on \nexploring the generation of hatred. On reading the \ntitle and abstract it was noted that the authors in \nthese studies primarily focused on understanding \nthe reasons that lead to development of the hatred \nare. Whether the reasons are internal, to the hater, \nor external, that one is exposed to. What focus the \nhateful mind-set may take i.e. whether the focus is \ntowards oneself, towards an object, towards an event \nor towards another person or group. To understand \nthe pertinent information, full text reading of each \narticle was carried out and the required information \nwas collected in the form of a table that is available at \nthe end of this article (table 2)."

The studies also throw light \non the reasons that may lead to development of \nhatred. These reasons can be internal i.e., how a hater \ninterprets the information/stimuli that may lead to \nthe generation of hatred, or, external i.e., how factors \ninfluencing/interacting with the hater may lead \nto hatred. Below we present the themes under the \nrespective headings. \nTargets of Hatred \nHatred can be directed inwards (self-hatred). It can \nbe directed outwards for example directed towards \nother humans or towards inanimate objects. \nSele-hatred\nWe found that people can develop hatred towards \ntheir own selves due to the following reasons. \nThe themes reported by medical researchers are \nmentioned in alphabetical order below.\nAttraction towards minors\nIt can develop due to being attracted towards children \n[‘non-offending paedophiles’ or ‘minor attracted \npersons’] (Stevens et al., 2019).\nDrugs use and sex working\nIt can develop due to being in the hypothetical \nscenario of being infected with HIV/AIDS in future \nby sex workers who use drugs (Lau et al., 2017).\nLeft behind children\nSelf-hatred, sadness, and fatigue can develop as part \nof depression in left-behind children (Li et al., 2021).\nMental illness\nIt can develop due to depression, anxiety or stress \n(Kotera et al., 2021).\nIt can develop due to depression with suicidal intent \n(Borentain et al., 2020).\nIt can develop in those suffering from borderline personality disorder (Mou et al., 2018)\nNegative life experiences\nIt can develop in those who are exposed to negative \nexperiences with parents and peer victimization \n(Xavier et al., 2016)\nSexual abuse\nIt can develop due to being a victim of sexual abuse \nas a child (Collin-Vézina et al., 2021).\nSexual abuse by sibling\n It can develop in the victims of sexual abuse by their \nsiblings (Tener and Dafna, 2021).\nTowards self-image \nIt can develop due to a distorted self-image (Jalali-\nFarahani, 2021) that itself can have multiple causes, \nfor example, eating disorder and self-criticism \n(Mantilla, 2015) or bodyweight shame (Carter et al., \n2021).\nTowards some aspect of self\nSelf-Hatred may be limited to one aspect of the self, \nfor example, this may include hatred towards the \nhabit of smoking (Amato, 2021), proneness to crying \n(Millings, 2016) or the word ‘obesity’ if the subject is \nobese (Atkinson, 2016).\nSele-perceived hatred\nVictims may perceive being hated, for example, \nexperiencing self-perceived hatred due to \nacculturation stress (Atteraya and Madhu, 2021, \nIorga et al. 2020 and Shan et al., 2020).\nHatred towards inanimate objects\nAccording to these studies haters can develop hatred \ntowards inanimate objects or events for several \nreasons.  They are mentioned in alphabetical order \nbelow. \nBrand\nHatred can develop towards business brands and \nmarket products (Husnain, 2021), (Pantano and \nEleonora, 2021)."

The above described organisation of \nresults is data driven and it is one of the pragmatic \nways in which I was able to present the findings. \nThe major themes that were identified on thematic \nanalysis of 113 studies included targets of hatred, \nreasons for development of self-hatred, self-perceived \nhatred, reasons of hatred towards other humans and \ninternal reasons for development of hatred. Medical \nresearchers all over the world are obviously working \nin varied environments, cultures, circumstances \nand have unique personal and academic interests. \nHowever, it appears that regardless of the \ncircumstances or the background they all appreciate \nthat hatred and hateful mind-sets exist and that \nefforts are needed to understand various aspects \nof hatred. From a medical and psychiatric point of \nview, they seem to make use of scientific approaches \nlike psychological, psychopathological, neurological, \nneurobiological and physiological approaches etc. \nto understand the subject matter.  Among targets of \nhatred, the medical researchers are keen to explore the \nreasons for self-hatred too. Exploration of self-hatred \nis useful especially in understanding its development \nin depressive illness that may lead to subsequent self-\nharm and even suicide. Hatred is also reported to have \ndeveloped towards inanimate objects or historical \nevents. It can be a person’s inner thoughts, feelings, \nemotions, interpretations, approaches or attitudes \nthat can lead to the development of this mind-set. \nOr it can be external reasons, for example, the kind \nof environment, peer group, background, culture, \neconomic situation or society that one is exposed to. One major reason that leads to the development of \nhatred that stands out across studies is the intolerance \ntowards the difference that others may present with, \nnamely, difference in race, in ethnicity, gender, sexual \npreferences, religion, ideology, regional background, \nstatus of illness, personal habits or age are some of \nthe recurrent themes that are reported. With regards \nto environmental factors, and given the time of cross-\nsectional data collection, the importance of online/\nvirtual environments and practices are highlighted \nacross studies. During the COVID pandemic when \nreal life contact was decreased and online virtual \ninteractions increased significantly, researchers had \nthe opportunity to study the patterns and behaviours \nthat led to the development of hateful behaviours and \nmind-sets in the virtual world, especially on virtual \nsocial media platforms. \nIt appears that the findings of this review are in \nkeeping with the findings that others have quoted on \nvarious platforms. For example the online website \ntitled ‘Understanding and overcoming hate’ (https://\nwww.overcominghateportal.org) offers a list of \nmultiple categories and kinds of hatred. According to \nthis website Every-Day Hate includes peer rejection, \nbullying, mocking, teasing, social exclusion and \nostracism. Discriminative-Hate can be carried out \non the basis of gender, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity, ethnicity, nationality, family heritage, \nsocioeconomic status (class), regional location, \nparty affiliation, looks, hair length, clothes, body \ntype, disability, weight, and age. Hate on the basis of \nDogmatic Beliefs (isms) is carried out on the grounds \nof ideologies, nationalism, exceptionalism, manifest \ndestiny, fundamentalism, literalism, millennialism, \nand McCarthyism.

The manifestations of \nCollective-Rage include group-activated violence, \n(hazing, wilding, gang rape, riots), (lynch mobs; \nvigilante justice), (ethnic violence, hate crimes), \nmass hysteria leading to massacres (i.e., Rwanda \nGenocide, witch trials), terrorist acts, suicide \nbombings and witch hunts. The manifestation of \nAbuse of Power includes death squads, rebel and \nstate-run paramilitary, mercenary violence, police \nbrutality, secret police, rendition, denial of civil \nliberties and rights and torture.  Oppression like hate \nmanifests as autocratic authoritarian regimes, forced \ncollectivization, fascism, theocracy, kleptocracy, \noligarchy and plutocracy. And finally, the Extreme \nCruelty on Mass Scale manifests as deliberate \nannihilation, atrocities, torture, eliminationism, \nmassacres, human trafficking, war crimes, crimes \nagainst humanity and genocide. \nComparing the findings of this review with the \ncategories appearing on the website it appears that \nmedical researchers are reporting many of these \nforms and categories of hatred. However, there are \nsome categories like self-hatred and self-perceived \nhatred  that are not mentioned on other forums but are \nan area of special interest for medical/mental-health \nresearches. I did not come across any contradictions \nin findings of this review to the findings on other \nforums, for example, in the above mentioned website. \nHowever for medical researchers the biological, \npsychological and social understandings of these \nmatters appear more pertinent than understanding \nthe political or historical aspects of the same. \nNonetheless, it seems that medical researchers are \nneither oblivious nor blind towards the non-medical \naspects that are sometimes an integral part of the \nbigger picture. \nMultiplicity of meanings\nI found that the medical researchers are interested in \nseveral aspects of exploring hatred and use the same \nword for numerous meanings. It is nearly impossible \nto summarise them under discrete types. However, \nthe emerging categories following analysis of initial \ncoding of all included studies provide an opportunity \nto broadly understand that when medical researchers \nuse the word hatred, then what are they aiming for? \nTo fully understand the meaning of the same word, \nthe background, broader aim of the study and context \nof the discussion in which the word is used needs \nto be kept in mind.  Without that, any conclusion \ndrawn about the meaning of hatred may lead to a spurious outcome. This multiplicity of meaning \nfinding agrees with numerous categories and kinds \nof hatred outlined on the website ‘Understanding \nand overcoming hate’ . This systematic literature \nsearch provides the opportunity for us to appreciate \na variety of opinions that have been incorporated \ninto the data pool across a longer duration of time. \nOn one hand, the opinions of individual authors can \nbe understood in detail, and on the other, a broader \nviewpoint emerges by combining the acquired \nknowledge from individual studies. \nSelf-perceived hatred and Self-hatred\nThere were a couple of themes that were identified in \nmedical literature and were not commonly reported \nin other sources. One of these themes was that of \nself-perceived hatred. For example,  studies carried \nout by Atteraya et al., (2021) and Shan et al., (2020) \non students belonging to a variety of nationalities \nand ethnic backgrounds reported that students \ncan perceive hate and rejection in the new host \nculture that they join for their academic needs. This \nperception appears to be the part of acculturation \nstress that they experience. This is a unique theme \nthat suggests that hatred is more like a mindset that \npeople can develop towards how they perceive they \nare treated and what they internally consider what \nhatred is.  \n About fourteen authors talk about self-hatred \nthat subjects experience for a variety of reasons. \nFor example, some recurrent emerging themes \nfor the generation of self-hatred are in the context \nof depressive illness and in the context of repeat \nself-appraisal of body image. However, other \nthan that, there are some unique reasons for the \ndevelopment of self-hatred that are highlighted by \nthis literature review. For example, Stevens et al., \n(2019) described that non-offending paedophiles are \na group of individuals that are attracted to children \nbut nevertheless suppress their attraction. They \nare reported to develop self-hatred as a result of \nexperiencing such feelings. In case of self-hatred in \nchildren, three articles, including those written by \nRhodes et al., (2017), Collin-Vézina et al., (2021) and \nGijzen et al., (2021), highlight that it is the childhood \nphysical abuse, childhood sexual abuse and \nchildhood depression that leads to its development. \nChildhood depression appears to be a recurrent \nemerging theme that may lead to development of \nself-hatred in children."

      "text": "92\nGLOBAL PSYCHIATRY ARCHIVES  — Vol 6 | Issue 2 | 2023Hating others\nHating inanimate objects\nIt seems people can develop a hatred towards almost \nanything and anyone. This may include other objects \nand other people. The inanimate objects can be \nhated for various reasons for example, Tonetto et \nal., (2016), reported that people can develop hatred \ntowards their cars after an appraisal. Whether it is \none’s body image that is appraised, one’s own self \nthat is appraised  or if it is an inanimate possession, \nthis negative appraisal reinforces the generation of \nhatred. Some children reported to have developed \nhatred towards vegetables as a dietary option, Leak \net al., (2017).\nEvents that lead to hatred of others\nHatred tends to manifest following exposure to \nsome important and usually stressful personal or \nsocial event. For example, one repeatedly reported \nevent that led to the generation of hatred was the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Out of 59 studies that dealt \nwith hatred towards others, 15 studies reported \nthe development of hatred due to COVID-19 \npandemic. One reason for this obviously is that the \ncross-sectional data was collected when the world \nwas still going through the impact of COVID-19, \nand it was an area of interest for medical \nresearchers at the time. However, at the same time \nthe other aspect was that COVID-19 generated \nunprecedented stress, anxiety, vulnerability, \nscarcity of resources and increased competition \nto receive the required help and health care from \nshared common resources.   For example, Erasmus \nreported that professionals carrying out critical \ncare triage can possibly develop hate towards elderly \npatients when work stresses are increased due to \nextra work generated by a pandemic (Erasmus, \n2020). Nishimura et al (2020) reported that the \nCOVID-19 pandemic caused stigmatization and \nhatred against Health Care Workers (HCWs), \nwhich led to increased prevalence of burnout in \nthem. Hall et al., (2021) described experiences of \nthose AIDS (HIV positive) patients who tested \npositive for COVID-19 too, the majority regarding \ntheir HIV diagnosis as having a more profound \nimpact on their lives compared to being affected \nby the pandemic but found similarities between \nCOVID-19 stigma and HIV-related stigma. Other \nsignificant events reported by authors that led \nto the generation of hatred were the UK Brexit movement (Dalle et al., 2020) and US presidential \nelections of 2016 (Hackett et al., 2020). \nCognitions that contribute towards hatred\nNine articles reported on the role that cognitions \nplay in the generation of hatred. For example, \nthe role of Dehumanisation is discussed by \nfour different authors in a variety of scenarios \n(Kramer et al., 2021) (Mendelsohn et al., 2021) \n(Simpson and Robert 2015) and (Stern and \nAlexandra, 2021). Nonetheless, in addition to \nthat, medical researchers have reported some \nother cognitive patterns too that are related to \nhatred. For example. Bélanger (2021) reported \nthat ideologically obsessed individuals are easily \nthreatened by information that criticises their \nideology, which in turn leads to hatred and \nviolent retaliation. Tobore and Tobore (2021) \ndescribed ‘Mental representation block’ (MRB). \nAccording to them, because of the brain’s energy \nefficiency evolutionary adaptations, all learning \nfollowing memory consolidation, reconsolidation, \nand repeated reinforcements or strengthening \nover time, results in a phenomenon called MRB. \nThe implications of this block include cognitive \nbiases and hatred including homophobia, and \ntransphobia. \nAttitudes, emotions, and sentiments that contribute \ntowards hatred\nIn addition to emotions, medical researchers are \ninterested in exploring around attitudes, emotions, \nand sentiments too that lead to the generation of \nhatred.  For example, Cichocka et al (2017) described \nthat after controlling for self-esteem, narcissistic self-\nevaluation was positively associated with the social \ndominance orientate, that leads to hatred of others. \nGheorghiu et al (2021) reported that immigrants \nfrom low-status or poorer countries (Poland, India) \nare more likely to be perceived as encroaching on \nthe majority group’s entitlements than those from \nhigh-status or richer countries (Germany, Australia). \nHoskin and Rhea (2020) reported that sources of \noppression underlying many forms of violence today \n(e.g., anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes, Incel attacks, sexual \nviolence, transgender murders) are all symptoms of \nthe same underlying social prejudice: femmephobia. \nGervais et al (2017) reported that sentiments are \nfunctional networks of attitudes and emotions. \nDistinct sentiments, including hate serve both \nbookkeeping and commitment functions within \nrelationships."

      "text": "93\nGLOBAL PSYCHIATRY ARCHIVES  — Generation and manifestation of hatredSocial issues that lead to development of hatred and \ncollective hatred\nMedical researchers are interested in exploring and \nunderstanding social reasons for development of \nhatred too. For example, Martin and Julia (2020) \nwho are teachers, carried out a survey on students \nmarching for social justice. They reported that issues \nof gender equality were of great concern to the \nmarchers, in particular, issues related to economic \nand social equity for example including inequality \nof the salary among genders. Whilst exploring the \nreasons for the development of collective hatred, \nSakki et al (2021) reported that it was the spread \nof populist rhetoric through humour that led to \nthe mobilization of collective hatred, encouraging \na sense of moral superiority in groups during the \nUS presidential election campaign in 2016. Whilst \nexploring the group-hatred, Weisel et al (2015) \nreported that outgroup hate can play an important \nrole towards development of group hatred, depending \non the degree of enmity between the groups, whether \nit involves imposing negative externalities or \ndenying positive externalities, and whether conflict \nis morality-based. \nPsychoanalytic approaches towards understanding \nhatred\nOn the subject of hatred, medical researchers \nare interested in exploring the reasons for the \ngeneration of hatred employing psychodynamic and \npsychoanalytical approaches. Kravis and Nathan \n(2017) applied Kierkegaard’s concept of ‘levelling’ to \nthe dynamics of envy, particularly as they come into \nplay among psychoanalysts doing clinical analytic \nwork. The `digital reality principle´ is introduced as \na way of conceptualizing an aspect of the hatred of \nthinking and certain envious responses to distinction. \nIn another example, through a detailed analysis \nof a clinical example, Perelberg and Rosine (2016) \nexamines Bion’s distinction between hysterical \nhallucinations and psychotic hallucinations and \nformulates their own hypothesis about the distinctions \nbetween the two. Their paper suggests that whilst \npsychotic hallucinations express a conflict between \nlife and death, hysterical hallucinations express the \nconflict between love and hate. \nRole of online resources towards the generation of \nhatred\nAt least nine studies covered the role of a variety of online platforms that contribute to the development \nof hatred. It appears that the virtual world is unique \nin several ways making it distinct and sometimes \na dangerous environment that may lead to the \ndevelopment of hatred. For example, Salminen et \nal (2020) carried out the classification of online \nnews on a news channel and reported that hateful \ncommenting, also known as ‘toxicity’ , frequently \ntakes place within news stories in social media when \nsensitive topics are discussed. Average toxicity of \ncomments varies by topic. Selkie et al (2016) reported \nthat most commonly witnessed online behaviours \nthat lead to or manifest as cyberbullying included \n“posting degrading comments or hate speech” and \n“posting explicit or unwanted pictures” . According \nto Tynes et al (2016),  the reasons for online hate \nactivity, includes the amount of time spent online, \ntraditional, and online racial discrimination, \nand adolescent adjustment (including depressive \nsymptoms, anxiety, and externalizing behaviours). \nUyheng, and Kathleen (2020) collected online \nconversations around the COVID-19 pandemic and \nreported that ‘Bot activity’ was linked to higher hate \nin the US and the Philippines during the COVID-19 \npandemic. The findings of this review suggest \nthat virtual world scenarios are equally capable of \ncontributing towards the generation and spread of \nhatred as real-world ones.  \nContributions from the current study\nThis study highlights that the systematic review \nof medical literature could be a good source to \nunderstand the variety of aspects of hatred. With the \nbackdrop of existing knowledge, the current study \nbrings a variety of approaches and opinions together \nthat suggest that medical researchers are keen to \nunderstand ‘hatred’ from different perspectives and \npoints of view. It appears that some are interested \nin understanding the internal reasons at the level of \ncognitions, attitudes, sentiments, and personalised \nmeanings of the subjects that develop hatred, whilst \nothers are keen to explore the external reasons that \nmay lead to its development. The findings of the \nreview suggest that various different forms of hatred \nsurfaced, or some already existing manifestations of \nhatred intensified following some significant global \nevents. In addition, this study also highlights the latest \nonline (virtual) reasons that lead to the development \nof hatred that seem to have some similarities with \nreal world patterns but with some uniqueness that \nare specific to online interactions only."

      "text": "94\nGLOBAL PSYCHIATRY ARCHIVES  — Vol 6 | Issue 2 | 2023CONCLUSIONS\nThe word `hatred´ is used in medical literature in \na multiplicity of meanings that range from using \nit in its literal sense to describe a subtle attitude \nsuch as a phobia-philia relationship, or to describe \na unique outcome that is generated as an interplay \nof several different kind of factors. These may \ninclude cognitions, behaviours, social interactions, \nattitudes, sentiments, developmental backgrounds, \npsychodynamic interactions with others in real and \nvirtual worlds etc. It may be ignored as another day-\nto-day attitude and paid little attention, for example, \nsomeone using the word hatred to describe the \ndisliking of his car. However, on the other hand, it \nmay manifest as negative expressions, for example \nof raging dehumanising contempt and disrespect \nthat may be accompanied with extreme actions \ntowards what is hated. It appears that hatred is more \nlike a mind-set that people can develop towards \nthemselves, towards others and towards inanimate \nobjects or situations too. Fear, anger and disgust are \nprimary emotions (that we are born with); human \npsyche is naturally prone to several inevitable \ncognitive errors; human thought is subjected to \nunavoidable logical fallacies; and human ego cannot \navoid utilising unhealthy ego-defence mechanisms. \nEvery child is born in a family and culture that has \nits own unique background and history. Therefore, it \nappears that we humans are prone to the generation \nof the hateful mindset as an unavoidable outcome \nin a variety of scenarios. It seems that depending \non the background of the person or the group, their \nenvironment and circumstances and the intensity \nof the stress that one is exposed to, the generation \nof the hateful mind set will vary. There are several \nother factors that contribute towards its generation. \nKeeping these generational patterns in view, it \nwould be reasonable to say that an early detection \nand addressing the early warning signs towards \ndevelopment of the hateful mind-set would be \nhelpful for ourselves and for others. As the word is \nused in several different meanings, the background \ninformation, context and overall scenario of the \ndiscussion needs to be kept in mind whilst attempting \nto draw any meanings about the use of hate/hatred in \na verbal or written expression. In each case where the \nword `hatred´ is used, needs to be approached with \nepistemic curiosity and in some instances, it may \nneed detailed epistemic inquiry to fully comprehend \nthe meaning of this word in any given expression. \nMore similar kind of research would hopefully bring \nmore insights into the subject with time. LIMITATIONS\nThis literature review took a cross-sectional approach \nfor data collection at a specific point in time. There \nare multiple studies that are added to the same data \nbase ever since the information was collected for this \nstudy and during the course of data interpretation, \nwrite up and publication. Choosing from the most \nrecently added studies from 2015 onwards in PubMed \nwas initially to keep the focus on contemporaneous \nstudies. However, it was realised after the initial data \nwas collected that even older studies were added at \nPub Med. As the data was already collected, I decided \nto mention this pitfall in the limitations section \nrather than changing the entire research strategy and \ncarry out data collection again.  \nMOTIVATION AND DEDICATION\nThis study is dedicated to Mrs Talat Afzaal, my \nprimary school (Divisional Public School Faisalabad, \nPakistan) teacher who lost her life in a terrorist \nattack in London, Ontario, Canada on 6th June 2021. \nMrs Afzaal was 72 years old.  The motivation for this \nstudy came to reflect on the reasons that go through \nthe mind of people who perform acts of hatred, like \nterrorism. The Canadian government immediately \ndeclared the incidence as an act of Islamophobia \n(Jiwani, 2022). It appears that Mrs Afzaal and \nthree of her family members were apparently killed \nbecause of the attire that they were wearing. If \nNathaniel Veltman had had the opportunity to meet \nMrs. Afzaal, I am sure he would have appreciated \nthat she was an unsuitable stereotyped candidate \nexcept for her attire. Following a road traffic accident \nand having undergone plastic surgery it was difficult \nfor her to face the society with the scars on her face, \nthough she never gave up fulfilling her professional \nresponsibilities.  In the early 1980s culture of \nFaisalabad (Pakistan), when a military dictator had \nimposed martial law rules restricting the freedom of \nwomen, it was not easy for a woman to work as a \nschoolteacher. It was difficult for any family to face \nthe conservative community in that culture where \nthe woman of the house works, and the family relies \non her wage.  She herself was educated, and she \nprepared her children to choose higher education. \nShe was a disciplinarian and would insist on rules to \nbe followed as an essential virtue whilst teaching us \nin the classroom. She was able to take the initiative in \nher sixties and embrace change to emigrate out of the \ncountry to a different culture. In order to understand \nmore about the social circumstances that she was"
