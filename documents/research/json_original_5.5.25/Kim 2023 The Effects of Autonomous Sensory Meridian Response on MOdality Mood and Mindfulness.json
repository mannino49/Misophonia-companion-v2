Lee1, 3\n1College of Journalism and Communications, University of Florida\n2Department of Communication, School of Creative Arts and Letters, Flagler College\n3Department of Advertising and Public Relations, Klein College of Media and Communication, Temple University\nAutonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a sensory phenomenon in which individuals experience\na speci ﬁc tingling sensation that arises in the scalp, travels across the spine, and induces a feeling of relax-\nation and well-being in response to particular audio and visual stimuli. However, the underlying mechanism\nof how each element of ASMR works to in ﬂuence users ’psychological responses needs more empirical\ninquiry. To address this gap in prior research, two experimental studies were conducted to examine theeffects of multimodal (audiovisual) and unimodal (audio and visual) ASMR videos on cognitive absorption,\nmood, and state mindfulness. Study 1 results revealed that multimodal ASMR video leads to higher absorp-\ntion than a unimodal ASMR video. Moreover, absorption mediated the relationship between multimodal\nASMR on mood and state mindfulness relative to audio-only unimodal ASMR. Study 2 supported the results\nof Study 1, ﬁnding that the multimodal ASMR video (audiovisual) leads to the highest absorption, state\nmindfulness and enjoyment.\nPublic Policy Relevance Statement\nIn general, the ﬁnding of this study shows that autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) with\naudio and visual modalities are associated with positive mood and mindful experiences. This provides\nvaluable insights for guiding trends on social media, with an emphasis on understanding how modality\nshapes the psychological impact of ASMR. More speci ﬁcally, this study adds a valuable asset in the ﬁeld\nof ASMR, which consumption of ASMR could in ﬂuence public mental health and well-being.\nKeywords: ASMR, modality, mood, mindfulness\nWhat happens when someone whispers in your ear? What about the\nsound of eating food or the crisp turning of a page? Each of these\nseemingly disparate stimuli has something in common: they arefrequent triggers for a unique phenomenon known as the autonomoussensory meridian response (ASMR; Barratt & Davis, 2015 ;\nS. D. Smith et al., 2017 ). Scholars describe ASMR as a tingling, static-\nlike sensation that arises in the scalp and travels across the spine. Theexperience of ASMR is anecdotally described to bring a pleasurable,comfortable, or even arousing sensation to the body ( Poerio, 2016 ).\nPerhaps it is not surprising then that video hosting sites have recentlyseen the rise of many user-created videos dedicated to eliciting the\nASMR experience. According to Pew Research Center ( van Kessel\net al., 2019 ), the term “ASMR ”among English language videos on\nYouTube had a 450% boost in views, thus attesting to the popularityof the ASMR genre.\nMany ASMR videos are often marketed by their creators with titles\nand keywords such as “cozy, ”“hypnotic, ”“relaxing, ”“satisfying, ”or\n“tingling ”(Barratt & Davis, 2015 ). Labels such as these seem to sug-\ngest that ASMR videos have a potentially positive impact on moodamong viewers. With that said, few studies have yet to be conductedthat empirically test the effects of ASMR videos on outcomes such asmood, so it is unclear if the bene ﬁts that users seek from these videos\nare actually being ful ﬁlled. The empirical question thus arises: do\nASMR videos have a causal effect on outcomes commonly associatedwith ASMR video viewing such as mood or state mindfulness?Moreover, although some people prefer ASMR visual triggers overaudio triggers and vice versa ( MasterClass, 2021 ), there have not\nbeen any empirical studies that examined the separate effect ofaudio and visual triggers within ASMR content. Accordingly, the cur-rent study aims to test how audio and visual modality in ASMR eachaffect absorption, mood, and mindfulness.\nThis question holds clear practical implications, yet there is also the\npotential for theoretical innovation through the study of ASMR videos.Previous literature on uses and grati ﬁcation (U&G) theory suggests\nthat people can have a variety of motivations for media use such as\nMinJi Kim https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2598-9033\nNo funding was received for this study.

      "text": "social interaction, information seeking, entertainment, passing time,\nconvenience, opinion expression, information sharing, mood manage-ment, and relaxation, to name just a few ( Bowman & Tamborini, 2015 ;\nPentina et al., 2016 ;Ruggiero, 2000 ;E. M. Stevens & Carpentier,\n2017;Whiting & Williams, 2013 ). Particularly relevant to ASMR, a\nmore recent study suggested sensory grati ﬁcation as another motiva-\ntion to engage with media ( Harrison et al., 2019 ).\nConsistent with U&G s theory, Harrison et al. (2019) media sen-\nsory curation theory suggests that people strategically seek out mediato regulate their senses and maintain a comfortable sensory environ-ment. For example, individuals who are stressed might seek outASMR videos that feature relaxing stimuli whereas those with lowarousal levels might seek out ASMR videos that titillate the senses.In general, ASMR offers triggers that are both auditory and visual innature. Initial exploratory research on ASMR experience suggeststhat some viewers felt the tingles mainly through the audio compo-\nnent but not visual, or vice versa ( Kovacevich & Huron, 2019 ). This\nraises the following questions: Does ASMR still elicit a favorableeffect when received through a single channel? If ASMR effectsare not observed when a single channel is used, is it possible thatmultimodality is a potential boundary condition for theoretical per-spectives like media sensory curation theory?\nTo test these possibilities, two experimental studies were conducted\nto examine how exposure to different forms of ASMR (audio-only vs.visual-only vs. audiovisual) affects mood, state mindfulness, andabsorption. Study 1 ( N=884) and Study 2 ( N=150) were both con-\nducted online with between-subject experimental designs.\nLiterature Review\nWhat Is ASMR?\nAmong the ﬁrst ASMR video to be posted on a YouTube channel\nwas named WhisperingLife in 2009 ( Richard, 2016 ). The YouTuber\nwas one of the ﬁrst ASMR artists (ASMRtist) who created a whispering\nvideo with the speci ﬁc purpose of bringing relaxation to the body. Since\nthen, various types of ASMR content have been uploaded on mediaplatforms to give viewers a tingling sensation. Popular ASMR triggersinclude hair cutting, massaging, clinical role-play, playing with slime,tapping objects, and eating ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ). These audiovisual\nstimuli have the potential to pro vide rich, multimodal perceptual expe-\nriences, such as synesthesia. Synesthesia is a phenomenon where indi-viduals experience an unrelated secondary sensation to a particularsensory stimulus ( Hubbard & Ramachandran, 2005 ). For example, peo-\nple experiencing synesthesia may feel relaxed or show higher levels ofabsorption ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ), which increases people ’s accep-\ntance even toward negative emotions and lets them enjoy music thatevokes negative emotions ( Hall et al., 2016 ).Ahuja (2013) found that\none of the most popular ASMR content, role-playing, lets the viewerbe absorbed in the video. However, how certain modalities and absorp-\ntion are related is uncertain in the context of ASMR.\nWhy Do People Watch ASMR?\nAccording to U&G theory, people use media with various moti-\nvations including information seeking, social interaction, passingtime, entertainment, relaxation, managing stress, communicationfacilitation, and convenience ( Bowman & Tamborini, 2015 ;Katz\net al., 1973 ;Palmgreen & Rayburn, 1979 ;Papacharissi & Rubin,\n2000 ;Pentina et al., 2016 ;Ruggiero, 2000 ;E. M. Stevens &Carpentier, 2017 ;Whiting & Williams, 2013 ). In addition to these\nmotivations, Harrison and colleagues recently argued that peoplealso seek media for sensory grati ﬁcation and regulation. Based on\nthese two theories, the current article posits that ASMR is a mediacontent that people use for relaxation and sensory grati ﬁcation.\nThis argument can be backed up by previous ASMR studies that\nhave been conducted in the ﬁeld of neuroscience. Previous functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging experimental studies found that ASMRvideos stimulated brain activity in sensorimotor areas connected tosleep, senses, vision, emotion, and attention ( Lochte et al., 2018 ;\nS. D. Smith et al., 2017 ,2019). The activation of these brain regions\nincluding the prefrontal cortex, striatum, insula, and amygdala suggeststhat ASMR experiences involve a complex interplay between sensoryprocessing, emotional regulation, and social cognition. Speci ﬁcally,\nthe activation of the insula and amygdala re ﬂect the intensity of\nASMR experiences while the activation of the prefrontal cortex and stri-\natum re ﬂect the reward value of ASMR modalities. Overall, these study\nﬁndings provide important insights into the neural basis of ASMR,\nshedding light on the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon.\nMultimodality, Sensation, and Mindfulness in ASMR\nOne way to consider the impact of ASMR is to recognize that\nASMR videos employ multimodal content. Many studies ofcomputer-based communication compare the social and psycholog-ical effects of different modalities such as visual and audio, but thepossible impacts of media formats such as digital games and hyper-text that combine multiple modalities into one have not been com-pared much in the past work. In general, multimodal experiencesare more engaging in processing information through multisensory\nperceptions ( Sundar, 2008 ). Since multimodality reduces uncer-\ntainty by facilitating the sense-making process and deliveringmore precise information, multisensory channels foster better learn-ing (Ritterfeld et al., 2009 ).\nBased on sensory curation theory, contemporary audiovisual\nmedia are now capable of providing kinesthetic sensations such asproprioception (awareness of self-movement) and vestibular sensa-tion (awareness of gravitation forces) ( McLaughlin et al., 2001 ).\nThe theory also claims that media devices help people reach an opti-mal level of arousal by creating an environment to maintain sensorybalance ( Seckman et al., 2017 ). Audiovisual stimuli in ASMR,\nwhich are usually made with high volume, repeated sound, andrepeated visual action satisfy the ﬁve senses ( J. Stevens et al.,\n2015 ) and consequently increase absorption into media.\nTheﬁrst exploratory online survey by Barratt and Davis (2015)\nrevealed that most people found ASMR videos relaxing and usedASMR to sleep, relieve stress, and maintain a positive mood. Amore recent experimental study by Fredborg et al. (2018) discovered\nthat compared to the control group who watched non-ASMR videos,those who watched ASMR videos reported higher levels of mindfulattention awareness and mindful curiosity. However, to our knowl-edge, there are limited studies that explore whether viewingASMR videos have a causal effect on outcomes commonly associ-ated with absorption or state mindfulness, nor have such studiestested the role played by different modalities used in ASMR.\nAlthough there is a drastic increase in the public interest in ASMR\nand emotions, studies on how different modalities of appealingmedia content affect mood are limited. Mood management theory(Zillmann, 1988 ) predicts that individuals strive to minimizeKIM AND LEE 2This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly."

As absorbing media content is known tobe an effective method to provide an enjoyable experience to mediausers ( Green et al., 2004 ), the ASMR experience may lead to similar\nresults given its potential for promoting absorption. Previousresearch found that people exposed to music-induced musical stim-ulation increased heart rate, recovery rates, respiratory depth, andskin conductance response ( Salimpoor et al., 2011 ). These results\nshow that audio has a strong in ﬂuence on people ’s feelings and\nthat it can also lead to emotional therapy.\nNot only audio but visual stimuli also have an effect on mood.\nSoft fascination is a term that describes people ’s mixed feelings of\nfascination and grati ﬁcation when looking at a stimulating visual\nobject ( Kaplan, 2001 ). Watching stimulating objects effortlessly\ncan allow viewers to get a chance to meditate and introspect(Berman et al., 2008 ). If viewers were to use only a single modality\nwhen watching ASMR content, will it still elicit a favorable effect?\nThus, the following hypotheses are posited:\nHypothesis 1: Exposure to a multimodal (audiovisual) ASMR\nvideo will lead to more positive (a) mood, (b) state mindfulness,and (c) absorption relative to the no ASMR control condition.\nHypothesis 2: Multimodal (audiovisual) ASMR video will lead to\nmore positive (a) mood, (b) state mindfulness, and (c) absorptionrelative to unimodal ASMR video (audio-only or visual-only).\nHypothesis 3: The effect of multimodal ASMR on (a) mood and\n(b) state mindfulness will be mediated by absorption.\nStudy 1\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 966 responses were collected. Of that, those who\nresponded to the questions with no variation in answer choices(0=variance ) were removed ( N=34;N=932). The exclusion cri-\nteria also removed outliers with the shortest and the longest durationsrecorded upon completion of the survey (less than 2 min, more than\n10 min) ( N=3;N=929). Finally, anyone who failed the manipula-\ntion check was removed, resulting in a ﬁnal sample size of 884. The\naverage age of participants was 37 years old (ranged from 18 to 84years old) with 54.8% of the sample identifying as male.\nStimulus\nAmong different types of ASMR videos, we chose a slim mixing\nvideo (known as Hong Giang DIY Slime), one of the most popularand most viewed videos on social media including YouTube. Thevideo features chunks of colorful slimes being mixed in a bowl.This 50 s-long video was edited to be one of three versions; audio-\nvisual (original), visual-only, or audio-only. Unimodal (one sensory\nstimulus) videos had either the video with no sound (visual-only) oraudio with a static image (audio-only).\nMeasures\nMood. Participants completed the Brief Mood Introspection\nScale (BMIS; Mayer & Gaschke, 1988 ) that assesses participants ’current mood based on their responses to 16 adjectives (Cronbach ’s\nα=.87;M=4.94, SD=1.00), from 1 ( deﬁnitely do not feel )t o7\n(deﬁnitely do feel ). Answer choices included eight positively-worded\nand eight negatively-worded adjectives such as “lively, ”“happy, ”\n“gloomy, ”and “tired. ”Negative words were reverse-coded and the\nmean score of 16 emotions was used as an indicator for the presentmood.\nCognitive Absorption. Cognitive absorption was adapted from\nAgarwal and Karahanna (2000) , with 11 out of 31 items selected to\nmeasure the perceived track of time (temporal dissociation), thelevel of attraction (focused immersion) during the story, heightenedenjoyment, and curiosity toward the ASMR content (Cronbach ’s\nα=.89;M=4.24, SD=1.31). The items were measured on a 1 –7\nscale, ranging from strongly disagree tostrongly agree .Q u e s t i o n s\ninclude statements like “time appeared to go by very quickly during\nthe video ”and “I felt absorbed in the video. ”\nMindfulness. The state-mindfulness scale ( Tanay & Bernstein,\n2013 ) was adapted to assess how ASMR experience can affect state\nmindfulness. Speci ﬁcally, this study used one subcategory of mind-\nfulness; psychological-only impact (15 out of 21 items; Cronbach ’s\nα=.92; M=4.08, SD=1.25). The questions include “I noticed\npleasant and unpleasant emotions ”and “I was aware of different\nemotions that arose in me. ”\nProcedure\nThe study was conducted in compliance with the Institutional\nReview Board of the primary investigator. Participants wererecruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Each participantwas randomly assigned to one of four conditions; one non-ASMRslime-making video for a control group, and three slime ASMR vid-eos in different sensory modalities; one audiovisual, one audio-only,\nand one visual-only. Participants voluntarily signed an informed\nconsent form to start participating in the online survey. To controlindividual differences in ASMR experience, questions asked howmuch one knows about ASMR and how often one watches ASMRvideos. A non-ASMR control video was an instructional videoshowing how to make a slime with raw materials, with a narrationin the background explaining the role of each ingredient and thesteps to mix them. Three other conditions showed one of three vid-eos with different levels of modalities; audiovisual, visual-only, oraudio-only. At the end, participants completed a demographic ques-tionnaire and received their code for compensation.\nResults\nCell sizes are uneven across conditions due to an error during data\ncollection that oversampled subjects in the “audio-only ”condition.\nThe control variables of ASMR knowledge, ASMR experience,\nand mindfulness experience were not signi ﬁcantly different across\nconditions (see Table 1 ).\nManipulation Check\nIn order to ensure that participants in each condition watched the\nassigned ASMR videos by experiencing the right sensory stimuli,the following question was asked: “When you watched the video,\nwhat did you see or hear?. ”The data (available on OSF; Kim &\nLee, 2021 ) with wrong answers to the manipulation check ( N=\n45) were removed ( N=884).ASMR AND 3M S 3This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly."

      "text": "Hypotheses Testing\nThree one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted\nto test H1, which predicted that multimodality of ASMR wouldimprove mood, state mindfulness, and absorption relative to a noASMR control. A one-way ANOVA indicated that there was no sig-niﬁcant difference between multimodal ASMR and non-ASMR con-\ntrol on mood, F(1, 354) =.33, p=.568, h\n2\np=.001; state\nmindfulness, F(1, 354) =1.91, p=.168,h2\np=.005; and absorption,\nF(1, 354) =.03,p=.869,h2\np=.000 (see Table 2 ).\nH2 predicted that multimodal ASMR will show higher absorption,\nstate mindfulness, and more positive mood than unimodal ASMR.The post hoc comparisons showed that there was a signi ﬁcant differ-\nence only between multimodality and audio-only conditions onabsorption; F(2,699) =15.719, p,.001,h\n2\np=.043. That is, audio-\nonly stimulus led to the lowest absorption ( M=3.90, SD=1.19). It\nalso shows that visual-only stimulus ( M=4.39, SD=1.27) and mul-\ntimodality ( M=4.47, SD=1.36) ASMR videos were not different in\nabsorption. Mood, F(2,699) =2.04, p=.13, and state mindfulness,\nF(2,699) =1.97, p=.14, were not signi ﬁcantly different between\nmultimodal and unimodal ASMR videos.\nH3 predicted that absorption would mediate the relationship between\nASMR exposure and the outcome variables of interest. To that end, aseries of simple mediation models were conducted using thePROCESS macro Model 4 (mediation model; Hayes, 2013 ) with\n5,000 bootstrapped samples and 95% bias-adjusted con ﬁdence inter-\nvals. Given that the preceding analyses revealed that only the audio con-dition varied signi ﬁcantly from control, each model was run with\naudio-only as the independent variable (0 =control and 1=audio\nASMR ) while dummy coding and statistically controlling for subjects\nin either the visual-only or multimodality conditions.\nThe indirect effect of audio ASMR on mood through the indirect\npathway of absorption was statistically signi ﬁcant, 95% CI [ −.25,\n−.10]. Audio ASMR decreased absorption ( −.60, p,.001)\nwhich was subsequently related to increased mood (.29, p,.001).\nThe direct effect of audio ASMR on mood independent of absorp-tion was ns,p=.73.The indirect effect of audio ASMR on mindfulness through the\nindirect pathway of absorption was also statistically signi ﬁcant,\n95% CI [ −.40,−.17]. Audio ASMR decreased absorption ( −.60,\np,.001) which was subsequently related to increased mindfulness\n(.47, p,.001). The direct effect of audio ASMR on mood indepen-\ndent of absorption was also statistically signi ﬁcant, p=.01.\nDiscussion, Study 1\nThe results of Study 1 revealed several interesting ﬁndings. First,\nthe study ﬁnding indicated that there were no differences between\ncontrol and multimodal ASMR on absorption, mood, and state mind-fulness. Speci ﬁcally, slime ASMR videos with audiovisual triggers\nneither enhanced people ’s emotional state nor moment-by-moment\ncognition awareness than a common slime advertising video. Theabsence of a main effect in comparison between control and multi-modal ASMR video indicates that the slime ASMR videos mayhave weak impacts on mood change or state mindfulness or the cho-sen control video was too immersive in terms of visual and audioimpacts. This result is different from prior work ( Barratt & Davis,\n2015 ) which found that participants who viewed various types of\nASMR content such as whispering, crisp sounds, and slow move-ment reported a heightened ﬂow state, increased absorption, and\nmood enhancement. As participants in the current experimentalstudy were asked to watch only one type of ASMR, slime ASMRvideo, some participants might have been disturbed by the slimeASMR video. In fact, Barratt and Davis revealed that people experi-ence pleasant feelings with different types of triggers becauseASMR is not a universal experience.\nSecondly, the study ﬁnding indicated that the multimodal ASMR\nvideo leads to higher absorption than a unimodal ASMR video.Particularly, the result suggested that watching an ASMR videowith both audio and visual triggers increased absorption than watch-ing an ASMR video with audio-only stimuli. This ﬁnding echoes\nprevious research in that if some sound, listened in isolation withoutany visual orientation, may drive people to imagine unpleasantimage and fails to induce the positive effect ( Barratt & Davis,\n2015 ). In the context of slime-touching ASMR video, the slimy,\nsticky, and squeaky sound may have hindered people from gettingcognitively absorbed into the video. People only experience enjoy-ment when they get cognitively transported into media ( Green et\nal., 2004 ). Hence, unpleasant experience with the content leads to\na decrease in absorption. Accordingly, based on the previousresearch and current study ﬁndings, it can be concluded that for a\nslime ASMR video, audio-only modality of ASMR was not effectivewithout the visual modality when it comes to enhancing absorption.\nThird, study results indicated that absorption mediated the rela-\ntionship between multimodal ASMR on mood and state mindfulnessrelative to audio modal ASMR. A multimodal ASMR video wasTable 1Mean Scores of ASMR Modality on ASMR Knowledge, ASMR Experience, and Mindfulness Experience (Study 1)\nControl variables Control ( N=182) Audiovisual ( N=174) Visual-only ( N=183) Audio-only ( N=345)\nASMR knowledge 2.99 (2.10) 3.13 (2.14) 3.02 (2.09) 3.08 (2.12)\nASMR experience 2.01 (1.60) 2.24 (1.77) 2.07 (1.68) 2.18 (1.86)\nMindfulness experience 7.03 (4.00) 6.78 (4.26) 7.69 (3.91) 7.23 (3.99)\nNote.M(SE); ASMR =autonomous sensory meridian response.\nTable 2\nOne-Way ANOVA, ASMR Modality on State Mindfulness, Absorption,a n dM o o d( S t u d y1 )\nDependent\nvariablesControl\n(N=182)Audiovisual\n(N=174)Visual-only\n(N=183)Audio-only\n(N=345)\nSM 4.07 (0.09) 4.25 (0.10) 4.02 (0.09) 4.03 (0.07)\nABS 4.50 (0.10) 4.47 (0.10) 4.39 (0.10) 3.90 (0.07)BMIS 5.05 (0.07) 4.98 (0.08) 5.00 (0.07) 4.84 (0.05)\nNote.M(SE); ANOVA =analysis of variance; ASMR =autonomous\nsensory meridian response; SM =state-mindfulness; ABS =absorption;\nBMIS=Brief Mood Introspection Scale.KIM AND LEE4This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly."

However,\ncompared to multi-modal ASMR video, participants who wereless absorbed in the audio-only ASMR video reported better moodand increased state mindfulness. Without the visual modality, partic-ipants would pay the most attention only to the sounds. Then, thedisturbing noise from mixing the slimes associated with low absorp-tion seems to have distracted viewers, which consequently led to bet-ter mood states. This contradictory outcome could also be explainedby the avoidance coping mechanism that people use when they faceunexpected and disturbing sensations in life, such as a misophoniacoping strategy ( Potgieter et al., 2019 ). In order to avoid dealing\nwith stress from the slime noise, participants could have reducedtheir attention level, which eventually led to less negative emotionalexperiences.\nThe study has both theoretical and practical implications. Although\nthe emergence of the ASMR community calls for the great interest in\nacademia, only a few studies have examined people ’s tingling sensa-\ntion in response to particular audiovisual stimuli. Theoretically, ﬁnd-\nings of the study extend previous literature in that multimodal mediacontents provide a more immersive experience than unimodal content.Also, the ﬁndings of the study generate theoretical insights for the\nmedia sensory curation theory ( Harrison et al., 2019 )i nt h eA S M R\ncontext by showing that people use media to reach the optimal levelof arousal. Practically, the study suggests that avoiding the use of dis-turbing audio stimuli and visual stimuli is the key to create effectiveASMR content. As the current study found that slime touchingsound was unpleasant, this concludes that not all sounds are pleasingto hear, even in the ASMR context. Thus, those who intend to developeffective ASMR content must use more enjoyable sound that increasepeople ’sm o o d .\nThere is a limitation that must be taken into account despite the\nresults. It should be noted that the current study ’s use of a speci ﬁc\ntype of slime ASMR may have shown different results from othertypes of ASMR videos in terms of the soothing and relaxing effectof sound expected from the most ASMR videos. As the audio-onlycondition in our slime ASMR video led to a decrease in mood, thesqueaking sound of touching and mixing the slime may have beenunpleasant and uncomfortable. With this limitation in mind, we con-ducted Study 2 to test the effect of each modality in different types ofASMR videos.\nStudy 2\nThe needs for broader applications and generalization of the ﬁndings\non the effects of modality in ASMR vi deos from Study 1 led to an addi-\ntional study, with the aim to test ho w modalities work in the different\ntypes of ASMR videos. We assumed that ASMR videos can be catego-rized into different types based on the levels of soothing and relaxingexperiences the videos provide to viewers. Thus, we chose multiple dif-ferent types of ASMR videos and pretested the impacts on viewers.Then, the ﬁnal two ASMR types were chosen for the main stimulus\nin Study 2; whispering and crunchy (eating) videos.\nAccordingly, we hypothesized that two different ASMR videos\nwill lead to different levels of emotion and mindful experiences,as well as absorption and relaxation. On top of that, we expectedto see the consistent ﬁndings as Study 1 showed, speci ﬁcally, that\nmultimodality will lead to higher level of absorption and mindfulexperience compared to unimodality (visual-only and audio-only).Setting the experimental conditions just the same as they were in\nStudy 1, we proposed these fourth hypotheses:\nHypothesis 4: The multimodal (audiovisual) ASMR video will\nlead to stronger (a) absorption, (b) enjoyment, (c) state mindful-ness, and (d) relaxation, relative to unimodal ASMR videos(audio-only or visual-only).\nResearch Question 1: How are relaxing type and irritating type\nof ASMR videos different on (a) absorption, (b) enjoyment, (c)state mindfulness, and (d) relaxation?\nResearch Question 2: Is there any interaction effect between\nmodalities and ASMR types on (a) absorption, (b) enjoyment,(c) state mindfulness, and (d) relaxation?\nMethod\nPretest\nParticipants. Participants ( N=87) were recruited on MTurk\nfor the pilot tests. Participants were randomly assigned to watchone of eight 20-s ASMR videos and rated how much they thoughtthe video was soothing, relaxing, irritating, and uncomfortable.\nStimulus. Eight ASMR triggers we chose for the pilot test\nincluded tapping, scratching, liquid sound, crinkly, whispering,slime, crunchy (eating), and sticky eating videos ( Sharkey, 2019 ).\nWe used videos created by one famous ASMR YouTuber namedGibi ( Gibi ASMR, 2016 ), in order to control any confounding effects\n(different individuals, angles, and performance styles, which may\naffect the experiences). In the pilot tests, the whispering video was\nrated as the most relaxing ( M=3.28, SD=1.28), and the crunchy\n(eating) video was rated as the least relaxing ( M=2.62, SD=1.38)\n(Gibi ASMR, 2018 ). Based on the result (two ASMR types) of the\npilot test, two new ASMR videos (20 s each) were created for themain study (see Figure 1 ). Both whispering and crunchy (eating) vid-\neos were edited from different parts of one long ASMR video, createdby the YouTuber Gibi to control the angle, lighting, background, andthe appearance of the person who appeared in the video. The whisper-ing video features the YouTuber Gibi talking with a low and soft voice,whereas the crunchy (eating) video features the person eating hard-textured snacks while making crunchy noises.\nManipulations. With these two ASMR videos, we edited and\ncreated more videos in different levels of modalities. The factorialdesign of Study 2 was Modality (3: Audiovisual vs. Visual-Onlyvs. Audio-Only) ×ASMR Type (2: Whispering vs. Crunchy).\nAccordingly, a total of six videos were used to test the experiences.\nParticipants\nA total of 150 responses were collected. The average age of partic-\nipants was 39 years old (ranging from 22 to 78 years old) and 48%were male. Participants all passed the manipulation check by answer-ing the question, “When you watched the video, what did you see or\nhear?. ”This question was intended to check the modality of the videos\nthey were assigned to watch; audiovisual, visual-only, or audio-only.\nProcedure\nParticipants were recruited on MTurk.

In terms of visual presentations, whispering videos fea-ture the YouTuber talking to the viewer about the macaron she likes,with frequent eye contact with the camera. Crunchy (eating) videosinvolve fewer eye contact but show the YouTuber eating some cookieswith satisfying facial expressions. In terms of the sound, whisperingvideos include a low and quiet tone of voice that the YouTuber whis-pers to the viewers, while crunchy (eating) videos include a relativelylouder sound while she chews and cracks the hard cookie. Participantsin the audiovisual condition watched videos with sound and visual,while those in unimodal conditions watched the same videos withonly one sensory stimulus, either sound or visual-only. Upon comple-tion of watching the video, participants completed a postexposurequestionnaire and then received their code for compensation.\nMeasures\nCognitive Absorption. Cognitive absorption was adapted from\nAgarwal and Karahanna (2000) . Four among 31 questions in the\nscale were selected and modi ﬁed (Cronbach ’sα=.875) and mea-\nsured on a 1 –5 scale, ranging from strongly disagree tostrongly\nagree . Questions include statements like “I felt absorbed in the\nvideo. ”and “The story aroused my imagination. ”\nMindfulness. State-mindfulness scale ( Tanay & Bernstein,\n2013) was adapted to assess how ASMR experience can affect state\nmindfulness. Speci ﬁcally, this study selected ﬁve among 21 items\nin the original scale (Cronbach ’sα=.890). The questions include\n“I noticed physical sensations come and go. ”and “I changed my\nbody posture and paid attention to the physical process of moving. ”\nMood. Participants rated enjoyment using three items in the\noriginal scale on the 5-point differential emotions scale (DESscale; Izard, 1972 ) from 1 indicating not at all to 5 indicating very\nstrongly affecting their feelings (Cronbach ’sα=.902). The items\ninclude three current emotions; “delighted, ”“happy, ”and “joyful. ”\nThe measures can be found in Appendices A –C.\nRelaxation. Relaxation was measured using four items from two\nsubsections including “physical relaxation ”and “at ease ”from Smith\nRelaxation States Inventory 3 (SRSI3; J. C. Smith, 2001 ). The chosenquestions are “I felt at peace,\n”“My muscles were so relaxed that they\nfelt limp, ”“If e l ta te a s e , ”and “My hands, arms, or legs were so\nrelaxed that they felt warm and heavy ”(Cronbach ’sα=.719).\nResults\nEach condition, the sample sizes were evenly distributed across\nconditions ( n=25 in all six groups; 150 participants in total).\nParticipants reported their ASMR knowledge, ASMR experience,and mindfulness experience; none of them were signi ﬁcant across\nconditions (see Table 3 ).\nHypothesis 4 predicted that multimodal (audiovisual) ASMR\nvideo would lead to stronger (a) absorption, (b) enjoyment,(c) state mindfulness, and (d) relaxation relative to unimodal ASMRvideo (audio-only or visual-only). H4 was fully supported; themain effect of modality w as statistically signi ﬁcant on absorption,\nF(2, 144) =21.136, p,.001, state mindfulness, F(2, 144) =11.812,\np,.001, enjoyment, F(2, 144) =10.669, p,.001, and relaxation,\nF(2, 144) =6.967, p=.001 (see Tables 4 and5).\nRQ1 was proposed to see if two different ASMR types have dif-\nferent impacts on absorption, state mindfulness, mood, and relaxa-tion. The only signi ﬁcant differences between whispering and\ncrunchy (eating) ASMR videos were measured on the level of relax-ation, F(1, 144) =9.301, p=.003. More speci ﬁcally, whispering\nvideos ( M=4.52, SD=.98) were reported to be more relaxing\nthan crunchy (eating) videos ( M=3.97, SD=1.30). Thus, RQ1\nwas partially supported.\nLastly, RQ2 expected some level of an interaction effect between\nmodality and ASMR type.

      "text": "between modality and ASMR type on absorption, state mindfulness,\nmood, and relaxation.\nGeneral Discussion\nStudy 2 tested H4, RQ1, and RQ2 by conducting a between-\nsubjects experiment. Unlike Study 1, Study 2 excludednon-ASMR videos and directly compared the effects of multi-\nmodal and unimodal ASMR videos on absorption, state mindful-\nness, enjoyment, and relaxation. The result revealed that, in linewith Study 1, audiovisual ASMR video induced higher absorp-\ntion, state mindfulness, enjoyment, and relaxation compared toaudio-only and visual-only ASM R videos, supporting H4. This\nﬁnding echoes and extends previous ASMR studies ( Barratt &\nDavis, 2015 ;Del Campo & Kehle, 2016 ;Fredborg et al., 2018 ;\nMcErlean & Osborne-Ford, 2020 ), which found the positive effect\nof multimodal ASMR on mindfulness, absorption, and mood.\nRegarding RQ1, results indicated that relaxing ASMR video (whis-\npering content) induced higher relaxation compared to irritatingASMR video (crunchy food eating content). However, there was nodifference between these two ASMR videos on absorption, state\nmindfulness, and enjoyment. This ﬁnding is in alignment with previ-\nous studies by Barratt and Davis (2015) ,Del Campo and Kehle\n(2016) , as well as McErlean and Banissy (2018) ,w h i c hf o u n da n\nassociation between misophonia and ASMR. Misophonia is hatredtoward a particular sound that may cause an uncomfortable physiolog-ical response. ASMR contents with repetitive irritating sounds (e.g.,repetitive scratching, chewing, vacuum cleaning, laughing, and crisp-ing) increases annoyance and displeasure and decrease relaxation.According to the U&G theory, people use media for various reasons,\nand mood management and relaxation are critical motivations behind\nmedia consumption ( Bowman & Tamborini, 2015 ;Pentina et al.,\n2016;Ruggiero, 2000 ;E. M. Stevens & Carpentier, 2017 ;Whiting\n& Williams, 2013 ). Our work further expands the literature on\nASMR and misophonia in that repetitive displeasing sounds maydecrease relaxation, but do not necessarily impact content enjoymentand cognitive absorption.\nLastly, regarding RQ2, study ﬁndings revealed that there was no\ninteraction between modality and ASMR type on absorption, statemindfulness, enjoyment, and relaxation. As there was a strongmain effect of modality type on dependent variables, this showsthat in order for media users to fully enjoy and get absorbed intothe ASMR content, audio and visual triggers must coexist. As peoplehave different tastes toward ASMR video types, more emphasis infuture research should be placed on the modality type than the con-tent type ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ).\nThe result of the study has indicated that the modality of ASMR\nvideo contents is effective in predicting the level of absorption. Inaddition, Study 2 found that state mindfulness and mood could be\nassociated with modality effects, wi th the spotlight on multimodal-\nity as having the strongest impact on immersive psychologicalexperiences. Besides theoretical implications, Study 2 offers prac-tical implications as well. Adding on to Study 1, Study 2 resultssuggest that ASMR content creators should focus more on c reating\nrelaxing content that can appeal to a b roader audience. As the ﬁnd-\ning showed that whispering ASMR content with audiovisual trig-gers was most enjoyable, ASMRtist should f ocus on producing\nthis type of content to ful ﬁll media users ’content consumption\nmotivations.Table 4Two-Way MANOVA, ASMR Modality and ASMR Type on Absorption, State Mindfulness,Mood (Enjoyment), and Relaxation (Study 2)\nIndependent variable Dependent variable Fd f Signi ﬁcant Partial η2\nModality Absorption 21.136 2 .000* .227\nMindfulness 11.812 2 .000* .141\nMood 10.669 2 .000* .129\nRelaxation 6.967 2 .001* .088\nASMR type Absorption 0.523 1 .471 .004\nMindfulness 0.052 1 .819 .000\nMood 0.398 1 .529 .003\nRelaxation 9.301 1 .003* .061\nModality ×ASMR Type Absorption 0.771 2 .464 .011\nMindfulness 0.670 2 .513 .009\nMood 0.640 2 .529 .009Relaxation 0.122 2 .885 .002\nNote.

      "text": "Nevertheless, this study implies some limitations in that it failed to\nﬁnd the impact of ASMR types on different psychological experi-\nences. Although we found different levels of relaxation perceivedfrom different ASMR videos, the level of relaxation was not associ-ated with absorption, mindfulness, and mood. Accordingly, focus-ing on the theory of U&G theory, we suggest future research totest more ASMR types based on the level of different psychologicalaspects beyond relaxation, such as personal needs for belongingnessand desire for social presence, which could be associated with indi-vidual differences of the current emotional status. Furthermore, it isimportant to note that ASMR content created by different ASMRtistsmay induce varying degrees of relaxation, mindfulness, and emo-tional valence, potentially impacting the outcomes of our study.Therefore, to ensure the generalizability of our ﬁndings, future\nresearch should use a more diverse sample of ASMR content pro-duced by various ASMRtists.\nReferences\nAgarwal, R., & Karahanna, E.
