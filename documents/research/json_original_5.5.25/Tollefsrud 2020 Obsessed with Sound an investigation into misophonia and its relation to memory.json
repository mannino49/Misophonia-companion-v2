The obtained rating s were used to divide \nitems  into two stimuli groups for a recall memory test. Part 2 had fifty-four participants \ncomplete the OBQ -44, A-MISO -S, and a recall memory test. No correlation was found \nbetween scores on the OBQ -44 and A -MISO -S, failing to support the OCD -Misophonia \nlink.

      "text": "1 \n  \nCHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION   \nContext of the Problem  \nMisophonia , also known as selective sound sensitivity syndrome , is typically \ndescribed as an affective sound -processing disorder characterized by extremely advers e \nemotional reactions to otherwise innocuous sounds  (Schröder et al., 2017) . The \noffending stimuli can  include any low level and repetitive sound; however, they are \ntypically sounds generated by the mouths of other people  (Sanchez & Silva, 2017) . \nTypical auditory triggers include crunching, slurping, popping gum, lip-smacking, \nsniffing, throat clearing, and heavy breathing  (Taylor, 2017) . \nThe source and commonality of the offending stimuli result in a near-consta nt \nstate of unease when interacting with others, causing significant impairment across \nmultiple social domains  (Sanchez & Silva, 2017) . Age of onset is typically in early \nchildhood around 12  years old , although it can manifest later in life  (Cavanna & Seri, \n2015) . While there is no widely accepted prevalence estimate, most  studies investigating \nthe issue estimate the prevalence to be around 3% in the general population  (Taylor, \n2017) . As of this writing, Misophonia is not officially recognized as a disorder by the \nDSM -5 or the ICD -10, due in  part to the ongoing debate about how to diagnose and \nclassify the condition  (Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2018) .  \nStatement of Purpose  \nGiven the understudied and impairing nature of the disorder in question, further \ndevelopments in the professional knowledge on the topic  woul d be of great benefit to an \nunderserved population .

The fact that the characteristic symptom of Misophonia is irrational reaction s \nto stimuli suggest s that there may be a cognitive aspect to the mechanics underl ying the \ncondition. There is little existing literatur e exploring the impact of Misophonia on \ncognitive functions directly ; however, there exists research that indirectly examines \nsome cognitive feature s of Misophonia. The two most prevalent observations i nto the \ncognitive impact of Misophonia include descrip tions of abnormal attention to triggers, \nand a possible role of memory systems  (Brout et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2013) .  \n Previous studies, specifically those looking to describe the Misophonic \nexperience , have found that Misophonics often self -report  a feeling of “hyper -focusing”  \non trigger ing Stimuli . An example of such a report comes from a case study performed \nby Johnson et al ., where participants described a tendency to focus on triggers to the \ndetrime nt of their ability to concentrate  on anything  else (Johnson et a l., 2013) . This idea \nof abnormal attention as a characteristic of the condition is also lent additional support \nby the condition’s frequent comorbidity with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder \n(ADHD) , though  no research has been conducted on the attentional implications of \nMisophonia specifica lly (Cavanna & Seri, 2015) ."

      "text": "4 \n \n \n Related to the abnormal attention claim, is the idea that memory systems may \nplay a funda mental role in Misophonia symptomology. In their initial writings on \nMisophonia, Jastrebo ff and colleagues proposed that Misophonic responses may be \npartially explained by defects in the neuropsychological systems for memory, emotion, \nand learning (Brout et al., 20 18). Follow up studies using fMRI data have found \nabnormal activation in brain areas responsible for long term memory, suggesting a \nmemory component to the condition (Kumar et al., 2017a) . Existing research on the role \nof memory in Misophonia has mainly focused  on the neurology of memory, with little to \nno literature demonstrating  the functional impact that such a rela tionship might have.  \nAttention and Memory  \nThe relationship between memory and attention has long been recognized, \nresulting in several  assumptions and observations.  For instance, it is commonly accepted \nthat focusing attention on a stimulus aids memory encoding and increases  the \nprobability of successfully recalling the stimulus in the future  (Chun & Turk -Browne, \n2007) . This influence of attention on memory is validated in part by neuroimaging \nstudies showing evidence that attentional control mechanisms appear to influence \nepisodic and  perceptual encoding  (Chun & Turk -Browne, 2007) . Just as attention has \ndemonstrated a significant role in  memory encoding, the inverse has also been observed ; \nspecifically, memor y has been shown to optimize attention and perception (Chun & \nTurk -Browne, 2007) . This impact of memory o n attention is partially validated by \nevent -related st udies and contextual cueing tasks showing evidence that attention can be \ndirectly cued by contextual memory (Chun & Turk -Browne, 2007) .

Their first line of thought  \npropose s that the limited capacity of memory systems necessitates a process for \ndetermining what information to encode, and suggest that attentional network s act as the \ndeciding force (Chun & Turk -Browne, 2007) . Chun & Turk -Brown use experimental \nobservation s showing that division of attention during memory encoding inhibits \ndeclarative  memory formation as evidence for this first line of thinking.  \nChun & Turk -Browne further propos ed that people use past experiences (i.e. , \nmemory) to determine what stimuli to direct their attention to. This idea is supported by \nexperimental observation s demonstrating that important memory areas of the brain are \nrecruited during attention tasks (Chun & Turk -Browne, 2007) . The results of this review \nlead Chun & Turk -Brown to propose that some aspects of these two systems are so \nconnected they may reflect the same mental processes (Chun & Turk -Browne, 2007) . \nObsessive -Compulsive Disorder  and Misophonia  \nOCD , or “obsessive -compulsive disorder ,” is a condition primarily characterized \nby reoccurring obsessive th oughts and as sociated compulsive actions  (Myers et al., \n2008) . The obsessive thoughts experienced by t hose with OCD  are involuntarily \ngenerated and cause significant distress to the individual, and often invoke a need to \nperform a specific action or ritual, known as a compulsion (American Psychiatric \nAssociation, 2013) .

Part of t his support comes from the significant overlap in the \ncondition’s symptomology,  including the fact that both show advers e reactions to \nspecific stimuli, both produce similar stress and anxiety responses, both evoke \nfleeing/avoidant behavior, and both evoke compulsions  (Wu et al., 2014 ). It is also noted \nthat the negative reinforcement seen by Misophonic avoidant behavior is analogous to \nthe maladaptive behaviors shown in OC D (Wu et  al., 2014) . Further support is provided \nby several  studies finding links between the two conditions, includin g a tendency for \nOCD symptoms to increase with Misophonia symptoms  (McKay et al., 2018) .

Mean r ating s of individual items \ngenerally met expectations, with higher score s being assigned to items that were \nintuitively greater Misophonic triggers.  For example, words (Chew, Slurp, Munch , \nCrunch ) were the top four highest -rated items. These words in particular not only act as \nsome of the most visceral representations of the most common trigger noises (eating \nsounds ); they are  among  the words commonly used by Misophonics to describe triggers  \n(Kumar et al., 2017b; Taylor, 2017) . In contrast, the four lowest -rated words (Flutter , \nFizz, Kong, Bam ) do not represent common misophonic trigger s. These facts taken \ntogether act to facially validate the use of the selected items as Misophonic stimuli.   \n While  the majority of individual item’s triggering quality met expectations, some  \nresults were  surprising . The words  “clucking” ( M = 2.70) and “ clank” ( M = 3.00) \nreceived high tri ggering scores despite sharing no obvious ties to trigger sounds. \nGrammatical form  of some items also seemed to alter their rating, as seen with “ cluck” \n(M = 1.85) vs . “clucking” ( M = 2.70),  “ clap” ( M = 2.25) vs . “clapping” ( M = 2.45), \n“buzz” ( M = 2.55) v s. “buzzing” ( M = 2.70), “ moan” ( M = 2.90) vs . “moaned” ( M = \n2.95), and “ gurgle” ( M = 3.50) vs . “gurgled” ( M = 3.95).

The correlation of SDS scores with the A -MISO -S \nand the OBQ -44 su ggests that said scales measure some component of impairment \nbrought about by the disorders in question . Howeve r, a larger r2 between the A -MISO -S \nand SDS relative to that be tween the SDS and OBQ -44 suggested greater confidence in \nthe association between t he former pair  and suggest ed a lower sensitivity of the OBQ -44 \nto impairment compared to the A -MISO -S. \nMemory  Test \nThe memory te st revealed a reliable  effect of item type  (hypothesis 3)  but failed to \nshow the expected main effect of partici pant types (hypothesis 2) or expected interaction \nbetween levels of participant types and levels o f item types on item recall  (hypothesis 4) . \nThe author has produced several  possible explanations for these observations , which are \nas follows . Firstly, there was minimal variance in the severity of Misophonia symptoms \nin the sample tested, with the majority of Misophonics displaying moderate severity. This \nhomogeneity in Misophonic severity may have dampened any interaction between \nparticipant types and triggering quality on item recall. The inclusion of Misophonics with \nmore severe symptom s may result in the observation of the expected interaction.  \nSecond, the task demands of the memory test may have been too severe, resulting \nin participant ’s inattention during item presentatio n. More specifically, the n umber of \ntesting items used may have been excessive, a concern supported by comments left by"

As \npreviously described , despite being the most widely used Misophonia scale, there is little \nto no evidence for its validity, a fact that has prompted other researchers at the time of \nthis writing to begin work on more th oroughly validated Misophonia scales. This fact \nleaves ope n the possibility that the scale failed to separate the participants well enough to \nreveal any effect of Misophonia status on item recall.  \nDespite  issues with the memory test, it is worth noting t hat it was sensitive  to the \nconstruct of interest. This was evident in t he significant effect of item types (high vs. \nlow) on recall , which suggests that the memory measure is a valid method of \ninvestigatin g the cognitive and practical implications of memo ry relative to Misophonic \ntriggers .

Such a difference in response intensity would likely have affected the initial \nrating of items and the recal l rates of said items.   \nPart 2  \n A second concern is how there was no mechanism in place  to account for \nparticipant ’s inattention or distraction during item presentation , which could create a \nvariance in item recall removed from the properties of the items themselves .
