Following authors in this field, I distinguish two modalities of \nconsciousness: sentience, in the sense of being awake and capable  of feeling (e.g., basic \nsensations of hunger and thirst, pain) and,  second, cognitive consciousness, in the sense of  \nthinking and elaborating on  linguistic and imagery  representa tions . The physiological \ncorrelates of sentience are proposed to be the systems underpinning the dynamic control of \nbiochemical homeostasis, whil e the correlates of cognitive consciousness are considered to be \npatterns of bioelectrical activity in neural networks.

A r ecent manifesto signed by 58 researchers (Michel et al., 2019) reviewed \nchallenges for the application of theories of consciousness to the medical area, where new \ntherapies - such as transcranial Direct  Current Stimulation (tDCS) - have presented positive \nresults which existing theories cannot fully explain.

He reported the use of imaging technologies “to detect covert \nconscious awareness in patients who are behaviourally entirely non -responsive (e.g., \nvegetative, comatose) a nd even to allow some of these individuals to communicate their \nwishes and thoughts” (Owen, 2019, p. 6) .  \n Owen´s focus, in his outstanding medical work, was on ‘higher level’ cognitive \nconsciousness (e .g., higher functions involving symbolic language)  but - here I claim - the \nunderstanding of the ‘lower level’ processing underpinning sentience (as, for example, the \nsusceptibility to feeling pain in the presence of noxious stimulation) could be equally u seful \nfor medical diagnosis and therapy. The existence  of ‘two awareness networks’, one related to \narousal and glucose metabolism , and the other to cognitive representations of the \nenvironment, was mentioned by Laureys (2019) in the same conference. Seth ( 2019) \nexpanded the conceptualization of consciousness to require three categories: Level  \n(corresponding to arousal), Content  (corresponding to cognitive representation), and Self (a \nthird category, about the person being interoceptively aware of herself).  \n In this paper, I focus on the conceptual relation of  sentience and cognitive \nconsciousness, arguing for their different physiological correlates and the relevance of \nconsidering sentience in medical practice. The main hypothesis is that cognitive \nconscio usness depends on sentience , implying that more attention should be given to the \nneural correlates of sentience in medical diagnostics and therapy. The minimal requirement \nfor considering a person minimally conscious is, according to this line of reasoning , if she \ncan feel basic sensations such as hunge r, thirst and pain. The capacity of feeling is  here \nconceived as closely related to the capacity of dynamically controlling the physiological \nprocesses of homeostasis.  \nHigher -­‐level  capacities  related to con nectivity patterns of bioelectrical neuronal \nactiv ity in the neocortex , such as verbal or imagery thinking,  the retrieval of episodic"

Taking \ngeneral anesthesia as an example, if the main c riterion is not being able to feel pain, the \ngoal of the procedure would be broader than the loss of cognitive consciousness.  In some \ncases , the neu ral correlates of cognitive representations  may not  be the main target of \ntreatment, since they correspond t o a high -level specific ability  that is not necessary for \nlower level sentient experiences, which also deserve attention for proper medical and  also \nbioethical reasons.   \n \nConceptual Issues  \n The concepts of sentience  and cognitive c onsciousness , as well as related \nconcepts , such as affect, feeling  and qualia , have been  approached historically in several \ndifferent ways, resulting in their semantic ambig uity. Before e mbarking on the \ntranslational endeavour  of relating these concepts to medical procedures , some \nclarifications  and elaborations  on how the concepts are used here is needed.  \nAccording to the Merria m Webster Dictionary, the  term sentience  refers  to \n“feeling or sensation as distinguished from perception and thought ” \n(https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/ sentience ). This concept of sentience  can \nbe understood as potential  consciousness : the capac ity to feel  (proprioceptive and \nexteroceptive sensations, emotional feelings) and to have qualitative experiences , while \ncognitive consciousness  refers to  the actual experience of  thinking with mental \nrepresentations.  This concept of ‘cognitive consciousness’ stems from Baars (198 8, \nrepublished in Baars, 2019) and relates to ‘resonating’ neocortical activations in the \nDynamical Global Workspace  that processes conscious information.  \nIn affective neuroscience, sentience  refers to the affective drive  that makes  us \nconsciou s. Conscious affective experiences as pre -reflexive or vague sensations and \nemotions are classified as  ‘anoetic consciousness ’ (see discussion in Almada et al., 2013; \nPanksepp, 2005; 2010; Vandekerckhove and Panksepp, 20 09), while cognitive \nconsciousness  is conceived within the ‘noetic ’ and ‘self-noetic ’ types of consciousness"

Sentience  can \nalso be conceived as co-extensive to  the (Freudian) ‘unconscious ’, and similar to  a family \nof concept s mentioned by consciousness theorists, such as  Primary Consciousness  \n(Edelman, 2004) or the ‘pre-conscious ’ domain referred to by Velmans (2002)  and \nDehaene et al. (2006).   \nThe term ‘s entience ’ has been mostly used  in studies about animal consciousness . \nAnimal sentience  has been defined as “the minimal capacity (italics by APJ) to have \nsubjective experience of the qualities associated with external and internal sensations, as \nwell as affective and motivational s tates for phenomenal consciousness” (Allen and \nTrestman, 2016). According  to this definition , sentience  is not identified with full \nconscious activity, but with a “minimal capacity” that is manifested in different forms \nand to different degrees in differen t biological species , including ourselves .  \nThe usage of  a variety of  concep ts about  sentience  begins in Spinoza’s Ethics  and \nremains in  the contemporary approaches of Panksepp (1998) and Damásio (1999) . According \nto Spinoza,  “Between appetite and desire t here is no difference, except that desire is generally \nrelated to men insofar as they are cons cious of the appetite. So desire can be defined as \nappetite together with consciousness of the appetite” (Spinoza, Ethics, III Proposition 9, \nScholium).  In this a pproach, n ot only the appetite but all types of ‘striving ’ (Le Buffe, 2015)  \nare related to a general condition, the conatus , that corresponds to  the affective drive  \nbelonging to the domain of sentience . In th e above  quotation , the ‘desire’ is an  actual  \nconscious experience  (an emotional state directed to an object of thought)  in whic h the \nappetite is expressed . For instance, hunger is a type of  ‘appetite’ , while the ‘desire ’ of eating , \ne.g. bread with cheese and ham , is the conscious expression of the ‘appe tite’ directed to a \ncognitive object  of thought  (the sandwich) .  \nFollowing Spinoza’s distinction, I use  sentience  to refer to  the capacity  of feeling , a \ndispositional state  that contains a range of po tentialities , of which only a subset is made actual \nat each moment  in the consciousness of a person , depending on her interaction with the \nphysical and social environment. Where and when  there is attunement of the internal \ndisposition with the external affordance , then  a specific conscious cognitive or emotiona l \ncontent  is determined ; in other words, the cognitive  or emotional  content is not determined by \nthe affective drive  alone.  This distinction is important for scientific approaches , because \nscientists can measure  physiological  dynamic patterns underpinning the sentient capacity  but \ncannot measure  conscious  experience  (including the qualitative states – qualia  - attached to"

Information about first -person conscious experiences depends on \nverbal or non -verbal reports by the conscious su bjects, to be interpreted by the scientis t, on \nthe basis of her first -person perspective. Therefore, the study of s entience is within the ‘Easy \nProblems ’ conceived by Chalmers (1995), while explaining full c onsciousness is the ‘Hard \nProblem’.  \nIn Phenomenol ogy, sentience  implies  only the existence of a ‘here-and-nowness ’ (the \nterm ‘nowness ’ was used by Nunn, 2016 ) or a presence  (Seth et al., 2012 ) that is able to feel , \nbut without  the structured experiences  that we find in full conscious episodes.  In \nNeurosc ience , ‘feeling ’ (in the sense of  the term ‘sentience ’, as used here ) was recently the \nobject of a multi -author review , in which they added the qualification ‘physiological ’ (Pace -\nShott et al., 2019).  Physiological  feeling  processes  refer to the physiologi cal correlates of the \nsentience capacity  - such as the interoceptive loops between the central nervous system and \nthe whole body interacting with the environment – that result  in conscious  cognitive and  \nemotion al contents . The authors arrived at  the conclu sion: “changes toward and away from \nhomeostasis,  not only within the autonomic  nervous system but in all systems of the body  \n(e.g.,  metabolic,  cardiovascular,  immune) , contribute interoceptive i nformation to the CNS.  \nThe integrated output of multiple physi ological systems may provide highly complex inputs \nto central mechanisms that produce  (italics by APJ) the conscious experience of feelings,  \nmoods and emotions ” (Pace -Shott et al., 2019, p. 294) . In regard to my previ ous example of \neating bread with cheese  and ham, ‘physiological feelings’ correspond to the affective drive \n(the ‘appetite’ to eat ) while ‘conscious experience’ corresponds to the actual conscious \nexperience ; in the previous example, eating the  sandwich ( with pleasure , by carnivorous \npersons, w hile for vegans  the ham is disgusting ). \nIt is also important to note that ‘ physiological feeling’ , or physiological correlates of \nsentience , in this context , are not identical  to homeostasis  but relate to the reaction  or \nresponse  of living system s to chang es in homeostasis caused by sensory stimuli or other \nperturbations. The reaction  of the system leads to the formation of  consciously experienced \ncontents .

This reaction is the a ffective drive  that is typical of \nsentience;   \n3) The reaction produces  consciously experienced  qualia  (sensation s, affective  and \nemotion al state s), which may be anoetic  or noetic . Cognitive consciousness includes a quale  \ncalled ‘the feeling of knowing’ (Bu rton, 2008);  \n4) The conscious experience motivated by the above reaction triggers a process of \nthinking with mental representations  that we call cognitive consciousness , allowing the \nprojection  of representations supporting  adaptive actions  of the agent (t he ‘self’) in the \nenvironment (the ‘world’).   \nWhile the complexity of the concept of feeling has gone  almost unnoticed in \nconsciousness studies,  the very concept of consciousness  has been discussed intensive and \nextensively,  with a small contribution from this author  on definitional and taxonomic \napproaches  (Pereira Jr and Ricke, 2009; Pereira Jr. et al, 2010).  \nThe construction of the ‘phenomenal’ domain of conscious experiences, departing \nfrom the ‘cognitive consciousness’ model, was developed with the ‘t heater’ metaphor (Baars, \n1997, partially reviewed in Baars, 2019). Another approach to phenomenal con sciousness was \nconstructed from the combination of Phenomenology and Neuroscience, in the \nNeurophenomenological  approach. According to one of the branches of this approach, the \nProjective Theory (Velmans, 1990, 1993) re-elaborated by this author ( Pereira Jr., 2018) , the \nphenomenal domain  involves  temporal episodes in a  egocentric space structure  with \nqualitative states ( qualia ), and structured on  two project ed ‘poles ’, called Noetic  and \nNoematic  by Husserl, and renamed  the Sense of Self  and the Sense of World  (Pereira Jr., \n2018).  The use of ‘Noetic’ here is the same of Panksepp and colleagues.  \nIn Pereira Jr. (2018), t he Sense of Self is generated within the conscious experience; \nthe Sense of Self is the  concept  of the  entity (the “experiencer”) w ho feels and acts on the \nWorld. The Sense of World is composed of cognitive representations  motivated by - and \nattended according to - the affective drive , and then ‘projected ’ to the world of action.  The \nprojection  of the two poles by the nervous system, interacting with the environment,  form s \ncomplex spatiotemporal episodes  filled with qualia . These qualia are  composed not only of \nthe cognitive representations themsel ves (in the previous example, the conceptualization  of \nthe properties of  a sandwich ) but also of the expression  of the  affective drive:  the actual"

Sentience  refers to the  unstructured  ‘here-and-nowness’ with many potential \noutcomes , while cognitive c onsciousness  refers to  structured  conscious  episod es with a Sense \nof Self and a Sense of World , and filled with representations having  qualitative propert ies \n(qualia ). The consciously experienced qualit ies (qualia ; e.g. perceptual multimodal scenes ) \nare propert ies of the World in the first -person perspective of the Self.  For instance , my feeling \nof tooth pain is a property of the world as it is sensed by me ; in this case, the ‘world ’ includes \nparts of my body and everything else that I am  conscious  of, except  my inner  Self who \nexperiences them .  \nOn a side comment, I note that t he above  concept of cognitive consciousness is \ncontextual  or ‘embedded’ , because t he projection of the Self and the World require the ‘here-\nand-nowness’ being to  be able to ‘feel what happens ’ (Damásio´s expression) in the domain \nof interaction  with the envir onment , co-generating cognitive contents by means of perceptual \nprocesses, and/ or representing possible worlds on the basis of memories of previous \nexperiences .

The se theories  contrast with the traditional Cannon -Bard view of neural \nregulation of body -energy homeostasis , which is focused on internal feedback signals \nintegrated in the hypothalamus a nd brainstem (Shin et al., 2009). In the  broader  appro ach \nof Shin et al. (2009)  to energy homeostasis,  besides the activation of behavioral, \nautonomic, and endocrine pathways, “these internal signals encoding energy status have \nmuch wider effects on  the br ain, particularly sensory and cortico ‐limbic systems t hat \nprocess information from the outside world by detecting and interpreting food cues, \nforming, storing, and recalling representations of experience with food, and assigning \nhedonic and motivational value” (Shin et al., 2009). Agreeing wi th this statement , I also \nclaim that  sentience is not limited to subcortical structures, or to neocortical structures; \nrather it involves cycles of homeostatic control in the whole neural tissue , by means of an \naction on  the ‘chemical soup’ in which it is bathed  (considering that in current usage by \nbiologists ‘neural’ refers to the whole tissue formed by both neuronal and glial cells, also \nincluding the extracellular fluid and matrix).  \nCentral to the control of homeostasis , in plants and animals,  is the ro le of ionic \nwaves. They  are generated by changes in electrochemical brain activity, and feedback on \nthe activity (see Busikla et al., 2019). Although plants do not have specialized neuronal \nor glial cells, they display similar adaptive homeostatic mechanis ms: glu tamate -induced \ncalcium waves around the xylem and phloem (Toyota et al., 2018). These waves compose \nthe “plant neural system” that controls adaptive processes.   \nThe control of homeostasis  in animals , generating ‘physiological feelings’ , \ninvolves a large s ignaling network, which includes  interoceptive somatic loops by means \nof blood flow signaling, as indicated in Figure 1 ."

For instance, the \nexperience of pain protects us from aggravating an injury , and the experience of pleasure \nguide us towards survival and reproductive behaviors.  Cannon (191 5) further related \nemotion to the action of chemicals that control homeostasis in neural tissue (e.g. \nnoradrenaline). Giving an example, I mention thirst and satiation (Saker et al., 2014). \nDecrease of water concentrations in the body and proportional incr ease of  salt in the \nblood leads to signaling to neural tissue that generates the thirst sensation, which guides \nthe system to drinking behaviors and then the recovery of water -salt homeostasis. The \ningestion of water up to satiation is accompanied by a ple asant conscious  experience;  \n3) Ions are the vehicle for (biochemical ) allostasis in neural tissue (and other \ntissues), as reviewed by Rasmussen et al. (2020 ): “interstitial cations (K+, Ca2+ and \nMg2+) are not static quantities but change dynamically across  states such as sleep and \nlocomotion…these state -dependent changes are capable of sculpting neuronal activity; \nfor example, changing the local interstitial io n composition in the cortex is sufficient for \nmodulating the prevalence of slow -frequency neuronal  oscillations, or potentiating the \ngain of visually evoked responses… the brain uses interstitial ion signaling as a global \nmechanism to coordinate its comple x activity patterns, and ion homeostasis failure \ncontributes to central nervous system diseases af fecting cognitive functions and \nbehavior” (Rasmussen et al., 2020) ; \n4) Astrocyte transporters , astrocyte ionic  (Ca+/Na+) intracellular waves  and their \nextracellular effects (on K+ concentrations, Glu, GABA, and others)  compose a \nmechanism that control s brain tissue  homeostasis  (Verkhrats ky and Nedergaard, 2019) . \nThe release of  calcium  ions from  the endoplasmic reticulum of  astrocytes is central to the \nformation of these  waves.

In this section, I suggest several applications of this knowledge in \nNeurology.  \nWhen we are awake  and sentient , phys iolog ical mechanisms such as glial \ntransporters and calcium waves control chemical homeostasis , making  available \nsubstances like lactate, glutamate, noradrenaline, acet ylcholine , dopamine, serotonin, \nneuropeptides and many others , in concentrations that al low dynamic responses  to \nstimulation .

For instance , the domin ance of delta waves is typical of unconscious states \nin deep sleep, while a combination of faster rhythms and amplitude modulation in time – \nas revealed by event -related potentials - is typica l of conscious states (Pereira Jr. et al., \n2017).  \nAs the proper correlates of conscious ness extend beyond the most basic correlates \nof sentience , the former cannot be taken as a general parameter for the detection and \nintervention on the latter. A major co ncern  of medical procedures during general \nanesthesia, palliative care and clinical interventions to improve the quality of life  is if the \nperson being treated  can feel pain  in the presence of a noxious stimulus . The capacity  of \nthe person to feel pain,  even if  there is no noxious stimulus (and she is not consciously  \nexperienc ing pain ) belong s to sentience , while t he cognitive and emotional experiences of  \nactually  feeling pain belong to  the ‘phenomenal’ domain of consciousness .

If it is not cognitively represented, as in the case of \nvague  feelings or emotions, then we have an instance of anoetic  consciousness , but once \nwe give a  name  to the feeling or emotion, it becomes - a posteriori  – attached to a \nrepresentation.  This philosophical issue is relevant for Neurology in situations when a \nperson is asked to describe what she felt during a surgery  under general an esthesia . She \nmay give a  cognitive report, naming her sensations, on the basis of the memory that was \nformed and retrieved, although she had no cognitive representation of the feelings at the \noccasion  she experienced them.  \nThe representation of the object of experience (e.g. brea d with cheese and ham) \nbelongs to  the narrow branch of experience called  ‘cognitive consciousness ’. This high -\norder phenomenon cannot be taken as the general standard for neurological diagnostic and \ntreatment, because it cove rs only part of the physiologic al processes of conscious \nexperience. Taking sentience as the most basic capacity necessary for conscious experience \nallows a broader medical approach to the physiological processes that make consciousness \npossible.  \nGeneral a naesthesia  is often characteriz ed as a loss of (cognitive) consciousness , for \nexample, as the incapacity of forming memories of pain during a surgery.  However,  if the \nmain criterion is not being capable of  feeling pain , then its effects extend beyond the \nabsence of cognitive conscious experience of the medical e vent (e.g., invasive surgery)  and \nepisodic memory about what happened during the event. In other words, the goal of general \nanesthesia  – abolishing for some time, during a surgery, the capacity of feeling pain - \nwould be  broader  and more important  than the absence of cognitive consciousness; ‘not \nbeing able to feel pain ’ in the presence  of a strong noxious stimulation  implies  not only th e \nabsence of cognitive representations  of the pain, but  the absence of  any conscious  pain \nsensat ion or emotion .  \nAn important finding  in regard to the  physiological  correlates of general an aesthesia  \nand the corresponding loss of sentience  is the role of glial cells  in continuous transmission \nof hydro -ionic waves in neural tissue .

An additional finding impl ying that sentience  is a tissue phenomenon  \nrelatively independ ent of the neuronal spiking  is the  discovery that tissue electromagnetic \nwaves related to sentience can propagate without neuronal axonal transmission , pointing to \nthe involvement of the astrocy te network  (Chiang et al., 2019 ; Martinez -Banaclocha, \n2020 ).  \nAstroglial dysfunction , such as the defective propagation of ionic waves,  implies the \nincapacity to control the deviations from basal homeostasis towards recovering stabilit y – \nor, in other word s, the incapacity for allostasis  – corresponding , in the theoretical \nframework introduced here , to a loss of sentience.  The astrocytic syncytium  is the network \ncomposed by large populations of  astrocytes inter-connected by gap junctions, forming a \ncontinuu m ‘master hub’  in which  ionic waves propagate  (Pereira Jr. and Furlan, 2010) . The \nisopotentiality  of the astrocytic syncytium , allowing the flow of ions in all directions  upon \nlocal stimulation, is crucial for  allostasis  (Ma et al., 2016; K iyoshi et al., 2 018). If the flow \nis not isopotential, the consequence is that some parts of the brain are not integrated in the \nallostatic process, while other parts are overloaded. Considering the central role of \nastrocytes in brain allostasis , Verkhratsky et al. (2016)  concl uded for  “the pathogenic \npotential  of astrocytes in a variety of disorders, ranging from neurotrauma, infection, toxic  \ndamage, stroke, epilepsy, neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and psychiatric  \ndisorders, Alexander disease to neoplastic changes seen i n gliomas ”.  \nOne important neurobiological feature of energy usage in the brain is the fact that \nthe glucose carried in arterial blood flow is mostly delivered to astrocytes, not directly to \nneurons. Astrog lial cells process glucose from the blood  into the ‘lactate shuttle ’ (Pellerin  \net al., 1998; 2007 ) and deliver the product  (the lactate) to neurons, where it is further \nprocessed into ATP and cyclical AMP , for consumption in cellular metabolism  and in the \ndynamic control of homeostasis . This astrogl ial function is central to the differential \ncircadian cycle delivery of energy to neurons, corresponding to the functional distinction of \nnon-dreaming sleep and wakefulness. Research on neuron -astrocyte interactions in the last \ntwo decades has produced exp erimental evidence that the lactate that circulates in the \nextracellular milieu and reaches neurons ( Petit and Magistretti, 2006) supports the waking \nstate and related sentience. Considerations about how useful energy is processed in the \nbrain and used to reduce thermodynamic entropy  are central to  the understanding of the \npsycho physio logical states  of sleeping and dreaming (Hobson and Friston, 2012) .

According to Bojarskaitė et al. \n(2020) , calcium  signaling in astrocytes is “sleep -wake state specific” , which suggests that \nthe lactate shuttle and the resulting amplitude -increased calcium waves (up to a thres hold, \nbeyond which an epileptic seizure may happen) can be taken together as a biomarker for \nsentience . Ingiosi et al. (2020)  registered changes in astroglial calcium waves in REM, \nNon-REM sleep and wakefulness, showing (in three videos)  a sharp increase in the \namplitude and synchronization of the waves in the sle ep-wake fulness transition.  \nIn the transition from slee p to wakefulness, there is a sharp rise on the amplitude \n(vibrational kinetic energy) of calcium waves, as shown in videos 1 and 2 of the  cited  paper \n(Ingiosi et al., 2020) , making the system able to feel ( sentient ).  This phase indicates that \nthe system can “feel what happens”  but is not  itself  the correlate of a specific experienced \nfeeling. The correlates of specific feeling experiences appear in the next phases of the \ncalcium signaling during wakefulness, as in the case of  conscious  tasting experiences \nregistered with calcium imaging using two -photon microscopy and implanted microprisms \n(Chen et al., 2020.)  \nThe above findings have important impli cations for neurological diagnostics and \ntherap y. The connection between  lactate , astroglial calcium waves and the control of neural \nhomeostasis (Verkhratsky and Needergaard, 2019) is still not well known in the medical \ncommunity  but opens new possibilities of intervention.  For instance, l actate concentrations \nin cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples can be used in medical practice as a biomarker for \nsentience.  Needergaard and colleagues found ev idence for  what they called the \n‘glympathic ’ system , composed of channels for the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid  in \nneural tissues,  contacting glial cells in the brain . The above -mentioned ‘lactate shuttle ’ is \ncarried by th is system.  While we are awake  and sentient there is an increase of lactate \nlevels in  glympathic  pathways , while the lactate concentration decreases  when we are in \ndeep sleep  (Lundgaard et al. , 2017) . This system is critical for neurological evaluation of \nthe capacity of generating con scious states and experiences, because a defec tive flow of \nlactate in the glympathic system would impair sentience, while adequate levels of lactate \nduring wakefulness imply that sentience is intact.  \n Lactate concentrations a s biomarker s for sentience  provide a new technique to \nmeasure the minimal level of activity necessary for consciou s experience,  for people in the \n'vegetative' state .

As a working hypothesis, adequate lactate concentrations in \n‘vegetative’ state patients would indicate greater probability of recovering f ull \nconsciousness.  \n ‘Absence epilepsy ’ refers to the  loss of sentience  causing a loss of consciousness, \ndetermined  by events in the domain of neuron -astrocyte interactions (Diaz Verdugo et al., \n2019) . These events i nvolv e a defective function of GABA transporters in astrocytes \n(Crunelli et al. , 2013) , accompanied by  an increase in calcium waves (Fellin et al.,  2006)  \nand slow outward currents of  calcium  from  astrocytes  to neurons (Kozlov et al., 2006) . \nThese factors generate  an increase in the  amplitude of dendritic potentials and in axonal \nfiring rates  that result in  the well-known  ‘spike and wave ’ bioelectrical phenome non in \nepilepsy  (an increase in the amplitude in scalp EEG registers, displaying bioelectrical \npeaks) , clinically and experimentally measured for more than half a century . These findings \nhave inspired the s uggestion of new treatments for epilepsy  (Crunelli  et al., 2015)  - as well \nas for  degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s (Finsterwald et al., 2015)  \n- targeting the astrocyte network . The rationale for these proposals is that astroglia provide  \nfar more than a supportive system for neuron s, having psychophysiological functions such \nas supporting wakefulness, providing the control of homeostasis (or allostasis ), generating \naffective stat es experienced by the agent , and generating motivation for action.  \nOne of the major challengers in neurol ogical therapy is the suppression of  CNS \nprocessing of  somatic chronic pain.

In tDCE,  the part of the electric current that is not conducted by the skin or the skull \nis assumed to pass through the CNS tissue , moving  from one scalp location to another , thus \ninterfering with the dynamic patterns of  ionic waves  and having other effects (e.g. on \nprotein co nformation)  to genera te the desired therapeutic results. The type of interference \ncaused by the current is not well -know n but there are good morphological and \nphysiological reasons to believe that the transmission is not mediated by neurons, since \nthese ce lls do not form a con tinuum ; they are  rather  separated by synaptic clefts, in which \nthe transmission of signal s is chemical. The transmission of bioelectrical currents \nexclusively by the ‘chemical soup’ would be not sufficient to explain long -range \ndirecti onal phenomena. There fore, as the tDCE current find ways to move  between \n(relatively) long distances  through neural tissue, the most probable  pathway  is through  the \nchemical soup reaching the  astroglial network  (Monai et al., 2016; Monai and Hirase, \n2018) , because  these cells, contrary to neurons, are connected by gap junctions forming a \ncontinuum (Kiyoshi et al, 2020 ).  \nThere are many findings about the application of tDCE for the treatment of \nneuropathic pain (for a review, see David et al., 2018) and som atic abdominal  pain (e.g., \nBayer et al., 2019).  These treatments do not target the neocortical specialized circuits \nthought of as being the neural correlates of cognitive representations; they instead interfere \nwith dynamic bioelectric waveforms present in  neural tissue . \nIn neurological rehabilitation , targeting the whole neural tissue is also implied by \nthe use of rotating magnets in the treatment of isch aemia and stroke .

This \nfinding was forgotten for a long time but deserves to be recalled after a  research group \nfrom the Methodist Hospital in Houston (Texas, USA) found that powerful rotating \nmagnets are effective in the treatment of stroke and isch aemia  (Helekar et al., 2 018) . The  \ninference that can be made is that  the rotating magnets , although possib ly not direct ly \naffect ing conscious  cognitive  representations , do impact  the structures and functions  of \nneural tissue  that support sentience , thus making possible the recovery of  full conscious \nfunctions.

When we are \nawake, we are sentient – but may not be fully conscious or may suffer from mental \ndisorders that affect how we cons truct conscious episodes.  While neurological lesions \nand dysfunctions have their basis in  the impairment  or loss of sentience , disorders of \nconscious functioning involve other physiological correlates and corresponding mental \nphenomena . However, a s consciousness is dependent on  sentience , changes in the \npersonal ways of feelin g - the individual ’s ‘affective drive ’ – should have an impact on \npsychiatric disorders . For instance,  in anxiety disorders there is a phenomenon that may \nmetaphorically be conce ived of as a ‘shrinking ’ of the here-and-nowness , possibly \ncorresponding to a decreased capacity to  control  homeostasis.  In bipolar disorders, the \nmechanism of action of lithium  (which is, physically, a substitute for endogenous cations)  \nputatively impacts the physiological  correlates of sentience , facilitating  the induction of \nallostasis  by the astroglial calcium wave (Rivera and Butt, 2019) , thus reducing  the \nintensity of euphoric and depressive phases.  \n  According to  this perspective, disorders of mood and anxiety are primarily \ndisorders of sentience . The manifestation of ‘symptom s’ is shaped by the personal history  \nand cultural patterns , both of which influence how the ways of feeling are consolidated in \neach person and then operate unconsciously . As the  mechanisms of sentience  are not \nunder direct conscious cognitive control, the treatment of disorders requires the resources \nof physical (e.g. mag netic stimulation) and biological (e.g. pharmacological) therap ies, as \nwell as the resources of psychodynamics and behavioral training.   \n  Even though sentience (which is key to psychiatri c symptoms) is not under \nconscious control , it is impacted by  past conscious experiences related to, for instance, \nreligious faith  and socioeconomic hardship . It is primed by  psychosomatic,  religious, \nspiritual, economic and political experience  in complex  ways that can be approached in  \nseveral branches of Psychology , as the Jungian concept of a ‘collective unconscious’  \n(Hunt, 2012) . The influence of such priming  on the interplay of conscious emotions and \ncognition is central to all types of psychiatric dis orders.

These \naffective influences on cogniti on are claimed to  underpin  individual differences in visual \nand auditory process ing. Depending on the previous experience and the motivation  of \ndifferent people , the vertigo they experience during a roller -coaster ride may be strong or \npractically non-existent. \nThis proposed approach to psychiatric disorders contradicts current assumptions in  \nCognitive Neuroscience , for which the brain  correlates  of cogniti ve consciousness  \n(patterns of neuron connectivity and firing that instantiate  mental representations ) are \nconceived, for practical purposes, as independent from  the processes of sentience . \nCognitive representations are studied as the differential activation of  neuronal  circuits, or \nchanges in neuron synaptic connectivity above a given excitatory thresho ld, as detected \nby functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography  registers . This \ntype of data is often assumed to be sufficient  to explain  the neural correlates of  conscious \ncognition. The necessity of having a sentient being  experiencing t he representation for \nthe representation to be conscious is often neglected . \nContrasting with this assumption,  in the classical concept of ‘knowledge ’ \ncriticized by Plato , the existence of beliefs about the representation (and its linguistic \nexpression) is  considered a necessary component. The belief in a proposition is a sentien t \nmotivati on for  human linguistic b ehavior. Burton (2008) has argued , on an experimenta l \nbasis , that the “feeling of knowing” is the main psychological component of a person’s \nbelie f of knowing, even when what is believed is  false.  \nThe argument for the necessity of sentience  for cognitive representations  to \nbecome  conscious  can be formulated as follows. Any knowledge  acquisit ion is a triadic \nphenomenon, composed of:  \n1) A mental repre sentation, in the form of a statement, image or symbol;  \n2) The subject who experiences the representation  as a cognitive intentional object ; and  \n3) The referent, or the ‘real’ object the representation is about."

Higher -level capacities, such as imagining playing tennis (a technique for assessing \nresidual consciousness in vegetative states  – Owen  et al., 2006), may not be adequate as a \ngeneral standard  for medical  diagnosis of disorders of consciousness, since – according to the \nproposed reasoning – in many cases the person may not be able to perform well in  these tasks, \nbut still be  capabl e of consciously experiencing basic sensations  such as hunger, thirst and \npain,  in the presence of  the corresponding e ndogenous or exogenous  stimulation .

This possibility has important bio ethical \nimplications.  \nFocusing on sentience implies that there may  be biomarkers  useful for diagnosis , and \nnew ways of treating disorders of  sentience  (such as chronic pain) and emotional \nconsciousness ( such as depression and anxiety)  by means of electric and magnetic stimulation \naddressing the  glial network . Another possibility is the development of  new chemicals  to be  \ndelivered through the  glympathic system , address ing glia inste ad of neurons.  In sum, t he \ndevelopment of this field of  investigation in Neurology and Psychiatry can bring  new"
