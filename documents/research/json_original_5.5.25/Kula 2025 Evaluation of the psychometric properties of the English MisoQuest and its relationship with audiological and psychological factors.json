Validity was evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis, convergent, and discriminant validity. \nParticipants completed the English MisoQuest at two-time points and participated in follow-up interviews.\nStudy Sample: The study included 451 adult participants, with an average age of 36.4 years (SD 12.8).\nResults: The English MisoQuest showed very good internal consistency (k!and x0.93) and high test- \nretest reliability (ICC 0.89). While CFA indicated adequate overall model fit, it did not fully support a \none-factor structure, as some items shared variance even when controlled for the latent variable. \nConvergent validity was demonstrated by moderate to strong correlations with established misophonia \nquestionnaires. Weak correlations with non-misophonia measures supported discriminant validity. \nUnexpectedly, moderate correlations were found with Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire (r0.34; \npD0.01) and Three-dimensional Fatigue Inventory (r0.31; pD0.01).\nConclusion: The study found that the English version of MisoQuest is a reliable and valid tool for measur -\ning misophonia within the English-speaking adult population.ARTICLE HISTORY \nReceived 2 February 2024 \nRevised 30 December 2024 \nAccepted 10 January 2025 \nKEYWORDS \nMisophonia; Validity; \nReliability; English \nMisoQuest   \n1. Introduction\nMisophonia is characterised by profound emotional, physiological \nand behavioural reactions towards specific sounds or visual stim -\nuli, as defined by Swedo et al. (2022 ). Common triggers for miso -\nphonia involve sounds produced by others, particularly those \nlinked to oral functions (e.g. chewing, eating), nasal sounds (e.g. \nbreathing and sniffing) and repetitive sounds such as tapping or \nclicking. When individuals with misophonia are exposed to the \ntrigger sounds, they often experience emotional reactions (e.g. \nanger and irritation), bodily sensations (e.g. increased heart rate \nand tense muscles), and behavioural responses (e.g. avoidance and \naggressive behaviours, asking people to stop making the noise) \n(Dibb, Golding, and Dozier 2021 ; Edelstein et al. 2013 ; Jager, \nVulink, et al. 2020 ). The prevalence of clinical misophonia (i.e. \npeople for whom symptoms of misophonia cause a significant bur-\nden) has been reported in 18.4% of a representative sample of the \nUK adult population (Vitoratou et al. 2023 ). However, in the US, a \nrecent study by Dixon et al. (2024 ) found that 4.6% of the adult \npopulation experience clinical levels of misophonia.\nResearch indicates that misophonia is frequently associated \nwith conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and \ntrauma-related disorders (Schr oder, Vulink, and Denys 2013 ; Wu \net al. 2014 ). Approximately 28% of individuals diagnosed with \nmisophonia also exhibit one or more psychiatric disorders (Jager, \nVulink, et al. 2020 ). Misophonia co-occurs with a diverse range of anxiety disorders, with nearly 57% of sampled participants meet -\ning the criteria for at least one anxiety-related disorder (Rosenthal \net al. 2022 ). It is estimated that 12% of misophonia patients also \nexperience tinnitus, with 4% of them also presenting hyperacusis \n(Rouw and Erfanian 2018 ). Some studies have suggested that indi-\nviduals with misophonia also report hearing loss (Aazh et al. 2022 ; \nEnzler et al. 2021 ; Siepsiak et al. 2022 ). Dibb and Golding (2022 ) \nreported that individuals with misophonia have difficulties in \nemotional well-being and social functioning. They reported that \ncompared to quality of life, individuals with misophonia showed \nincreased levels of fatigue as measured by the Misophonia \nResponse scale (Dibb and Golding 2022 ).\nA valid and reliable measurement tool is essential for accurately \nassessing misophonia severity and ensuring consistent results \nacross studies, which enhances the credibility and comparability of \nresearch. The MisoQuest questionnaire, consisting of 14 items, \nwas initially validated in a Polish sample (Siepsiak et al. 2022 ). \nHowever, a recent systematic review by Kula, Cropley, and Aazh \n(2022 ) emphasised the need for further evaluation of MisoQuest’s \npsychometric properties, especially within an English-speaking \npopulation, using the COSMIN framework (Mokkink et al. 2018 ).\nThis study aims to validate the English version of the \nMisoQuest by evaluating its structural validity, reliability, meas -\nurement error, and convergent and discriminant validity accord -\ning to COSMIN standards (Mokkink et al. 2018 ). Our data \ncollection involved a three-stage approach.

      "text": "engaged in an online survey, completing the measurements at \ntwo separate points two weeks apart. A subsample of participants \nwho completed both stages of the survey were invited to the \nthird stage, which was an interview to complete the same survey, \nusing identical measures, but this time administered by the \nresearcher. More details are provided in the methods section.\nBased on existing research, we hypothesised the following for \nthe validation of the English MisoQuest. While Siepsiak et al. \n(2020 a) performed a confirmatory analysis using Graded Response \nModel to confirm the factor structure of the MisoQuest, they did \nnot use Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Although measure -\nment error was addressed in the original study, our study focuses \non analysing the standard error of measurement. Furthermore, \nboth convergent and discriminant validity are examined, aspects \nnot fully explored in the initial validation. We expected the \nEnglish version to demonstrate internal consistency (Cronbach’s k!\nand McDonald’s xF0.70), strong test-retest reliability similarly \nreliability levels as reported in the original scale’s development, \nand low measurement error. For convergent validity, we antici -\npated moderate to strong correlations between the English \nMisoQuest and other misophonia-related measures (e.g. AMISO- \nR, MIQ, SS4), and for discriminant validity, weak correlations \nwith constructs unrelated to misophonia, such as hearing loss, \nhyperacusis, mental health, sleep and stress.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Ethics approval and consent to participate\nEthics approval for the study was obtained from the University \nof Surrey Research Integrity and Governance Office (Reference: \nFHMS-21 22 083 EGA). All participants provided online consent \nafter being informed about the study’s objectives, procedures, \nand their right to withdraw at any time.\n2.2. Participants\nThe sample size was determined based on a 25:1 participant-to- \nitem ratio for the MisoQuest questionnaire, resulting in a min-\nimum target of 350 participants (Hair et al. 2019 ). Although \nsome scholars recommend a minimum ratio of 5:1 (Comrey and \nLee 2013 ), a larger sample size can improve factor stability and \nresult generalisability. For test-retest reliability, a minimum of \n100 participants were required to minimise statistical error and \nimprove reliability estimates (COSMIN guidelines; Mokkink \net al. (2018 ).\nThe survey link was distributed via university email lists, \nsocial media (Instagram, X), and the Hashir International \nSpecialist Clinics’ online newsletter. Additionally, it was shared \nwithin Facebook support groups and through non-profit organi -\nsations (e.g. SoQuiet). From 475 initial respondents, only those \nwho passed an attention check and met standard response time \ncriteria were included in the analysis, yielding a final sample of \n451. This quality control process aligns with recommendations \nto exclude careless responses (Arias et al. 2020 ; Chandler, Sisso, \nand Shapiro 2020 ), and we additionally excluded outliers with \nresponse times more than three standard deviations from the \nmean (Leys et al. 2013 ). Initially, 475 individuals were recruited \nfor the study. After applying the attention check and processing \ntime criteria, a final sample of 451 respondents was included in \nthe analysis. In the study’s second phase for test-retest reliability, \n154 participants took part.The inclusion criteria for participants included being at \nleast 18years old and having a good understanding of English \n(self-reported). Exclusion criteria were if they had a significant \ncognitive impairment or severe visual impairment (this was com -\nmunicated with them in the study invitation and information \nsheet).\n2.3. The translation process\nAccording our agreement with the developer of MisoQuest, we \nused the English version of MisoQuest that was translated from \nthe original Polish version and published as a supplement to \ntheir original paper (Siepsiak et al. 2022 ). For this translation, \ntwo Polish researchers translated the questionnaire from Polish \nto English. Following this, a third person, a native speaker famil -\niar with misophonia, corrected the translation for linguistic \naccuracy. They also approved that there was a back-translation \nof MisoQuest during the process.\n2.4. Procedures\nThe study, conducted between May and July 2023, invited partic -\nipants to complete an online survey on sound sensitivity, hosted \non Qualtrics (Provo, USA, https://www.qualtrics.com). After con-\nsenting and receiving study information, participants provided \ndemographic details (age, gender, education, ethnicity, religion, \nemployment and completed questionnaires assessing misophonia, \nhyperacusis, tinnitus, mental health, hearing, stress, sleep, and \nfatigue (see Section 2.5for details). Supplementary Figure 1 illus-\ntrates the stages of participant involvement. Although follow-up \ninterviews were planned after the test-retest phase, only 14 par-\nticipants agreed to participate.\n2.4.1. Test-retest reliability\nTo assess test-retest reliability, participants completed the survey \ntwice over a two-week interval, as recommended by Franzen \net al. (1987 ). A total of 154 participants engaged in this phase, \nproviding data on the stability of responses over time.\n2.4.2. Assessing the effect of administration mode \n(self-administered vs interview-based)\nFollowing the test-retest phase, participants were invited to an \noptional online interview to compare self-administered responses \nwith those gathered in a researcher-administered setting. \nFourteen participants took part in this third phase, which \noccurred immediately following the second phase. This allowed \nfor a comparison between self-administration and researcher- \nadministration of MisoQuest.\n2.4.3. Screening questions for tinnitus and hearing\nParticipants completed screening questions for tinnitus. Those \nwith tinnitus were asked to complete the Tinnitus Impact \nQuestionnaire (TIQ; Aazh et al. (2022a ). All participants \nanswered a hearing status question, and those indicating hearing \nloss completed the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI; Cassarly \net al. (2020 ).2\n F. B. KULA ET AL."

      "text": "2.5. Measures\nThe primary measure in this study was MisoQuest. Additional \nmeasures were administered to evaluate MisoQuest’s convergent \nand discriminant validity:\nMisoQuest (Siepsiak et al. 2020 a): This 14-item questionnaire \nuses a five-point Likert scale (1 “strongly disagree” to 5 \n\"strongly agree\") to evaluate sensitivity to bothersome sounds. \nOriginally developed in Polish, it demonstrated a Cronbach’s k!\nof 0.96 and ICC of 0.84 in reliability tests. The authors of \nMisoQuest (Siepsiak et al. 2020 a) acknowledged that they trans -\nlated the questionnaire into English, and we employed this \nEnglish version in our study. A cut-off value of 61 has been \nestablished to identify individuals who may be experiencing \nmisophonia by Siepsiak et al. (2020 ).\nThe Amsterdam Misophonia Scale- Revised (Jager, Vulink, \net al. 2020 ): A 10-item scale with a 0-4 rating for misophonia \nseverity, where scores of 0-10 indicate subclinical, 11-20 mild, \n21-30 moderate, and 31-40 severe symptoms. The English ver-\nsion of AMISO-R demonstrated a Cronbach’s k!of 0.81 (Naylor \net al. 2021 ) and was included to assess the convergent validity of \nMisoQuest.\nMisophonia Impact Questionnaire (Aazh, Najjari, et al. \n2024 ): An 8-item scale measuring the impact of misophonia, \nwith items 0-3 (00-1day, 12-6days, 27-10 days, 311- \n14days), with a total score range of 0-24. Scores �12 indicate \nsignificant impact (Erfanian and Aazh 2023 ). The MIQ demon -\nstrated strong reliability, with a Cronbach’s k!of 0.94 (Aazh, \nNajjari, et al. 2024 ). This measure was used to assess convergent \nvalidity.\nSound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (Aazh et al. \n2022b ): 5 item explores several sound sensitivity symptoms, \nincluding loudness hyperacusis, pain or discomfort hyperacusis, \nannoyance hyperacusis/misophonia, and fear hyperacusis, over \ntwo weeks. For each item, a score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 is assigned to \nthe response categories of 0 to 1day, 2 to 6days, 7 to 10days, \nand 11 to 14days, respectively. A score of five or more indicates \na clinically significant sound intolerance problem. In a clinical \nsample, the SSSQ demonstrated a reliability coefficient of \nCronbach’s k0.87 (Aazh et al. 2022b ). SS4 (item 4 in SSSQ) \nspecifically evaluates the severity of misophonia symptoms by \nassessing how often participants felt angry or anxious when \nexposed to specific sounds associated with eating noises, lip \nsmacking, sniffling, breathing, clicking sounds, and tapping over \nthe past two weeks. Consequently, we employed SS4 to measure \nconvergent validity. The sum of items 1, 2, 3, and 5 quantifies \nhyperacusis symptoms, and this part was used to assess discrim -\ninant validity.\nHyperacusis Impact Questionnaire (Aazh et al. 2022b ): An \n8-item tool assessing the hyperacusis impact with items scored 0- \n3 based on frequency (00-1day, 12-6days, 27-10 days, \n311-14 days), giving a total score range of 0-24. Scores of 12 \nor higher indicate a clinically significant impact. The HIQ \nshowed high reliability, with a Cronbach’s k!of 0.93 (Aazh et al. \n2022b ). This instrument was applied to assess discriminant \nvalidity.\nTinnitus Impact Questionnaire (Aazh et al. 2022a ): A 7-item \nmeasure assessing tinnitus impact daily activities, mood, and \nsleep. Each item is rated 0-3 to indicate frequency (00-1day, \n12-6days, 27-10 days, 311-14 days), yielding a total score \nrange of 0-21. Internal consistency is high, with Cronbach’s \nk0.89 (Aazh et al. 2022a ). Scores below 5 indicate no impact, \n5-6 mild impact, 7-8 moderate impact, and 9 or higher severe \nimpact. TIQ was used to assess discriminant validity.Screening for Anxiety & Depression in Tinnitus (Aazh et al. \n2023b ): The SAD-T contains four items that match those for the \nphysical health questionnaire (PHQ-4; Kroenke et al. 2009 ). Two \nitems relate to the experience of anxiety, and two relate to the \nexperience of depression. Each item is scored 0-3, corresponding \nto 0-1day, 2-6days, 7-10 days, and 11-14 days. The total score \nranges from 0 to 12, with scores of 4 or more indicating symp -\ntoms of anxiety and/or depression. The SAD-T has high reliabil -\nity (Cronbach’s k0.91; Aazh et al. (2023b ) and was used to \nassess discriminant validity.\nHearing Handicap Inventory (Cassarly et al. 2020 ): A 10- \nitem measure assessing the social and emotional impact of hear -\ning loss. Responses are scored as “yes” (4), “sometimes” (2), or \n“no” (0), with total scores ranging from 0 to 40. Score ranges: 0- \n8 (no handicap), 10-24 (mild-moderate), 26-40 (severe). Higher \nscores indicate greater perceived handicap. The HHI shows high \ninternal consistency (Cronbach’s k0.95; Cassarly et al. (2020 ) \nand was used to assess discriminant validity.\nA single-item measure of stress symptoms (Elo, Leppanen, \nand Jahkola 2003 ): A one-item questionnaire assesses the stress \nsymptoms. The scores range from 1-5. Higher scores showed \ngreater stress levels. The single-item measure has been found \nvalid in terms of content and criterion validity by Elo, Leppanen, \nand Jahkola (2003 ). We used this questionnaire to examine the \ndiscriminant validity because it assesses stress symptoms.\nSingle Item Sleep Quality Scale (Snyder et al. 2018 ): One \nitem measure that evaluates sleep quality. The scores “0”: \nTerrible, “1-3”: Poor, “4-6”: Fair, “7-9 “: Good, “10”: Excellent. \nThe test-retest reliability of this measure was found to be 0.74 in \nstable patients with depression and 0.62 in insomnia patients \nduring a 4-week period, and it demonstrated good convergent \nand discriminant validity. We used this item to assess the dis-\ncriminant validity due to its focus on measuring sleep quality.\nThree-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (Frone and Tidwell \n2015 ): The 3D-WFI is an 18-item tool assessing fatigue across \nthree dimensions: physical, mental, and emotional (six items \neach). Responses are on a five-point Likert scale (1every day \nto 5never). Internal consistency for each dimension is high, \nwith reliability estimates exceeding 0.90 (Frone, Reis, and \nOttenstein 2018 ). The 3D-WFI was used to assess the discrimin -\nant validity of the English version of MisoQuest.\n2.6. Data analysis\nDescriptive statistics and normality tests, including the \nKolmogorov-Smirnov test, were calculated for all administered \nmeasures. Normality was assessed visually through histograms \nand quantitatively to ensure data met parametric assumptions. \nAll analyses, except CFA, were conducted in IBM SPSS version \n28.0. The structural validity of the English MisoQuest was \nassessed by CFA using IBM SPSS Amos version 28, following \ninitial analysis in AMOS, a re-assessment was conducted in R \nusing “lavaan” package with the Weighted Least Squares Mean \nand Variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator to account for the \nordinal nature of the data. Model fit was evaluated using Root \nMeans Square of Approximation (RMSEA), Standardised Root \nMean Square Residual (SRMR), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), \nComparative Fit Index (CFI), Goodness of fit indexes (GFI), \nCMIN (Chi-square/df). Following Schermelleh-Engel, \nMoosbrugger, and Muller (2003 ), a good model fit was defined \nby SRMR �0.05; RMSEA �0.05, TLI �0.97, CFI �0.97, GFI \n�0.95 and v2/df �2.INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY\n 3"

      "text": "Reliability analyses included internal consistency (Cronbach’s \nk!and McDonald’s x), test-retest reliability, and measurement \nerror. Internal consistency was considered acceptable with k!or \nx!values F0.7 (Hayes and Coutts 2020 ). Cronbach’s k!and \nMcDonald’s x�have a value between 0 and 1, where a value \ngreater than 0.7 is considered acceptable (Raykov and \nMarcoulides 2011 ). Confidence intervals (CIs) for Cronbach’s k!\nwere determined using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCA) \nbootstrap with 1,000 bootstrap samples. To provide a compre -\nhensive understanding of MisoQuest’s reliability, we also \nreported model-based measurement error, such as item reliability \nwithin the measurement model, which offers additional informa -\ntion beyond what is provided by Cronbach’s k!and \nMcDonald’s x.\nTest-retest reliability over a two-week interval was assessed by \nintra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), using a two-way mixed \nmodel with absolute agreement, with ICC F0.75 indicating \ngood reliability (Fapta and Ms 2015 ). Measurement error was \nfurther analysed using the standard error of measurement \n(SEM), the minimal detectable change (MDC 95), and Bland- \nAltman analyses. The SEM assesses the variability within subjects \nwhen measuring them repeatedly as a group (Haley and Fragala- \nPinkham 2006 ). The MDC 95 represents the smallest detectable \nchange exceeding measurement error, indicating a significant \nchange with 95% confidence (Schuck and Zwingmann 2003 ). \nBland-Altman analyses were used to identify systematic bias \nbetween repeated measurements. The Bland-Altman plot shows \nagreement between two test occasions and highlights potential \noutliers. If the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean differ -\nence includes zero, it suggests no significant systematic bias. The \n95% limit of agreement (LOA) was used to examine natural vari-\nation, with narrower LOA indicating greater stability (Bland and \nAltman 1986 ).\nConvergent validity of the English MisoQuest was assessed by \nPearson correlation coefficients between MisoQuest scores and \nother misophonia measures (AMISOS-R, MIQ, SS4). \nDiscriminate validity was examined by correlating MisoQuest \nscores with measures unrelated to misophonia (HIQ, SSSQ \nexcluding item 4, SAD-T, TIQ, sleep and stress measures, 3D- \nWFI, HHI). Correlation strength was categorised as strong \n(F0.5), moderate (0.30–0.49), or weak (0.10–0.29) (Cohen 1992 ). \nModerate to strong positive correlations supported convergent \nvalidity, while weak correlations supported discriminant validity.\nFinally, a paired t-test was used to compare MisoQuest scores \nbetween self- and researcher-administered conditions in the third \nstage, assessing the effect of administration mode.\n3. Results\n3.1. Participants’ characteristics and descriptive statistics\nDemographic data of the 451 respondents who completed the \nsurvey are provided in the Supplementary Table 1. Most partici -\npants identified as female (N272, 60.3%), white (N346, \n76.7), married (N243, 53.9%), employed full-time (N235, \n52.1%), not having any religion (N184, 40.8%), having a bach -\nelor’s degree (N165, 36.6%). The average age of the sample \nwas 36.46 years (SD12.81).\nParticipants were recruited from the general population, stu-\ndent groups, and support communities for hyperacusis, misopho -\nnia, and tinnitus. For detailed descriptive statistics and findings \nfor each questionnaire and item in the English version of the \nMisoQuest, please refer to Table 1and 2.The study included 451 participants across various groups: \n“General” (205), “Student” (109), “SoQuiet (misophonia charity)” \n(61), and “Other Support Groups” (76, including social media, \ntinnitus patients, and a tinnitus charity).\n3.2. Prevalence of misophonia, tinnitus, hyperacusis, hearing \nloss, sleep disturbance, and mental health symptoms among \nall respondents\nApproximately 21.7% of respondents (98/451) were identified as \nhaving misophonia based on the MisoQuest, with a higher \nprevalence in females (60/98). A Chi-Square test showed a sig-\nnificant difference in misophonia prevalence between females \nand males (v2 (1) 16.52, p D.001). Among those with miso -\nphonia, 32.1% reported tinnitus, and 16.7% reported hearing \nloss. Misophonia prevalence also varied by employment status: \n10% among students, 18% among employed individuals, and 5% \namong retired individuals, with a significant association found \n(v2 (2) 19.48, p D.005). Regarding tinnitus, 39% of partici -\npants reported experiencing it, with varying levels of impact \n(9.3% mild, 12.1% moderate, 42.2% severe). Hyperacusis had a \nclinically significant impact on 35.5% of participants, while 20% \nreported hearing loss, with 44% experiencing bilateral loss. Sleep \ndisturbance varied, with 18% reporting poor sleep and 34.1% \nreporting good sleep quality. This sleep-specific questionnaire is \nseparate from the tinnitus measure and assesses sleep quality in \ngeneral, regardless of tinnitus. Additionally, 61% of participants \nshowed possible symptoms of anxiety and/or depression based \non SAD-T. Misophonia prevalence varied by the questionnaire \nused: 21.7% with MisoQuest, 36.6% with MIQ, and 80% with \nAMISOS-R, which also categorised symptoms as 34.1% mild, \n35.5% moderate, and 10.2% severe to extreme.\n3.3. Structural validity\nThe initial CFA model, based on Siepsiak et al. (2020 a), was \ntested on the present dataset to confirm the one-factor structure \nof 14 items. Model fit was poor: v2 295.73, v2/df 3.84 \n(above the recommended threshold of 2), RMSEA 0.07 \n(exceeding the 0.05 limit), CFI 0.94, and TLI 0.93 (both \nbelow the 0.97 cut-off), though SRMR was acceptable at 0.04. \nModification indices were then used to address misspecifications, \nresulting in improved fit indices: v2 180.53, df 72, v2/df \n2.50, RMSEA 0.05, SRMR 0.03, CFI 0.97, and TLI \n0.96 (Please see Supplementary Figure 2). In a subsequent ana-\nlysis, the model fit was reassessed using the WLSMV estimator \nto better align with the ordinal nature of the data, yielding \nslightly better fit indices compared to the modified model: v2/df \n2.41, SRMR 0.04, RMSEA 0.05, CFI 0.97, TLI 0.97.\n3.4. Reliability and measurement error\nCronbach’s k!and McDonald’s x!for the English version of the \nMisoQuest were both robust, each with a value of 0.93 in this \nsample. Factor loadings for each item were analysed to assess \ntheir relationship with the underlying latent construct. These \nloadings, along with the corresponding item reliability (R2) val-\nues, are presented in Table 2. The factor loadings, ranging from \n0.62 to 0.76, are considered moderate to very good, indicating \nthat the items effectively represent the intended construct. The \nR2 values, which range from 0.38 to 0.58, suggest moderate to \ngood reliability, confirming that a significant portion of the 4\n F. B. KULA ET AL."

The SEM \nwas 3.19, indicating the standard deviation of an observed score \naround the true score, and the MDC 95 was 8.81, reflecting the \nminimum detectable change. Bland-Altman analysis revealed no \nsignificant systematic bias, with the mean difference close to \nzero.

The paired t-test \nanalysis indicated no statistically significant difference between \nthe two methods, as the mean difference was −2.43 (95% CI \n[-5.3, 0.49]), t (12) −1.7, p0.97. The effect size, Cohen’s d, \nwas estimated at −0.44, with a 95% confidence interval \nranging from −0.95 to 0.08. In addition, a correlation analysis \nrevealed a strong positive correlation between the scores of par-\nticipant-administered and researcher-administered MisoQuest, \nwith a correlation coefficient of 0.91 (pD0.01). This suggests a \nhigh degree of agreement between the two methods of delivery. \nThese results indicate that when participants completed the ques -\ntionnaire alone, it did not significantly impact the scores, and \nthe two methods demonstrated a strong correlation.\n4. Discussion\nThe study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the \nEnglish MisoQuest following COSMIN guidelines (Mokkink \net al. 2018 ) for translated questionnaire. CFA initially indicated a \none-factor structure consistent with the model proposed by \nSiepsiak et al. (2020 a). However, the initial model fit was poor, \nso modifications were made to improve model fit. These changes \naddressed shared variance among items with similar emotional \nand behavioural responses to trigger sounds, improved the over -\nall model fit. Nonetheless, since these adjustments were data- \ndriven rather than theory-based, they might suggest potential \nmultidimensionality within the measure. Subsequent reassess -\nment using the WLSMV estimator, which accounts for the \nordinal nature of the data, yielded improved yet still adequate fit \ncompared to the modified ML model, with persistent evidence of \nmultidimensionality. Persistent evidence of multidimensionality \nsuggests that future studies should further refine the model to \nalign it more closely with theoretical frameworks.\nThe internal consistency of the English version of MisoQuest \nwith Cronbach’s k!and McDonald’s x!of 0.93, closely aligns with \nthe original scale developer’s reported Cronbach’s k!of 0.96 by \nSiepsiak et al. (2020 a), highlighting the robustness of the ques -\ntionnaire’s reliability across different sample characteristics. Our \nstudy found a test-retest reliability ICC value of 0.89 for the \nEnglish version of MisoQuest, slightly higher than the original \ndeveloper’s reported value of 0.84, indicating strong consistency \nin responses over a two-week period.\nWhile Siepsiak et al. (2020 a) addressed measurement error in \nthe original Polish version of MisoQuest, and Raymond and \nButler (2024 ) have previously examined convergent and discrim -\ninant validity in the English version, our study provides a com -\nprehensive psychometric analysis following COSMIN standards. \nThis approach offers a robust evaluation of the English \nMisoQuest, supporting its suitability for clinical and research \napplications.\nOur examination of convergent validity showed moderate to \nstrong correlations between MisoQuest scores and those from \nAMISOS-R, MIQ, and SS4, indicating that these instruments \nassess related constructs. However, discrepancies were observed \nin the proportion of participants diagnosed with misophonia \nacross these tools, which relates to diagnostic or differential val-\nidity rather than convergent validity. Specifically, AMISOS-R \nidentified a higher prevalence than both MisoQuest and MIQ, \nlikely due to differences in design and conceptual frameworks. \nEach tool approaches misophonia measurement uniquely: \nAMISOS-R focuses on experiences triggered in the past three \ndays, MisoQuest has no specified timeframe, and MIQ assesses \nthe impact of misophonia on patients’ lives over a two-week period. Therefore, these differences reflect the diverse approaches \nused in each questionnaire. Future studies should explore \nwhether a distinction between misophonia as a trait or a disorder \ncan be made using MisoQuest and AMISOS-R and how these \nmight be related to the impact of misophonia on the patient’s \nlife measured via MIQ.\nThe English version of MisoQuest demonstrates reasonably \ngood discriminant validity, as evidenced by its weak correlations \nwith tinnitus impact, hearing loss, sleep, stress, depression, and \nanxiety. However, there was a moderate correlation between \nMisoQuest and HIQ that assesses hyperacusis. This means that \nMisoQuest may be influenced by hyperacusis symptoms. \nHyperacusis is different to misophonia and is characterised by \nthe perception of certain everyday sounds, such as domestic \nnoise or noise in public places, as too loud or painful (Aazh \net al. 2014 ). One explanation is that HIQ may be influenced by \nmisophonia in addition to hyperacusis. However, this is unlikely \nas Aazh, Najjari, et al. (2024 ) reported that the mean of HIQ \nscore among patients with misophonia was 8.8 (SD 8.2) com -\npared with 18.5 (SD 6.9) among patients with hyperacusis. \nThis indicates that HIQ is reasonably specific in differentiating \nthe impact of hyperacusis from misophonia. Another explanation \nfor the moderate relationship observed between MisoQuest and \nHIQ is a possible overlap between misophonia and one form of \nhyperacusis (i.e. annoyance hyperacusis). According to Tyler \net al. (2014 ) hyperacusis has four subtypes: loudness hyperacusis, \npain hyperacusis, annoyance hyperacusis, and fear hyperacusis. \nPrevious studies also suggest possible relationship or comorbidity \nbetween hyperacusis and misophonia (Aazh et al. 2022 ; Aazh, \nNajjari, et al. 2024 ).\nThe English version of MisoQuest indicated a moderated cor-\nrelation with fatigue measure (3D-WFI). This result is consistent \nwith findings from Dibb and Golding (2022 ), who also reported \na moderate correlation between misophonia and fatigue. There is \na need for future studies to further explore the relationships \nbetween misophonia, hyperacusis and fatigue.\nNo significant correlation was found between hearing loss \nand misophonia, consistent with previous studies (Aazh et al. \n2022 ; Siepsiak et al. 2022 ). In terms of mental health, we \nobserved a weak correlation between misophonia and anxiety- \ndepression, differing from the moderate correlation reported by \nWu et al. (2014 ), likely due to sample differences, as their study \nfocused on students while ours involved a more diverse popula -\ntion. Similarly, we found a weak correlation between misophonia \nand stress, which contrasts with the moderate correlation \nreported by McKay et al. (2018 ). This discrepancy may be due to \ndifferences in participant demographics and the use of different \nquestionnaires, as their study focused on U.S. participants and \nused the Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al. 2014 ) and \nDepression Anxiety Stress Scale (Lovibond and Lovibond 1995 ). \nThese findings underscore the need for future studies to further \ninvestigate the relationship between misophonia and mental \nhealth and stress, particularly using validated tools such as \nMisoQuest.\nAdditionally, we found a weak but significant negative correl -\nation between MisoQuest scores and sleep quality, indicating \nthat higher misophonia symptoms are associated with poorer \nsleep. Although no prior studies have explored this relationship, \nresearch on hyperacusis has shown a connection between sound \nsensitivity and sleep problems, with 30% of participants reporting \nsleep issues (Fioretti, Fusetti, and Eibenstein 2013 ). Further \nresearch should explore the impact of misophonia on sleep qual -\nity to expand our understanding of this relationship.6\n F. B. KULA ET AL."

      "text": "Some limitations should be considered when interpreting the \noutcomes of this study. First, female and male participant num -\nbers in our study were unequal. This imbalance, however, is con-\nsistent findings from other online misophonia studies (Dibb, \nGolding, and Dozier 2021 ), which also observed a higher propor -\ntion of female participants. In addition, Siepsiak et al. (2020 a) \nwho investigated the invariance based on gender, found that \nwomen demonstrated higher misophonia symptoms compared to \nmen. However, it is important to note that in studies with repre -\nsentative samples of the population, there is no clear evidence \nthat females score higher than males. Therefore, conclusions \nfrom convenience samples like ours should not be generalised to \nthe whole population.\nSingle-item measures offer simplicity but also come with limi-\ntations. While test-retest reliability can be evaluated, internal \nconsistency cannot be measured, as there is only one item. This \nlimitation is especially important in cross-sectional studies like \nours, where comprehensive reliability assessment is critical. For \nsingle-item measures, certain reliability aspects remain uncertain, \nso the findings should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, \nsingle-item measures may be effective for straightforward con-\nstructs (e.g. sleep quality), but as noted by Elo, Leppanen, and \nJahkola (2003 ), may not fully capture more complex, multidi -\nmensional constructs such as stress.\nLastly, we did not measure responsiveness to change for \nMisoQuest, which refers to ability to detect changes over time in \nthe construct (Mokkink et al. 2018 ). Therefore, further research \nis needed to measure changes in MisoQuest scores before and \nafter any intervention.\n5. Conclusions\nThe English MisoQuest is a reliable and valid tool for assessing \nmisophonia in English-speaking populations for both research \nand clinical use. High reliability was indicated by Cronbach’s k!\nand McDonald’s x!values of 0.93. CFA results demonstrated \nadequate overall model fit but did not fully support a one-factor \nstructure, as some items shared variance beyond what was \nexplained by the latent variable, suggesting potential multidimen -\nsionality within the measure. Test-retest reliability was strong, \nwith an ICC of 0.89, factor loadings between 0.62 and 0.76, and \nitem reliability (R2) values from 0.38 to 0.58. Convergent validity \nwas shown through moderate to strong correlations with related \nmeasures (AMISOS-R, MIQ), while discriminant validity was \nsupported by weak correlations with distinct constructs (TIQ, \nHHI, sleep, stress, and SAD-T). One limitation is the moderate \ncorrelation with HIQ, a hyperacusis measure, suggesting a need \nfor future studies to further explore the relationship between \nmisophonia and hyperacusis and to refine psychometric tools for \ntheir differentiation.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was part of the first author’s PhD thesis at University of \nSurrey which is funded by the Ministry of National Education of the \nRepublic of Turkey for supporting her graduate education.
