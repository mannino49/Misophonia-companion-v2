Conversely, \npositive soundscapes can have a beneficial impact on health by alleviating stress \nand fatigue, promoting psychological recovery. To assess the restorative potential \nof soundscapes, various scales have been developed to create environments \nconducive to recovery. However, current research on perceptual restorativeness \nsoundscape scales primarily focuses on adults, lacking a dedicated scale for \nchildren to evaluate the restorative potential of their surrounding acoustic \nenvironments from their perspective.\nMethods:  Therefore, this study introduces the development and validation \nprocess of the Perceived Restorativeness of Soundscapes Scale for Children \n(PRSS-C) using survey questionnaires and data statistical analysis.\nResults:  The study comprises two experiments. Experiment one aims to develop \nan effective PRSS-C, evaluating the restorative potential of soundscapes in \ndifferent environments (urban center, urban suburb, and urban peripheral forest) \namong 185 children aged 10-12. Through a series of analyses, a dual-factor \nstructure scale consisting of 15 items is developed, revealing that the restorative \npotential of soundscapes is lower in urban centers than in urban suburbs and \nlower in urban suburbs than in urban peripheral forests. Experiment two aims \nto further validate the effectiveness of PRSS-C. 244 children aged 10-12 assess \nthe restorative potential of soundscapes in similar environments (two city parks) \nusing the PRSS-C developed in experiment one. Factor analysis confirms the \ndual-factor structure, with assessment results indicating that the restorative \npotential of soundscapes in Temple of Heaven Park is lower than in the National \nBotanical Garden. This suggests that PRSS-C enables children to differentiate \nthe restorative potential of soundscapes in similar environments within the \nsame city, further confirming its effectiveness.\nDiscussion:  This study successfully develops and validates the PRSS-C through \ntwo experiments. The use of this scale allows for the assessment of the \nrestorative potential of acoustic environments surrounding children, providing \nan effective tool for evaluating and creating positive soundscapes for children.\nKEYWORDS\nchildren, restorative environment, soundscape, scale, assessment, development, \nvalidationOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY\nFrancesco Aletta,  \nUniversity College London, United Kingdom\nREVIEWED BY\nSarah R.

      "text": "Qin et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362096\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org1 Introduction\nNoise severely affects the physical and mental health of \nindividuals. Prolonged exposure to noisy environments can cause \nserious damage to the auditory system ( Prell et al., 2012 ), nervous \nsystem ( Kabuto et al., 1993 ), cardiovascular system, and more ( Nawaz \nand Hasnain, 2010 ). It may even lead to adverse psychological \nreactions such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders ( Zhu and \nJones, 2010 ; Lai et al., 2014 ). To address this issue, numerous measures \nhave been established to assess people’s negative perceptions of sound \n(Berglund et al., 2000 ; Stansfeld et al., 2005 ; Maynard et al., 2009 ), \nincluding noise interference models ( Botteldooren et al., 2003 ) and \nnoise disturbance surveys ( Fields et al., 2001 ). However, as an integral \npart of daily life, the acoustic environment has garnered increasing \nattention for its positive impacts on health ( Aletta et al., 2018 ; Hong \net al., 2019 ; Aletta et al., 2023 ). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, \nCanadian composer and scientist Professor Schafer (Schafer, R.M.) \nintroduced the concept of “soundscape” ( Schafer, 1969 ). In the same \nyear, Southworth (1969)  also mentioned the concept of soundscape in \nhis paper The Sonic Environment of Cities . Unlike traditional noise \ncontrol, soundscapes prioritize perception over mere physical \nquantities. They consider positively impactful sounds rather than just \nnon-noise ( Kang, 2014 ). Creating a positive acoustic environment for \nresidents not only alleviates stress and fatigue but also promotes \ncommunication and interaction among people ( Kang et al., 2016 ).\nTo evaluate people’s positive perceptions of sound, various \nsoundscape indicators have been established worldwide as evaluation \nstandards. Current soundscape assessments primarily rely on \nsociological and psychological methods. For instance, Raimbault et al. \n(2003)  observed behaviors and conducted surveys to derive a \nsoundscape element evaluation method, revealing a correlation \nbetween people’s perception of spatial size and acoustic indicators. \nPheasant et al. (2008)  proposed a method to evaluate “tranquility” \nusing a ratio function of noise levels and natural elements in the \nenvironment through questionnaire surveys. Torija et  al. (2014)  \ndeveloped a city soundscape assessment tool using support vector \nmachine algorithms, enabling the evaluation of people’s acoustic \nperception and monitoring acoustic characteristics at selected \nlocations. The UK researcher Payne (2013)  first developed a Perceived \nRestorativeness Soundscape Scale (PRSS) for adults, assessing the \nrestorative potential of surrounding acoustic environments. The \nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) ( International \nStandardization Organization, 2018 ) standardized soundscape \nassessment methods, including soundwalks, questionnaire surveys, \nand guided interviews.\nThe aforementioned studies mainly focused on adults. However, \ndue to children being in a special stage of physical and psychological \ndevelopment, the impact of the soundscape on children differs \nsignificantly from that on adults ( Spivak and Chute, 1994 ). As a result, \nresearchers have begun to pay attention to the positive effects of sound \non children’s health. For example, British researchers like Lubman \n(2002)  found that the sounds in classrooms and play areas affect \nchildren’s behavior and learning. They suggested using outdoor \nnatural sounds to promote children’s learning, which is beneficial for \ntheir communication and interaction. Chinese researchers like Ma \net  al. (2022)  discovered that the pleasantness and tranquility of \nsoundscapes significantly influence children’s evaluations of \nsoundscapes, demonstrating that soundscape quality significantly affects children’s cognitive development. Visentin et al. (2023)  found \nthrough their research on indoor soundscapes in elementary schools \nthat the pleasantness of soundscapes is related to students’ age, \nperceived sound loudness, and the frequency of sounds from nearby \nclassrooms. The study results also showed that most school-aged \nchildren are exposed to unpleasant sounds and they prefer music and \nnatural sounds.\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of researchers have begun to \nfocus on the psychological recovery effects of soundscapes on \nchildren. For instance, Shu and Ma (2018)  created a PRSS-C Scale, \nconsisting of 16 items that divide children’s perception of soundscape \nrestorativeness into three dimensions. Through their research, they \nfound that children’s perception of the restorativeness of acoustic \nenvironments is positively correlated with fluctuation intensity and \nsharpness, and negatively correlated with loudness and roughness. \nSubsequently, the team ( Shu and Ma, 2019 ) discovered that music, \nbird sounds, fountain sounds, and stream sounds can significantly \nalleviate children’s psychological stress, improve their attention \nrestoration performance. The team ( Shu, 2023 ) further demonstrated \nthat music, bird sounds, and fountain sounds have potential restorative \neffects on children, with music being the most restorative sound.\nHowever, the scale created by Shu and Ma (2018)  needs further \ndevelopment and validation. Firstly, in terms of sample size, the \nsample size chosen by Ma et al. for creating PRSS-C was relatively \nsmall (only 36 students). Although there is no minimum sample size \nrequirement for statistical purposes in developing scales, a sufficiently \nlarge sample size is needed to focus attention on the appropriateness \nof items ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ). Secondly, in the process of data \nstatistical analysis, an effective scale should include a complete process \nof development and validation. The purpose of the development \nprocess is to analyze the initial sample, calculate the internal \nconsistency of the scale, evaluate scale items, and adjust the number \nof scale items. The validation process is to cross-validate the initial \nanalysis results and test whether the data analysis results of the \ndevelopment process can be reproduced ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ). \nTherefore, addressing the aforementioned issues, this study, based on \nthe results of Ma et  al. ’s research, referred to some items in the \nPerceived Restorative Components Scale for Children (PRCS-C) \n(Bagot, 2004 ) and the PRSS for adults ( Payne, 2013 ), further developed \nand validated the effectiveness of the PRSS-C, providing an effective \nassessment tool for children’s perceived restorative soundscapes.\nSince the 20th century, “restorative environments” have gradually \nbecome a research hotspot in various fields, attracting widespread \nattention from disciplines such as environmental psychology, public \nhealth, and urban planning ( Hartig and Staats, 2003 ; Su and Ziqiang, \n2010 ). There are two main theoretical frameworks: the Attention \nRestoration Theory (ART) proposed by Kaplan and Kaplan (1989)  in \nthe field of environmental psychology, and the Stress Reduction \nTheory (SRT) put forth by Ulrich in the field of restorative architecture \n(Ulrich et al., 1991 ). Building on these theories, research on restorative \nenvironments has made significant progress, with numerous studies \nconfirming that natural environments have greater restorative \nqualities compared to urban environments ( Karmanov and Hamel, \n2008 ; Gidlow et al., 2016 ; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016 ).\nPsychological recovery involves bouncing back from attention \nfatigue and everyday work stress ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ; Herzog \net  al., 1997 ). It has been shown that psychological recovery can \nenhance people’s attention performance ( Tennessen and Cimprich,"

The Attention Restoration Theory ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ; \nKaplan, 1995 ) outlines four components that should be present in a \nrestorative environment: Fascination, Being-Away, Compatibility, and \nExtent (collectively referred to as FACE in this paper). In a given \nenvironment, the presence or absence of these four components \ndetermines its restorative nature. Overall, a highly restorative \nenvironment should encompass each component of FACE; otherwise, \nthe restorative potential of that environment may be  diminished. \nFascination is the most crucial feature of a restorative environment, \nsignifying that when environmental elements are highly interesting, \ninvoluntary attention plays a primary role. Individuals no longer need \nto actively focus their attention, and the effort to suppress distractions \ncan relax, thus allowing directed attention to recover and reducing \nattention fatigue ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ). Being-Away refers to \ndistancing individuals from mentally taxing cognitive activities that \nrequire directed attention, facilitating the recovery of fatigued \nattention. This component is further divided into two types of \n“away”—physical away, referring to different geographical locations, \nand psychological away, involving a shift in thoughts ( Kaplan and \nKaplan, 1989 ). Compatibility indicates that the environment aligns \nwith people’s purposes or interests ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ). High \nalignment between individual interests and the environment reduces \nthe use of directed attention, thereby decreasing fatigue associated \nwith directed attention. Extent refers to the capacity of the restorative \nenvironment to offer sufficient content and information. It must \npossess coherence and richness, encouraging people to observe, \nexperience, or contemplate, thus occupying their minds to a certain \nextent and placing them in a completely different psychological state, \nallowing overworked attention to rest ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ).\nThe magnitude of environmental restorativeness depends on an \nindividual’s perception of FACE in that environment. Consequently, \nvarious scales have been developed to assess individuals’ perception \nof FACE in different environments, helping to determine the \nrestorative potential of those environments ( Hartig et  al., 1997 ; \nLaumann et al., 2001 ; Herzog et al., 2003 ). Additionally, the PRCS-C \nhas been developed ( Bagot, 2004 ) to compare children’s perception of \nenvironmental restorativeness with that of adults. However, a positive \nimpact on health can also result from a favorable acoustic \nenvironment. Research on restorative soundscapes, grounded in the \nAttention Restoration Theory, explores how pleasant sounds \ncontribute to psychological recovery. To this end, Payne (2013)  \ndeveloped the PRSS in 2013, aiming to assess people’s perception of \nthe FACE components in acoustic environment environments and, \nconsequently, evaluating the restorative potential of acoustic  \nenvironments.\nIn summary, the current research on restorative soundscapes \npredominantly focuses on adults. However, with the emergence of \nrestorative environments, an increasing number of researchers are \nexploring the psychological recovery effects of soundscapes on \nchildren. Many studies have already demonstrated that favorable \nsoundscapes can significantly promote psychological recovery in \nchildren. For this reason, Ma et al. created the PRSS-C ( Shu and Ma, \n2018 ), which allows children to assess the restorative quality of the \nsurrounding acoustic environment. However, further development \nand validation of the PRSS-C are needed. Therefore, this study \nemployed scale assessment and statistical data analysis methods to \nconduct two experiments, ultimately developing and validating the \nPRSS-C effectiveness. This scale was designed and adapted based on the general PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ) and the PRSS-C created by Shu and \nMa (2018)  while also referencing the development and testing process \nof the PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ). Unlike the PRCS-C, the PRSS-C mainly \nfocuses on the impact of sound on children rather than the general \nenvironment. Additionally, unlike the PRSS, the research subjects of \nthe PRSS-C are children, focusing on children’s perception of \nrestorative soundscapes rather than adults. The first study was \nconducted under semi-controlled conditions to initially analyze the \nsamples and test the ability of the PRSS-C to distinguish the restorative \nnature of soundscapes in three different types of environments (urban \ncenter, urban suburb, and urban peripheral forest). The second study, \nalso conducted under semi-controlled conditions, aimed to cross-\nvalidate the initial analysis results by testing the PRSS-C’s ability to \ndistinguish the restorative nature of soundscapes from two similar \nenvironments (two city parks) within the same city. Specifically, the \nultimate goal of these two experiments was to develop and validate the \neffectiveness of the PRSS-C, providing an effective assessment tool for \nevaluating the restorative potential of acoustic environments \nsurrounding children.\n2 Establishment of PRSS-C\nThe main purpose of this study is to develop and validate the \neffectiveness of PRSS-C. To do so, we first need to create a PRSS-C. The \ndesign of items in the scale includes designing and adapting some \nitems from PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ), and referencing the creation of \nsome items in PRSS-C by Shu and Ma (2018) . Additionally, based on \nthe opinions of scale compilation experts, some items from the PRSS \nwere also referenced ( Payne, 2013 ). The adaptation method follows \nthe adaptation method of PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ), and the initial PRSS-C \nwas created according to the scale compilation guidelines in “Scale \nDevelopment: Theory and Applications” ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ).\nTo ensure the validity of each item in PRSS-C as much as possible \nduring the initial creation stage, further analysis of the composition \ncharacteristics of the three referenced scales is needed. Firstly, \nKathleen L. Bagot developed PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ) in 2004 and \nfurther developed PRSS-C II ( Bagot, 2007 ) in 2007. The scale consists \nof 15 items forming a five-level speech scale, dividing children’s \nperceptual recovery of the general environment into five dimensions: \nFascination, Being-Away-ph, Compatibility, Being-Away-ps, and \nExtent. The cumulative percentage of variance of the five factors is \n60.75%. The scale is mainly used to assess the restorative potential of \nthe general environment for children. However, this study mainly \nfocuses on the restorative potential of acoustic environments for \nchildren. Therefore, the descriptions related to the general \nenvironment were modified to be related to sound, and the adaptation \nof each item was validated using statistical analysis.\nSecondly, Payne (2013)  developed and validated the PRSS for \nadults in 2013. The development and validation process of this scale \nreferred to the development and validation process of the Perceived \nRestorativeness Scale (PRS) for adults by Laumann et al. (2001) . The \nscale consists of 14 items forming a seven-level speech scale, dividing \nadults’ perception of acoustic environments into two dimensions: \ngeneral dimension and Being-Away-Extent dimension. The \ncumulative variance percentage of the two factors is between 36 and \n45%. The scale is mainly used to assess the restorative potential of \nsoundscapes for adults. However, this study focuses on school-aged"

Based on the opinions of different elementary school \neducators and relevant scale compilation experts, the descriptions \nrelated to the acoustic environment for adults were modified to \nbe understandable to children.\nFinally, Shu and Ma (2018)  created a PRSS-C in 2018. The scale \nconsists of 16 items forming a five-level speech scale, dividing \nchildren’s perception of acoustic environments into three dimensions: \nFascination, Compatibility, and Extent. The cumulative percentage of \nvariance for Fascination is 40.06%, for Compatibility is 20.41%, and \nfor Extent is 11.75%. The overall cumulative variance percentage is \nrelatively high (72.21%), and the scale also has high reliability and \nvalidity during its creation process (KMO = 0.909, p < 0.01, Cronbach’s \nα > 0.8). Therefore, although the sample size for creating this scale was \nsmall (19 boys and 17 girls), and there was no further development \nand validation in the data analysis process, it still has high \nreference value.\nBased on the above three scales, this study created the initial \nPRSS-C, which consists of 17 items corresponding to the FACE \ndivided into 5 components. The first 5 items represent Fascination, \nitems 6 to 8 represent Being-Away-ph, items 9 to 11 represent \nCompatibility, items 12 to 14 represent Being-Away-ps, and items \n15–17 represent Extent. In order to make the scale easier for \nchildren to understand, one scale compilation expert, two \nelementary school teachers, and one elementary school educator \ninspected and proposed corresponding modifications to the \nwording of each item in the scale to ensure its suitability for \nchildren, as shown in Table 1 .\nThe method of adapting each item in the initially created PRSS-C \nis shown in Table 2 . For example, the first item of the scale “I can hear \nmany interesting sounds” refers to the description of Fascination \ncomponents in the PRCS-C, “There are lots of interesting places in the \nschool ground, ” where the description of “interesting places” in the \ngeneral environment is changed to “interesting sounds, ” and the \nspecific range-related term “in the school ground” is removed to \nfacilitate other researchers’ use. The second item of the scale “This \nsound makes me want to hear more” directly quotes the description \nof Fascination components in the acoustic environment from the \nPRSS-C created by Ma et al.\n3 Experiment 1\nThe purpose of this experiment was to develop a test of the \ninitially created PRSS-C. The questionnaire data were first collected, \nafter which the initially created PRSS-C was developed using statistical \nanalysis of data in the following steps: (1) It was determined that each \nitem in the PRSS-C represents only one of the components of FACE; \n(2) The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients and the mean values of the item \ncorrelations were compared to determine the internal consistency of \nthe different components of FACE in the scale; (3) It was determined \nthat the number of extracted number of factors; (4) Extract the \nnumber of fixed factors to analyze the structure of the scale; Finally, \nanalyze the reliability and validity of the scale to determine whether \nthe scale was developed successfully.\nFirst, the Attention Restoration Theory ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ) \ndescribes that a restorative environment should contain four \ncomponents of FACE. Furthermore, it distinguishes between psychological and physical aspects of Being-Away, totaling five \ncomponents. The higher people perceive these five components in \ntheir environment, the greater its potential for restoration. Since the \nacoustic environment is a significant part of the general environment, \na good acoustic environment also possesses high restorative potential. \nThus, this study, based on the Attention Restoration Theory, divides \nthe items in the scale into five dimensions. This allows school-aged \nchildren to assess the extent of FACE contained in different acoustic \nenvironments, thereby evaluating the restoration potential of each \nacoustic environment. Therefore, it is anticipated that PRSS-C should \nbe  able to be  divided into five components in this experiment. \nSecondly, previous studies indicate that people prefer natural sounds \n(Y ang and Kang, 2005 ), and natural environments are significantly \nassociated with restorative environments ( Purcell et al., 2001 ; van den \nBerg et al., 2003 ). Specifically for children, natural sounds like flowing \nwater and bird calls promote children’s attention restoration ( Shu, \n2023 ). However, in this experiment, the three environments include \nmore natural elements in the forest areas near the city, predominantly \nnatural sounds. The suburban areas encompass both natural sounds \nand vehicle noises, while the city center is mainly dominated by \nvehicle noises. Therefore, it is expected that the forest areas near the \ncity have the highest potential for soundscape restoration, while the \ncity center has the lowest.\nIn summary, based on previous research findings and predictions \nof experimental results, two hypotheses are proposed:TABLE 1  The initial creation of PRSS-C is grouped according to attention \nrestoration theory.\nFascination\n1. I can hear many interesting sounds\n2. This sound makes me want to hear more\n3. These sounds make me wonder about things\n4. I find this sonic environment appealing\n5.

PRSS-C Can Be divided into five components: Fascination, \nbeing-away-ph, compatibility, being-away-ps, and extent.\n 2. For children, restorative potential of soundscapes Is lower In \nurban centers than In urban suburbs and lower In urban \nsuburbs than In urban peripheral forests.\nThis experiment was conducted in six classrooms, each with an \narea of 54 square meters. The room height, layout, building materials, \nsize and position of doors and windows, as well as the location of \nspeakers and TVs were all the same. Therefore, the reverberation time \nin all rooms was the same. Additionally, the sound level in each \nclassroom was controlled to be the same on the multimedia control \nend. Two teachers supervised the children’s answering in each \nclassroom. Throughout the experiment, all participants maintained \nrelative quietness, and there were no instances of mutual cheating or \nother sound interference. The experiment took place at noon, after \nparticipants had experienced a morning of classes, putting them in a \nnaturally fatigued state ( Hartig and Staats, 2006 ). Participants were \nthen asked to imagine themselves in the environments shown in the videos ( Laumann et al., 2001 ) and were informed that there were no \ncorrect answers to the questions, and they should respond based on \ntheir own perception of the sounds. Finally, they were evaluated \nusing PRSS-C.\n3.1 Experimental method\n3.1.1 Participants\nConsidering that younger children may have difficulty completing \nthe questionnaire, participants in this experiment were students in \ngrades 5–6 from Gonghua School in Changping District, Beijing, \ntotaling 185 individuals aged between 10 and 12 years old, including \n108 males and 77 females ( M = 11.25, SD = 0.44). The participants were \ndivided into three groups: Group 1 with 61 participants, Group 2 with \n62 participants, and Group  3 with 62 participants. Since each \nclassroom can accommodate a maximum of 40 students, participants \nfrom the three groups were evenly distributed into six classrooms in \nsequence to conduct the experiment simultaneously.

The experiment was conducted with the consent \nof teachers and parents and was approved by the Ethics Committee of \nInner Mongolia University of Technology.\n3.1.2 Experimental stimuli\nThe experimental stimuli for this study consisted of three \naudio-visual recordings, each lasting for 2 min. These listening \nsessions were recorded in August 2023, on a sunny and clear day. \nThe recording locations were the city center of Changping District, \nthe urban outskirts of Shijingshan District, and the wooded area \nwithin Fragrant Hills Park, all in Beijing. Images of the recording \nsites are shown in Figure 1 . The audio and video were captured \nusing a digital single-lens reflex camera (Canon EOS 600D) paired \nwith a dual-channel stereo microphone (MAMEN mic08). The \ncamera was positioned at the eye level of children, and the \nmicrophone was slightly below the camera height, positioned at the \near level of the children.\nThe audio-visual stimuli for the three experimental conditions \nwere reproduced in a classroom setting. The classroom was equipped \nwith an 84-inch color television (Hisense LED84XT900G3D) and two \nmultimedia speakers placed at the left and right upper corners of the \nroom. The sequence of video playback varied across the three \nconditions to control for order effects ( Payne, 2013 ) (1: urban outskirts \nwooded area, urban suburbs, city center; 2: city center, urban outskirts \nwooded area, urban suburbs; 3: urban suburbs, city center, urban \noutskirts wooded area).\nThe sounds recorded in the city center primarily include the \nsounds of vehicles driving and honking, pedestrian chatter and \nfootsteps, construction noise from nearby construction sites, and the \nfaint rustling of leaves when a summer breeze passes through. The \nsounds recorded in the suburban areas mainly consist of the chirping \nof cicadas in the summer, the gentle rustling of leaves when a summer \nbreeze passes through, pedestrian chatter and footsteps, along with \noccasional honking and driving sounds from passing vehicles. The \nsounds recorded in the forest areas near the city primarily include the \nchirping of birds and cicadas in the summer, the sound of a small \nstream flowing, along with occasional footsteps and chatter from \npassing pedestrians.\n3.1.3 Experimental scale\nThe scale utilized in Experiment 1 was the PRSS-C, originally \ndeveloped by the researchers and outlined in Table 1 . Each item in the scale represented a component of Attention Restoration Theory, with \nfive items indicating Fascination, three items representing Away-ph, \nthree items representing Compatibility, three items representing \nAway-ps, and three items representing Extent. The scale employed a \nfive-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 5, with options being \n“Strongly Disagree, ” “Disagree Somewhat, ” “Neither Agree nor \nDisagree, ” “ Agree Somewhat, ” and “Strongly Agree. ” Children were \nrequired to mark a check under each item based on their \nown perceptions.\nAll participants exhibited enthusiasm and interest in the \nexperiment, with the entire process being communicated by teachers \nand peers. The teachers had undergone a certain level of training and \nwere well-acquainted with each step of the experimental procedure. \nBefore initiating the experiment, the teachers provided an overview of \nthe process to the participants, emphasizing that there were no correct \nanswers for each item. Participants were instructed to respond based \non their personal perceptions of the sounds. Simultaneously, \nparticipants were asked to imagine themselves being present in the \nvideo environment during the presentation of audio-visual stimuli \n(Laumann et al., 2001 ).\n3.1.4 Experimental procedure\nBefore the commencement of the experiment, the instructor \nprovided participants with an introduction to the experimental \nprocedures. Participants were instructed to immerse themselves in the \ndescribed environment through imagination. Subsequently, survey \nquestionnaires were distributed, and participants were given the \nopportunity to read through the project. Any areas of confusion or \nlack of understanding were addressed by the instructor, with research \npersonnel noting such instances for later analysis.\nTo enhance children’s immersion in the acoustic environment, \nfollowing the experimental procedures described by Payne during the \ndevelopment of PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ) and by Ma and others during the \ncreation of PRSS-C ( Shu and Ma, 2018 ), The experiment commenced \nwith the presentation of audio-visual stimuli for a duration of 2 min, \nfollowing this, the visual stimuli were discontinued, and only the \naudio stimuli were played for an additional 2  min. After the \ncompletion of the audio stimuli, participants utilized the PRSS-C to \nassess the auditory scenes. This evaluation process was repeated for a \ntotal of three different environments, with each environment being \nrepeated once. The entire experimental session lasted approximately \n20 min, as illustrated in Figure 2 .\nFIGURE 1\nThree environments in Experiment 1. (A) urban peripheral forest. (B) urban suburb.

These \nanalyses were conducted following the analytical procedures outlined \nin the development of the PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ). The analyses were \nrepeated three times, once for each environment. Missing value \nanalysis revealed that all variables had missing values of less than 1%. \nMissing values were replaced with means, and a normality test \nindicated a skewed distribution. Due to the sample size exceeding 30 \nand the difficulty in transforming variables, the data were not \ntransformed into a normal distribution ( Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996 ).\nInitially, a preliminary principal axis analysis was conducted to \ndetermine whether each item in PRSS-C represented only one \ncomponent of FACE. The principal axis analysis was performed three \ntimes, once for each environment. Based on the eigenvalue greater than 1 criterion, both urban center and suburban areas extracted 5 \nfactors, while the urban periphery with wooded areas extracted 4 \nfactors. Items with factor loadings above 0.35 (high loadings) and \nbelow −0.35 (low loadings) were marked ( Payne, 2013 ) with gray \nshading to indicate their joint high or low loadings on multiple factors \nor no loading on any factor. Finally, items with high and low loadings \nconsistently across two or three environments were removed \n(Fascination 5 and Away-ps 13), as shown in Table 3 .\nNext, reliability analyses were conducted on the remaining 15 \nitems, repeated three times, once for each environment. The analysis \nresults showed high internal consistency for each environment (Forest \nArea: α = 0.873, Suburban Area: α = 0.829, City Center: α = 0.841). \nSubsequently, individual analyses were conducted on the FACE \ncomponents in each environment. Internal consistency between items \nis in the optimal range when the Mean Value of Inter-Item Correlations \nis between 0.2 and 0.4 ( Briggs and Cheek, 1986 ). The results of the \nanalyses showed that the internal consistency of each constituent in \nFIGURE 2\nExperimental process.\nTABLE 3  Rotated factor matrixa.\nUrban center Urban suburb Urban peripheral forest\nFactor Factor Factor\n1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4\nFascination1 0.716 0.151 <0.1 0.133 0.128 0.547 <0.1 0.192 0.531 <0.1 0.707 0.185 <0.1 <0.1\nFascination2 0.700 0.328 0.138 0.301 <0.1 0.704 0.267 0.162 0.184 0.111 0.768 0.360 0.152 0.130\nFascination3 0.713 0.208 <0.1 0.164 0.168 0.677 <0.1 0.213 <0.1 0.101 0.694 0.206 <0.1 0.249\nFascination4 0.808 <0.1 0.239 <0.1 <0.1 0.818 <0.1 0.194 0.107 0.133 0.663 0.230 0.194 0.283\nFascination5 0.483 −0.185 <0.1 0.409 <0.1 0.645 <0.1 <0.1 0.451 <0.1 0.663 0.195 0.107 0.179\nAaway-ph6 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 0.809 <0.1 0.146 <0.1 0.165 0.643 0.152 0.273 <0.1 0.588\nAway-ph7 <0.1 0.336 0.117 <0.1 0.314 0.172 0.303 <0.1 0.588 <0.1 0.147 0.740 0.208 0.115\nAway-ph8 0.407 0.237 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 0.287 0.270 0.404 <0.1 <0.1 0.833 0.168 0.161\nCompatibility9 0.104 <0.1 <0.1 0.953 −0.171 0.246 0.170 0.794 0.235 <0.1 0.776 <0.1 0.305 <0.1\nCompatibility10 0.135 <0.1 <0.1 0.675 <0.1 0.323 0.147 0.878 0.131 <0.1 0.721 <0.1 0.182 <0.1\nCompatibility11 0.358 0.663 <0.1 0.168 <0.1 <0.1 0.267 0.316 0.324 −0.364 0.137 0.205 0.413 −0.267\nAway-ps12 0.190 0.185 0.768 0.116 −0.120 0.106 0.956 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 0.171 0.160 0.607 <0.1\nAway-ps13 0.455 0.310 0.540 0.135 0.213 0.324 0.695 0.111 0.134 0.312 0.404 0.174 0.548 0.190\nAway-ps14 <0.1 0.110 0.816 <0.1 0.134 <0.1 0.835 0.208 0.112 <0.1 <0.1 0.122 0.649 0.362\nExtent15 <0.1 0.853 0.121 <0.1 <0.1 −0.335 <0.1 0.182 0.202 0.119 0.183 <0.1 <0.1 0.459\nExtent16 0.248 0.835 0.222 <0.1 0.115 <0.1 0.287 0.336 0.497 0.256 0.299 0.759 0.174 0.110\nExtent17 0.321 0.333 0.175 <0.1 0.198 <0.1 <0.1 0.241 0.578 0.168 0.314 0.737 0.101 0.128\nExtraction Method: Principal Axis Factoring.

The factor structure of the data was determined by \ncomparing the eigenvalues generated by the principal component \nanalysis for each environment with the random eigenvalues generated \nby parallel analysis ( Watkins, 2000 ). The rationale behind this method \nis that the eigenvalue of the last factor extracted should be greater than \nthe random data eigenvalues under comparable conditions. Although \nsome studies have advocated factor extraction based on scree plots \n(Bagot, 2004 ), a more rigorous approach involves comparing \neigenvalues generated by principal component analysis with those \ngenerated by parallel analysis ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ). The \nanalysis results indicated that a two-factor structure was suitable for \nall three environments, as depicted in Figure 3 .\nFourthly, a varimax rotation was applied to the principal \ncomponent analysis using the maximum variance method, extracting \na fixed number of two factors for each environment. The results of the \nanalysis varied for the three environments, with some items not \nloading onto the same factors. The factor structure loadings are \npresented in Table 5 . For the first factor, the variance percentages in \nthe Urban Periphery with Wooded Areas, Suburban Area, and Urban \nCenter were 26, 19, and 20%, respectively. For the second factor, the \nvariance percentages in the three environments were 25, 19, and 19%, \nrespectively. To assess whether the factor structure was consistent \nacross the three environments, it was necessary to examine the factor \nloadings of each item in the three environments to determine which factor each item loaded onto. The gray shaded areas in Table 5  indicate \nhigher loadings of items on that particular factor. By comparing the \nfactor structures across the three environments, it was observed that \nthe factor structures were similar, with the exception of Compatibility \n9 and Away-ps 15, which loaded onto different factors in the three \nenvironments. Factor 1 consists mainly of Away and Extent, referring \nto Factor 1 as the Away and Extent factor, and Factor 2 consists mainly \nof Fascination and Compatibility, referring to Factor 2 as the \nFascination and Compatibility factor.\nFinally, the scale underwent reliability and validity analyses. \nFirstly, reliability analyses were conducted on the items for each factor \nin these three environments. The results of the analysis showed that \nthe internal consistency of the items on these two factors was in the \noptimal range (0.2 < M < 0.4) in all three environments. Subsequently, \nvalidity analyses were performed on the scale, and the results indicated \nthat the scale had high validity (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure >0.7). \nAs shown in Table  6 , the scale demonstrated good reliability and \nvalidity (0.2 < M < 0.4; KMO > 0.7; p < 0.05). Therefore, a scale with a \ndual-factor structure consisting of 15 items was created. However, \nPRSS-C did not correspond to the five components of FACE, thus the \nfirst hypothesis was not supported.\nTo validate whether PRSS-C can differentiate the restorative \npotential of soundscapes in three different environments, the scores \nof each environment’s items were summed and averaged. By \ncomparing the average scores of these environments, the restorative \npotential of the three environments was evaluated ( Bagot, 2004 ). \nMean scores of the three environments were compared using one-way \nANOV A, and the results of the analysis showed that there was a \nsignificant difference between the mean scores of the three \nenvironments ( F  = 9.764, Sig. < 0.05), and then Post Hoc  Multiple \nComparisons using the LSD and S-N-K methods revealed that the TABLE 4  Mean value of inter-item correlations.\nUrban peripheral forest Urban suburb Urban center\nMean N of Items Mean N of Items Mean N of Items\nFascination 0.628 4 0.823 4 0.543 4\nAway-ph 0.471 3 0.398 3 0.175 3\nCompatibility 0.354 3 0.762 3 0.506 3\nAway-ps 0.432 2 0.914 2 0.842 2\nExtent 0.398 3 0.481 3 0.251 3\nFIGURE 3\nParallel analysis and principal component analysis of Scree plots.

The results indicated that PRSS-C, like PRSS, \nexhibited a bifactor structure. The scale successfully differentiated the \nrestorative potential of soundscapes in different environments within \nthe same city (urban center, suburban area, and peri-urban forest). \nOverall, due to the good reliability and validity of PRSS-C, a successful \ndevelopment of PRSS-C was achieved.\nFirstly, PRSS-C yielded a bifactor structure, where four items of \nFascination, Compatibility 9, Compatibility 10, and Extent 15 loaded TABLE 5  Rotated factor matrixa.\nUrban peripheral forest Urban suburb Urban center\nFactor Factor Factor\n1 2 1 2 1 2\nFascination1 0.204 0.751 0.321 0.581 0.320 0.658\nFascination2 0.423 0.749 0.243 0.726 0.405 0.740\nFascination3 0.276 0.728 0.705 0.367 0.622\nFascination4 0.353 0.701 0.874 0.314 0.632\nAway-ph6 0.466 0.167 0.209 0.135 0.170\nAway-ph7 0.820 0.113 0.446 0.186 0.379\nAway-ph8 0.879 0.520 0.197 0.323 0.258\nCompatibility9 0.839 0.538 0.472 −0.151 0.540\nCompatibility10 0.838 0.485 0.535 0.514\nCompatibility11 0.282 0.164 0.499 0.671 0.310\nAway-ps12 0.353 0.264 0.626 0.108 0.352 0.309\nAway-ps14 0.409 0.265 0.681 0.320 0.166\nExtent15 0.240 0.272 0.267 −0.196 0.758\nExtent16 0.824 0.241 0.632 0.163 0.856 0.173\nExtent17 0.789 0.250 0.337 0.187 0.515 0.150\nExtraction Method: Principal Axis Factoring.

This \nsuggests that children’s perceptions of the restorative potential of \nsoundscapes do not significantly differ in terms of physical and \npsychological experiences.\nSecondly, compared to PRCS-C, PRSS-C yielded a different \nnumber of factors, which could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, \nPRSS-C developed in this study only assessed the magnitude of \nsoundscape restorative potential from two dimensions. Secondly, \nconsidering the shorter attention span of children in this study, having \nmore scale items might result in lower reliability and validity. Hence, \nthis experiment only designed 17 items, but having more items might \ngenerate more factor structures.\nThirdly, as PRSS-C focused on children as the study population, \nit is more suitable for children compared to PRSS. Although both \nPRSS and PRSS-C initially divided the items into five dimensions \nregarding FACE during the initial creation phase, further development \nand validation revealed a bifactor structure for items in both scales. In \nPRSS, Fascination, Compatibility, and Extent loaded onto one factor, \nwhile Away loaded onto another factor. In PRSS-C, Fascination and \nCompatibility loaded onto one factor, while Extent and Away loaded \nonto another factor.\nFourthly, the internal consistency of the items on both factors of \nthe PRSS-C was in the optimal range (0.2 < M < 0.4) in all three \nenvironments. The entire scale demonstrated high validity in all three \nenvironments (KMO > 0.7, p < 0.05), indicating the successful \ndevelopment of the PRSS-C, consisting of a bifactor structure with \n15 items.\nFinally, as the scale did not divide into five components for FACE, \nproving that children’s perception of acoustic environments may differ \nfrom the restorative perception of general environments, Hypothesis \n1 was not supported. However, as predicted by Hypothesis 2, the \nrestorative potential of soundscapes in peri-urban forests was \nsignificantly higher than that in suburban areas, and the restorative \npotential in suburban areas was significantly higher than that in urban \ncenters. PRSS-C successfully differentiated the restorative potential of \nthree environments, confirming that soundscapes with more natural \nelements have greater restorative potential for children. Therefore, \nHypothesis 2 was supported.\n4 Experiment 2\nThe scale developed in Experiment 1 requires further validation. \nThe purpose of Experiment 2 is to determine the stability of the factor \nstructure of the scale and investigate whether children can use it to \ndifferentiate the restorative potential of similar environmental \nsoundscapes. If PRSS-C can distinguish the restorative potential of \ntwo similar environments and the factor structure of the scale is stable, \nthe value of PRSS-C as a tool for assessing children’s perceptual \nrestorative soundscapes will be further enhanced.\nFirstly, the purpose of this experiment is to further validate the \nPRSS-C developed in Experiment 1. The data analysis process is \nconsistent with that of Experiment 1. The validation process aims to cross-verify the initial analysis results and examine whether the data \nanalysis results of the development process can be replicated ( Devellis \nand Thorpe, 1991 ). Therefore, it is expected that the PRSS-C in this \nexperiment can be  divided into two components similar to \nExperiment 1.\nSecondly, Payne (2013)  found that when further validating the \ndeveloped PRSS in 2013, the potential for soundscape restoration in \nthe Weston Park with lower vegetation coverage, smaller area, and \nlouder sound was lower compared to the botanical garden with higher \nvegetation coverage, larger area, and quieter sound. In this experiment, \nto further validate the developed PRSS-C from Experiment 1 and \nexamine whether PRSS-C distinguishes the potential for soundscape \nrestoration in similar environments, two similar environments (the \nNational Botanical Garden and the Temple of Heaven Park) in the \nsame city (Beijing) were selected. The sound pressure levels of the two \nparks were compared using the TES1359A sound level meter. \nMeasurements were taken in mid-August 2023, selecting 15 locations \nalong the tour routes in each park. Ten measurements were taken at \neach location with a two-minute interval between measurements. \nMeasurements were taken from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. for 2 days in \neach park, totaling 4 days. A total of 600 sound level data points for \nthe two parks were recorded. Subsequently, an independent sample \nt-test was used to compare the sound levels of the two parks. The \nanalysis results showed that the sound level in the botanical garden \n(M = 54.9, SD = 8.8) was lower than that in the Temple of Heaven Park \n(M = 64.8, SD = 4.2), and this difference was statistically significant \n(t = −17.5, Sig. = 0.000 < 0.05). Therefore, it is predicted that in this \nexperiment, compared to the Temple of Heaven Park, the botanical \ngarden, which is larger, quieter, and has higher vegetation coverage, \nhas higher soundscape restoration potential.\nBased on the data analysis results of Experiment 1 and the \nprediction of the potential for soundscape restoration in the National \nBotanical Garden and the Temple of Heaven Park, two hypotheses \nare proposed:\n 1. The items in PRSS-C will be divided into two components, \nconsistent with the results of Experiment 1.\n 2. For children, potential of soundscapes in Temple of Heaven \nPark is lower than in the National Botanical Garden.\nThis experiment was conducted in a classroom similar to \nExperiment 1. All physical properties of the classroom were the \nsame as those in Experiment 1. The experiment took place at noon \nafter participants had undergone a morning of classes, placing them \nin a naturally fatigued state. Participants were then asked to imagine \nthemselves in the environment shown in the video and were \ninformed that there were no correct answers to the questions, and \nthey should respond based on their own perception of the sounds. \nFinally, the PRSS-C developed in Experiment 1 was used \nfor evaluation.\n4.1 Experimental method\n4.1.1 Participants\nThe participants of this experiment were students in grades 5–6 \nfrom Gonghua School in Changping District, Beijing.

All participants were \nevenly distributed across 8 classrooms and had normal hearing \nabilities. The experiment was conducted with the consent of both \nteachers and parents, and it received approval from the Ethics \nCommittee of Inner Mongolia University of Technology.\n4.1.2 Experimental stimuli\nThe experimental stimuli for this study consisted of two audio-\nvisual recordings, each lasting for 2 min. These recordings were \ncaptured at the end of August 2023, on a sunny and clear day. The \nrecording locations were the Beijing Botanical Garden and the Temple \nof Heaven Park in Beijing, as depicted in Figure 4 . The recording \nequipment and methods were consistent with those used in \nExperiment 1. For Experiment 2, the audio-visual stimuli were \nreproduced in a classroom setting. The classroom was equipped with \nan 84-inch color television and two multimedia speakers (Hisense \nLED84XT900G3D), positioned in the upper left and upper right \ncorners of the classroom, respectively.\nThe recordings from the botanical garden primarily include the \nrustling sound of leaves in the summer breeze, cicadas and birds \nchirping in the summer, the gentle flowing sound of water when the \nbreeze passes over the lake’s surface in summer, as well as the voices \nand footsteps of visitors. The recordings from the Temple of Heaven \nPark mainly consist of the voices and footsteps of visitors, cicadas \nchirping, a small amount of bird calls, and the rustling sound of leaves \nin the summer breeze.\n4.1.3 Experimental scale\nIn Experiment 2, the scale developed in Experiment 1 was used. \nSince the participants in both experiments were Chinese children, the \nscales used in both experiments were in Chinese. The scale developed \nin Experiment One underwent data analysis, resulting in the removal \nof items Fascination 5 and Compatibility 13. The refined scale, as \npresented in Table  7 , consists of 15 items. Each item represents a \ncomponent of the Attention Restoration Theory, with four items \nindicating Fascination, three items for Away-ph, two items for \nCompatibility, three items for Away-ps, and three items for Extent. \nThe scale adopts a five-point Likert scale, where respondents can \nexpress their agreement on a continuum from 1 to 5: “Strongly \nDisagree, ” “Disagree a Little, ” “Neither Agree nor Disagree, ” “ Agree a \nLittle, ” and “Strongly Agree. ”In Experiment Two, the entire process continued to involve \ncommunication between the teachers and the students. These teachers \nhad undergone a certain level of training and possessed a detailed \nunderstanding of each step of the experimental procedure. Before the \ncommencement of the experiment, the teachers provided participants \nwith an overview of the process. Participants were informed that there \nwere no correct answers for each item and were encouraged to \nrespond based on their own perceptions of the sounds. Additionally, \nparticipants were instructed to imagine themselves immersed in the \nvideo environment while experiencing the audio-visual stimuli.\nFIGURE 4\nTwo environments in Experiment 2.

Prior to the start of the experiment, teachers \nprovided participants with an introduction to the experimental \nprocedure, encouraging them to imagine themselves in the described \nenvironments. Subsequently, participants were given the survey \nquestionnaire to read. Any areas of confusion or lack of understanding \nwere addressed by the teachers, and the research personnel marked \nthose specific items.\nThe experiment commenced with the presentation of audio-visual \nstimuli for 2 min. Following this, the visual stimuli were turned off, \nand only the identical audio stimuli continued for an additional 2 min. \nAfter the audio stimuli, participants used the PRSS-C developed in \nExperiment One to assess the auditory scenes. This process was \nrepeated for each of the two environments, resulting in a total duration \nof approximately 15 min for the entire experiment.\n4.2 Experimental analysis\nThe data analysis process for Experiment Two replicated the \nanalysis process used in Experiment One for the development of \nPRSS-C. SPSS (version 26) was employed for a series of analyses to \nverify whether the developed PRSS-C exhibited a stable factor \nstructure and could differentiate the auditory restorativeness \npotential of similar environments. The analyses were repeated \ntwice, once for each environment. The results of the missing value \nanalysis indicated that missing values for all variables were less than \n1%. Missing values were replaced with the mean, and similar to \nExperiment One, the data exhibited a skewed distribution. Due to \nthe sample size being greater than 30 and the difficulty of transforming variables, the data were not transformed into a normal \ndistribution. Using an independent samples t-test, the analysis was \nconducted to examine whether there were significant differences in \nperceptual outcomes between children who participated in the \nexperiment for the first time and those who participated for the \nsecond time. The analysis results indicate that there were no \nsignificant differences (Sig. > 0.05) in perceptual outcomes for both \nthe acoustic environments of the Temple of Heaven Park and the \nbotanical garden between children who participated in the \nexperiment for the first time and those who participated for the \nsecond time. This suggests that the number of times children \nparticipated in the experiment did not affect the accuracy of the \nexperimental results in this study.\nFirstly, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted twice, once \nfor each environment. Following the principle of extracting factors \nwith eigenvalues greater than 1, five factors were extracted for both \nthe Botanical Garden and the Temple of Heaven Park. Items with high \nfactor loadings (>0.35) and low factor loadings (<0.35) were marked \nwith gray shading and listed in Table 8 . Items that loaded heavily on \nmultiple factors or failed to load on any factor were eventually \nremoved, such as Fascination 4, which exhibited high loadings in \nboth environments.\nSubsequently, reliability analyses were conducted on the \nremaining 14 items, with the analysis repeated twice, once for each \nenvironment. The results indicated high internal consistency for each \nenvironment (Temple of Heaven Park α = 0.753, Botanical Garden \nα = 0.781). Following this, separate analyses were conducted for the \nFACE components in each environment. The results of the analysis \nshow that the internal consistency of the items of the Compatibility \ncomponent in two similar environments is in the optimal range, as \nshown in Table 9 .TABLE 8  Rotated factor matrixa.\nNational Botanical Garden The Temple of Heaven Park\nFactor Factor\n1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5\nFascination1 0.665 <0.1 0.237 0.312 <0.1 0.693 <0.1 0.322 <0.1 <0.1\nFascination2 0.604 0.163 0.364 0.231 <0.1 0.633 0.247 0.252 <0.1 <0.1\nFascination3 0.647 <0.1 0.224 0.227 <0.1 0.439 <0.1 0.355 <0.1 0.228\nFascination4 0.796 <0.1 0.412 <0.1 <0.1 0.576 0.103 0.377 −0.194 0.108\nAway-ph5 −0.107 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 0.484 <0.1 0.100 0.223 0.747 −0.161\nAway-ph6 0.361 0.432 <0.1 0.282 <0.1 0.306 <0.1 0.527 −0.307 0.265\nAway-ph7 0.357 0.124 <0.1 −0.135 0.563 <0.1 0.164 0.498 0.115 <0.1\nCompatibility8 0.131 0.120 0.750 <0.1 0.124 0.645 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 0.136\nCompatibility9 0.250 0.121 0.801 0.115 <0.1 0.789 <0.1 −0.161 <0.1 0.140\nCompatibility10 0.380 0.170 <0.1 <0.1 0.227 0.218 <0.1 <0.1 −0.241 0.171\nAway-ps11 <0.1 0.886 0.183 <0.1 0.110 0.157 0.903 0.172 <0.1 <0.1\nAway-ps12 <0.1 0.941 0.193 <0.1 0.140 <0.1 0.723 0.123 0.149 <0.1\nExtent13 <0.1 <0.1 0.217 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 0.169 <0.1 0.390 0.167\nExtent14 0.246 <0.1 <0.1 0.448 <0.1 0.295 <0.1 0.178 <0.1 0.649\nExtent15 0.168 <0.1 0.224 0.567 0.329 <0.1 <0.1 0.553 <0.1 <0.1\nExtraction Method: Principal Axis Factoring.

The factor structure was determined by comparing the \neigenvalues generated by the principal component analysis with the \nrandom eigenvalues generated by parallel analysis. The results \nindicated that a two-factor structure was suitable for both \nenvironments, as illustrated in Figure 5 .\nFourthly, a maximum variance method rotation was applied to the \nprincipal component analysis for each environment, extracting a fixed \nnumber of two factors. The analysis results for both environments \nwere similar, with only Away-ph 5 and Extent 13 loading onto different \nfactors. The factor structure loadings are presented in Table 10 , where \nshaded areas indicate higher loadings on that factor. For the first \nfactor, the variance percentages for the Botanical Garden and Temple \nof Heaven Park environments were 21% each. For the second factor, \nthe variance percentages were 15% for the Botanical Garden and 12% \nfor the Temple of Heaven Park. Comparing the factor structures \nbetween the two environments revealed similarities. In the Botanical \nGarden environment, three items from Fascination, three items from \nCompatibility, and Away-ph 6 and 7 loaded onto Factor 1, while \nAway-ph 5 and two items from Away-ps loaded onto Factor 2. In the \nTemple of Heaven Park environment, three items from Fascination, \nAway-ph 6, three items from Compatibility, and Extent 14 and 15 \nloaded onto Factor 1, while Away-ph 5 and 7, two items from Away-ps, \nand Degree 13 loaded onto Factor 2.\nFinally, reliability and validity analyses were conducted on the \nscale. Firstly, reliability analyses were performed on each factor’s items in both environments. The results of the analysis showed that the \ninternal consistency of items on both factors in two similar \nenvironments was in the optimal range (0.2 < M < 0.4). Subsequently, \nvalidity analyses were conducted on the scale, revealing high validity \n(KMO > 0.7). As shown in Table 11 , the scale demonstrated good \nreliability and validity (0.2 < M < 0.4; KMO > 0.7; p < 0.05). Therefore, \nthe developed PRSS-C yielded a dual-factor structure as predicted, \nsupporting Hypothesis 1.\nTo validate the restorative potential of the developed PRSS-C in \ndistinguishing similar environmental scenes, the scores for each \nenvironmental setting were aggregated. A paired-sample t-test was \nemployed to assess the restorative potential of the acoustic scenes in \nthese two environments. The analysis revealed that the environmental \nscore in the botanical garden ( M = 3.44, SD = 0.56) was significantly \nhigher than that in the urban outskirts ( M = 3.07, SD = 0.57), with a \nstatistically significant difference ( t = 5.02, Sig. < 0.05). Subsequently, \nthe general factor scores and Away factor scores between the two \nenvironments were compared. The analysis revealed that the general \nfactor score in the botanical garden ( M = 3.65, SD = 0.68) was greater \nthan that in the Temple of Heaven Park ( M = 3.19, SD = 0.67), and this \ndifference was statistically significant ( t = 5.02, Sig. < 0.05). Similarly, \nthe Away factor score in the botanical garden ( M = 3.73, SD = 0.78) was \ngreater than that in the Temple of Heaven Park ( M = 3.49, SD = 0.77), \nand this difference was statistically significant ( t = 2.31, Sig. < 0.05). As \nexpected, the perceived restorativeness potential of the botanical \ngarden was significantly higher than that of the Temple of Heaven \nPark. Therefore, the second hypothesis is supported.\nFIGURE 5\nParallel analysis and principal component analysis of Scree plots. (A) the Temple of Heaven Park.

The \nresults indicated a certain stability in the factor structure of PRSS-C, \nand children successfully differentiated the restorative potential of \nsoundscapes between the botanical garden and the Temple of Heaven \nPark. This further demonstrates that soundscapes with more natural \nelements have greater restorative potential for children.\nCompared to Experiment 1, the PRSS-C in Experiment 2 also \nexhibited a dual-factor structure. However, the same items loaded \nonto different factors in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Specifically, \nin Experiment 1, Fascination and Compatibility loaded onto one \nfactor, while Extent and Being-Away loaded onto another. In \nExperiment 2, Fascination, Compatibility, and Extent loaded onto one \nfactor, while Being-Away loaded onto another. Several reasons could \naccount for this discrepancy. Firstly, sample differences: the samples \nused during the development and validation processes may have had \ndifferent characteristics, such as varying socioeconomic backgrounds. \nDifferences in sample characteristics could lead to variations in the \ndegree of association between different items and factors across \nsamples, thereby resulting in inconsistent factor structures. Secondly, sample size and effect size: Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 had \ndifferent sample sizes, and the magnitude of effects may also vary. The \nsize of the sample and effect size could influence the stability of the \nfactor structure. Smaller sample sizes or smaller effects might make \nthe factor structure more susceptible to the influence of individual \ndata points within the sample, thereby leading to differences across \ndifferent samples. Thirdly, changes in scale content: in Experiment 2, \nmodification or removal of items, such as the removal of Fascination \n4 through principal axis analysis, could affect the factor structure.\nDespite the fact that the same items did not consistently load onto \nthe same factors across Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, both \nexperiments overall yielded similar dual-factor structures. This \ndemonstrates that the PRSS-C exhibits a degree of stability and \nconsistency across different samples or datasets, thus enhancing the \nvalue of the scale. Compared to the development process of the PRSS \n(Payne, 2013 ), PRSS-C yielded a bifactor structure when assessing the \nrestorative potential of similar environments. This discrepancy might \nbe attributed to the heightened perceptual sensitivity of children to \nacoustic environments compared to adults. Compared to the \ndevelopment process of the PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ), the PRSS-C in \nExperiment 2 still did not yield specific components corresponding to \neach aspect of FACE. The PRSS-C developed in this study can only \nassess the magnitude of restorativeness potential from two dimensions.TABLE 11  Mean value of inter-item correlations.\nFactor Mean KMO p\nNational Botanical Garden Factor 1 0.236 0.711 0.000\nFactor 2 0.395\nThe Temple of Heaven Park Factor 1 0.294 0.758 0.000\nFactor 2 0.354TABLE 10  Rotated factor matrixa.\nNational Botanical Garden the Temple of Heaven Park\nFactor Factor\n1 2 1 2\nFascination1 0.766 0.705 0.136\nFascination2 0.758 0.158 0.686 0.238\nFascination3 0.660 0.590\nAway-ph5 0.146 −0.114 0.373\nAway-ph6 0.425 0.337 0.556\nAway-ph7 0.280 0.210 0.158 0.353\nCompatibility8 0.480 0.228 0.608\nCompatibility9 0.587 0.188 0.651 −0.151\nCompatibility10 0.306 0.152 0.317\nAway-ps11 0.122 0.905 0.217 0.753\nAway-ps12 0.138 0.971 0.736\nExtent13 0.150 −0.142 0.246\nExtent14 0.360 0.481\nExtent15 0.465 0.270 0.267\nExtraction Method: Principal Axis Factoring.

Therefore, both \nhypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 were supported.\n5 General discussion\nThrough two experiments, we have demonstrated that PRSS-C \nenables children to differentiate the restorative potential of \nsoundscapes in different environments (urban peripheral forest areas, \nsuburban areas, urban centers) and similar environments (botanical \ngardens, Temple of Heaven Park). Additionally, PRSS-C exhibits a \nstable dual-factor structure with good reliability and validity ( Briggs \nand Cheek, 1986 ) (α > 0.7; KMO > 0.7; p < 0.05). Consequently, we have \nsuccessfully developed a perceptual restorative soundscapes scale for \nchildren, consisting of 14 items with a dual-factor structure. This scale \ncan be  used to assess the restorative potential of soundscapes in \nchildren’s activity spaces, thereby improving the quality of the acoustic \nenvironment surrounding children.\nIn both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, PRSS-C yielded a dual-\nfactor structure. Although some identical items loaded onto different \nfactors in these environments (Experiment 1: Compatibility 9 and \nAway-ps 15; Experiment 2: Away-ph 5 and Extent 13), most items \nloaded onto the same factors. This suggests that PRSS-C produced a \nmore similar factor structure in both experiments. While differences \nin factor structure across environments have been observed in the \ndevelopment of other related soundscape scales ( Payne, 2013 ), \ncontinuous improvements to PRSS-C have resulted in a more stable \nfactor structure across diverse environments, enhancing the scale’s \noverall value.\nComparing the development process of the PRSS-C with the PRSS \n(Payne, 2013 ), PRSS-C similarly produced two-factor structure when \nassessing the restorative potential of soundscapes in three different \nenvironments. However, different items were included in each factor. \nIn PRSS, the factor of “Being-Away” was split into two components \n(Away-Go and Away-Come), whereas in PRSS-C, “Being-Away” was \nnot split into two components, except in the urban peripheral forest \narea where Away-ps 15 was an exception. This difference may \nbe attributed to significant distinctions in children’s perceptions of \nleaving in psychological and physical contexts compared to adults \nwhen perceiving the acoustic environment. When assessing the \nrestorative potential of similar environments, PRSS and PRSS-C \nexhibited different factor structures. PRSS extracted only a single \nfactor, while PRSS-C extracted two different factors, suggesting that \nchildren’s perceptions may be  more sensitive than adults when \nperceiving the restorative potential of similar acoustic environments.\nCompared to the development process of a general perceptual \nrestorative scale for children (PRCS-C) ( Bagot, 2004 ), PRSS-C did not \nyield a five-factor structure. This could be attributed to several factors. \nFirstly, PRCS-C consists of 23 items, while PRSS-C has only 17 items; \na greater number of items may lead to more diverse factor structures. \nSecondly, PRCS-C employed gravel maps for factor extraction, \nwhereas PRSS-C utilized parallel analysis to compare eigenvalues \ngenerated by feature extraction and principal component analysis. \nLastly, compared to general environments, acoustic environments may not contain as many environmental elements, thus limiting the \nemergence of diverse factor structures. Although early stages of \ndeveloping perceptual restorative scales did not yield multifactor \nstructures ( Hartig et al., 1997 ), and similar multifactor structures were \nnot observed when developing perceptual restorative soundscapes \nscales for adults in general environments ( Payne, 2013 ), it is still \nnecessary to further refine PRSS-C to align with attention restoration \ntheory ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ) and establish a multifactor structure.\nAlthough PRSS-C did not form a five-factor structure for each \ncomponent in FACE, conducting reliability analysis for each \ncomponent in FACE is still valuable. For example, in Experiment 2, \nreliability analyses were conducted for each component of FACE. The \nanalysis revealed that Fascination and Away-ps components exhibited \nhigh internal consistency. However, when extracting two fixed factors, \nthese two components were loaded onto different factors. This \nindicates that Fascination and Away-ps components are two crucial \naspects when children assess the restorativeness potential of acoustic \nenvironments. Improving PRSS-C by increasing the number of items \nand sample size allows the scale to establish a stable factor structure \nfor each component in FACE. This enhancement enables \ncomprehensive exploration of the different restorative components \n(FACE) provided by various environmental types for children. \nIdentifying which aspect of the restorative components in FACE can \nsignificantly enhance the soundscape’s restorative potential will help \nimprove the acoustic environment for children.\nIn Experiment 1, the cumulative percentage of explained variance \nby factor loading ranged from 38 to 51%, while in Experiment 2, it \nranged from 33 to 36%. This is comparable to the cumulative variance \npercentage for PRSS (36–45%) ( Payne, 2013 ). However, when \ncompared to general PRCS-C (47–61%) ( Bagot, 2004 ) and other \nrelated scales (35–70%) ( Korpela and Hartig, 1996 ; Laumann et al., \n2001 ; Ivarsson and Hagerhall, 2008 ), the cumulative variance \npercentage in PRSS-C is relatively lower. This discrepancy may \nbe attributed to the rapid physical and psychological development of \nchildren, making them highly susceptible to the influence of their \nsurroundings ( Ferguson et al., 2013 ). Children’s heightened sensitivity \nto their environment may result in significantly different perceptions \nof acoustic environments and general environments. Additionally, \nfactors such as fatigue, individual differences among children, visual \nelements, olfactory factors, etc., could also influence children’s \nassessments of soundscape restorativeness. Therefore, when using \nPRSS-C for restorativeness assessments in different acoustic \nenvironments, consideration should be  given to these \ninfluencing factors.\n6 Conclusion and outlook\nThis study collected assessment data from 445 children and \ndeveloped and validated a perceptual restorative soundscapes scale for \nchildren using survey questionnaires and data analysis methods. \nThrough hypothesis testing, the study explored the characteristics of \nchildren’s perception of restorative soundscapes. The results indicate \nthat the reliability and validity of the scale are good. It was \ndemonstrated that children’s perception of the acoustic environment \nis divided into two components, and soundscapes with more natural \nelements have greater restorative potential for children. A comparison \nwith PRSS and PRCS-C revealed differences in children’s perception"

Children may \nbe more sensitive to the perception of restorative potential in similar \nenvironments, and their perception of acoustic environments differs \nfrom general environments. Unlike the assessment of general \nenvironments, there was no formation of a five-factor structure when \nevaluating acoustic environments. Therefore, developing a perceptual \nrestorative soundscapes assessment scale specifically for children is of \nsignificant importance.\nUsing PRSS-C, children can significantly differentiate the \nrestorative potential of soundscapes in different environmental types \n(urban peripheral forest areas, suburban areas, urban centers) and \nsimilar environments (botanical gardens, Temple of Heaven Park). \nThis study is expected to contribute to the existing database on the \ncharacteristics of children’s soundscape perception, providing an \neffective assessment tool for studying children’s perception of \nrestorative soundscapes.\nAlthough this study successfully developed and validated the \neffectiveness of PRSS-C through two experiments, it still has certain \nlimitations. Firstly, despite the high correlation between photo-\nbased judgments and on-site judgments in studies of environmental \npreference, and the extensive use of photos or videos as \nexperimental stimuli in many studies ( Laumann et al., 2001 ; Payne, \n2013 ; Shu and Ma, 2018 ), considering that children’s perceptual \nrestoration of sound scapes may differ from that of adults, it is \nnecessary to conduct on-site research to enhance the experiential \nand immersive aspects of the environment. Secondly, PRSS-C did \nnot form a five-factor structure for every component in FACE, and \nthe cumulative variance percentage of the two-factor structure has \nnot reached a satisfactory level. Therefore, further improvements to \nPRSS-C are necessary, such as extensively collecting children’s \nunderstanding of different scale items, increasing the number of \nitems and sample size, etc. Lastly, because the focus of this study is \non the development and validation of PRSS-C, there was no deeper \nexploration of individual factors such as age, gender, and family \neconomic status on children’s perceptual restoration of soundscapes, \nas well as the effects of acoustic indicators such as sound level, \nreverberation time, loudness, sharpness, roughness, etc., on \nchildren’s perceptual restoration of soundscapes.\nGiven the limitations of this study, future research can further \nimprove PRSS-C through methods such as on-site experiments and \nadding scale items, which will make PRSS-C a more scientifically \neffective tool for assessing children’s soundscapes. Furthermore, in \nfuture research, a deeper exploration of individual differences and the \nimpact of acoustic indicators on children’s perceptual restoration of \nsoundscapes can be conducted, which will assist architects, planners, \nand childhood educators in creating a conducive acoustic environment \nfor children.Data availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in \nthe article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed \nto the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by Ethics Committee \nof the College of Architecture, Inner Mongolia University of \nTechnology.
