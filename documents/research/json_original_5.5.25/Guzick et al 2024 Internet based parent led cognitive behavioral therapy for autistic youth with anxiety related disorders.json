Module completion predicted improved treatment outcome, though there was no difference in \nmodule completion across groups. Therapists spent an average of 16.29 min/family/week (SD 7.11) in the \niCBT-Email condition and 24.13 min/family/week (SD 6.84) in the iCBT-Video condition. Email and \ntelehealth-supported, parent-led iCBT both appear to be effective treatments for autistic youth with anxiety \ndisorders that require reduced therapist effort.

Autistic youth often struggle with a number of mental health \nconditions, with anxiety-related disorders being among the most com-\nmon in this population (Kirsch et al., 2020 ; van Steensel et al., 2011 ). \nClinical anxiety confers significant functional impairment in autistic \nyouth (Kerns et al., 2015 ) and is likely to worsen as youth enter \nadolescence and adulthood (Gotham et al., 2015 ; Uljarevi ˘c et al., 2020 ).An increasing recognition of the prevalence and impact of anxiety in \nthis population has led to an acceleration of treatment research in the \npast decade, with particular interest in cognitive behavioral therapy \n(CBT) due to its strong evidence base for anxiety-related disorders in \nnon-autistic youth (Sharma et al., 2021 ; Wood et al., 2020 ). Several \nrandomized trials have now demonstrated strong efficacy of CBT rela-\ntive to comparison conditions for this population (g .88; Sharma et al., \n2021 ). Although CBT as it was designed for non-autistic youth is effi-\ncacious, one randomized trial comparing traditional CBT to CBT adapted \nfor autistic youth suggested modifications for autistic youth lead to in-\ncremental benefits, as youth in the adapted condition experienced \n*Corresponding author. 3535 Market St., Ste 6-600, Philadelphia, PA, 19046, USA.\nE-mail address: andrew.guzick@pennmedicine.upenn.edu (A.G.

      "text": "significantly improved outcomes in this study (Wood et al., 2020 ).\nRegardless, there are tremendous barriers to accessing adapted CBT \nfor this population, as it is time-intensive, costly, and rarely available in \ncommunity settings (Reardon et al., 2020 ; Salloum et al., 2016 ). Further, \nthere is a significant shortage of providers trained in CBT for children \nand adolescents (Frank et al., 2020 ). Although this problem is significant \nfor all youth, these barriers are even more substantial among those on \nthe autism spectrum, as there is often a disconnect between develop -\nmental services (where this population is often seen) and mental health \nservices. Moreover, providers are often hesitant to provide therapy for \nautistic youth (Adams & Young, 2021 ; Maddox et al., 2021 ). For these \nreasons, developing lower-cost, more scalable approaches for this pop-\nulation is of utmost importance.\nInternet-delivered CBT (iCBT) has been proposed as a novel form of \ndelivery that has the potential to increase access to CBT, reduce costs, \nand save therapist time, while maintaining efficacy (Andersson et al., \n2019 ). These approaches generally involve automated educational and \ninteractive material that youth and parents complete in their own time \nwith minimal therapist contact, ranging from asynchronous messaging \nto occasional phone/telehealth contact to provide support as they work \nthrough a self-directed program. Self-directed programs for youth with \nanxiety disorders usually follow a parent-led approach, in which parents \ntake on the role of a therapist and coach with support from a clinician. \nThis format has been recommended as parents may be more likely to \ngeneralize concepts from CBT, help their child apply them in real time, \nand are often more motivated to engage in difficult behavior change \nrelated to child anxiety (Creswell et al., 2022 ). Several studies have \nshown non-inferiority of parent-led CBT relative to therapist-delivered \nindividual treatment for non-autistic youth with anxiety disorders \n(Creswell et al., 2022 ; Rapee et al., 2017 ), with recent research \ndemonstrating similar treatment outcomes for autistic youth (Guzick \net al., 2023 ). Leveraging digital health and parent coaching promises to \nbe a lower cost method to scale CBT for autistic youth.\nTo date, there has been minimal research on digitally delivered CBT \nfor autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders. One pilot study of an \niCBT program for autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders \ncompared two levels of therapist support. In this 12-week program, eight \nparent-youth dyads were randomized to receive either biweekly, 30-min \nvideo calls with a therapist in addition to weekly email support (iCBT- \nVideo) or weekly email support only (iCBT-Email) (Guzick et al., 2023 ). \nAll families participated in parent- and child-specific web-based mod-\nules between therapist contacts, with parents being encouraged to guide \ntheir child through their content. Overall, treatment outcomes were \npromising, with five of seven completers being classified as treatment \nresponders and an overall symptom reduction of 39% on the Pediatric \nAnxiety Rating Scale modified for Autism (PARS-A; Maddox et al., \n2020 ), including a 55% reduction in iCBT-Video and a 22% reduction in \niCBT-Email [blinded citation].\nICBT for non-autistic youth has incorporated different levels of \nprofessional support in the form of a therapist or “coach,” with greater \ninvolvement generally being associated with improved outcomes (Grist \net al., 2019 ; Werntz et al., 2023 ). In addition to providing clarification \non therapeutic concepts, more contact with a professional during digital \nmental health interventions is believed to confer more “supportive \naccountability,” leading to greater engagement with therapeutic mate-\nrial and less dropout (Meyerhoff et al., 2021 ). Indeed, several studies \nshow that more human support leads to more engagement in digital \nmental health interventions (though it is also worth noting several \nnon-significant findings in this literature as well; Lipschitz et al., 2023 ). \nIn parent-led interventions, greater parental participation leads to \nimproved outcomes (Riddle et al., 2024 ). Thus, it may be that increased \nparticipation in therapeutic content is a mechanism by which more \ntherapist contact leads to improved treatment outcomes in parent-led \ndigital mental health interventions. That said, there are diminishing \nreturns of therapist involvement at a certain point when considering the \nbalance of efficacy and scalability in digital mental health interventions that should be considered in treatment development.\nThis study expanded on preliminary findings by testing two versions \nof iCBT for autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders, one with \nweekly email contact (iCBT-Email), and one with alternating bi-weekly \nemail contact and 30-min telehealth coaching calls (iCBT-Video). The \nprimary aim was to test whether families in iCBT-Video would experi -\nence improved treatment outcomes. A secondary aim was to test \nwhether greater engagement with iCBT content in the iCBT-Video con-\ndition would be a mechanism accounting for improved treatment out-\ncomes among families in this condition. It was expected that families \nrandomized to iCBT-Video would engage with more iCBT content and \nthus experience improved treatment outcomes compared to families in \nthe iCBT-Email condition. Other secondary exploratory aims were to \ncompare satisfaction and dropout across the two treatment conditions. \nWe also compared the amount of therapist time required in each con-\ndition, with more therapist time expected in iCBT-Video.\n2.Methods\n2.1. Participants\nParticipants were recruited from a variety of sources throughout the \nstate of Texas including autism-focused organizations, mental health \nand developmental clinics and professionals, research databases (e.g., \nSPARK, ResearchMatch), social media platforms (e.g., Facebook), \ncommunity organizations (e.g., advocacy groups, schools, churches, \nyouth centers, local businesses, non-profits), and word of mouth. \nRecruitment began in July 2022 and ended in March 2023.\nParents interested in participating first completed a 30-min pre- \nscreening phone call with a member of the study team to determine \ntheir child’s likely eligibility prior to scheduling a virtual baseline \nassessment. Written and verbal consent/assent was obtained prior to \nbeginning the baseline assessment, during which parent and child \ncompleted a series of interview-rated assessments and questionnaires \nwith a trained independent evaluator to determine final eligibility. In-\ndependent evaluators were trained by reviewing assessments with a \nlicensed psychologist experienced in the measures, rating mock assess -\nments to ensure reliability with the team, administering an initial \nassessment with the support of an experienced rater, and weekly su-\npervisions with a supervising psychologist. Independent evaluators were \nblind to treatment condition.\nInclusion criteria required the following: (1) a child age of 7–15 years \nat time of enrollment, (2) a prior diagnosis of autism according to gold- \nstandard assessment procedures (e.g., Autism Diagnostic Observation \nSchedule, Second Edition [ADOS-2]; Childhood Autism Rating Scale, \nSecond Edition [CARS-2]) verified by a written report and reviewed by a \nclinical psychologist on the study team, (3) a primary diagnosis of an \nanxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder on the Mini International \nNeuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID; \nSheehan et al., 2010 ), (4) a score of 70 or higher on the Kaufman Brief \nIntelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2; Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004 ), \n(5) child-demonstrated ability to communicate verbally during the \nassessment, (6) parent and child English fluency, (7) at least one parent \nor guardian willing to participate in assessments and treatment modules, \n(8) and full-time residency of both child and parent in the state of Texas \nduring the trial period. Exclusion criteria included (1) the child had a \ndiagnosis of bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, or a psychotic disorder, \n(2) the child had current and severe suicidal/homicidal ideations, (3) \nthe child was currently receiving psychotherapy for anxiety through \nanother provider, or (4) the child had started or changed dosages of \npsychotropic medications within the four weeks prior to the baseline \nassessment.\n2.2.

A research coordi -\nnator uninvolved with the study used the pseudorandom function in \nMicrosoft Excel to assign blocks of 10 participants into iCBT-Email vs. \n-Video condition. After each eligible participant was enrolled, this \nresearch coordinator was notified and they were entered into the sub-\nsequent cell. This research coordinator informed another coordinator \ndirectly involved in the study, who in turn informed families of their \ngroup assignment. In both conditions, parents were sent two links each \nweek to access the treatment modules corresponding to the week of the \nprogram they were on: one link containing parent-facing content and the \nother containing child-facing content. The child content had two ver-\nsions that varied based on the child ’s age (one for 7-10 year-olds, one for \n11-15 year-olds). All procedures were approved by the local Institu -\ntional Review Board. The study was pre-registered here: https://clinica \nltrials.gov/study/NCT05284435 .\nLearning to Understand and Navigate Anxiety (LUNA). Partici -\npants in both treatment conditions followed the LUNA program across a \n12-week period (Guzick et al., n.d.), during which families were \nencouraged to complete one treatment module per week. For this study, \ncontent was delivered using Qualtrics survey software (Qualtrics , 2020 ), \nso therapists could monitor families ’ responses and provide feedback. \nTherapists were postdoctoral fellows or doctoral students in psychology \nsupervised by a licensed psychologist experienced with this population. \nFamilies were not given access to content for subsequent weeks until \nthey completed their current module to avoid treatment burden and \noverload, though when families fell behind, they were given up to two \nmodules to complete in one week if they expressed an interest in \ncompleting additional content. The program began with three modules \non psychoeducation (Modules 1 and 2), rewards (Module 2), and coping \n(Module 3), with the rest reviewing different facets of exposure therapy. \nModule 4 focused on exposure hierarchy development, Module 5 on \ndoing exposure, Module 6 on testing expectancies through exposure, and \nModule 7 on safety behaviors and family accommodation. After these \nfirst seven core modules, parents chose between five additional sup-\nplemental modules (working on multiple exposure goals simulta -\nneously; social coaching during social anxiety exposures; modifying \nexposures for anxiety related to sensory sensitivity and insistence on \nsameness; exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic; managing opposi -\ntional behavior). Teens could access parallel modules for all these areas \nexcept for the parent coaching module on oppositional behavior, and \nchildren could access the multiple exposure goals module. A final \nmodule provided a review of material and planning for the future.\niCBT-Email. Families randomized to the iCBT-Email condition \ncompleted weekly LUNA treatment modules one at a time while \nreceiving 12 weekly check-in emails from their therapist. Therapists \nreviewed participant progress on the previous week ’s module prior to \nemailing the family to provide feedback on areas for improvement and \ntechniques for implementing program content into their everyday lives. \nEmails were generally brief and intended to be no more than a few \nsentences providing encouragement, basic feedback on modules, and/or \nchecking in on completion when content was not done on time. Tem-\nplates were generated for each email which therapists personalized to \neach family.\niCBT-Video . Families randomized to the iCBT-Video condition \ncompleted weekly LUNA treatment modules one at a time while \nreceiving both email and video support from their therapist, with six bi- \nweekly email check-ins alternating with six bi-weekly, 30-min telehealth \ncoaching calls. Parents and youth attended these visits together. During \nvideo sessions, therapists provided additional support and strategies for \nimplementing techniques learned throughout the program in addition to \nthe written feedback provided via email during the weeks families were \nnot scheduled to meet with their therapist. Content covered during video \nsessions included changes in functioning since the previous session, \nanswering questions about the previous week ’s content, offering support \nand encouragement, troubleshooting problems with the program, identifying barriers to participation if the family was not keeping up \nwith the modules, and providing feedback on CBT exercises conducted \nin the home. Consistency in therapy delivery was maintained through \ncontent checklists for each session that therapists followed as well as \nweekly supervision.\n2.3. Measures\nClinical assessments were administered to both parent and child \nacross three timepoints via secure videoconferencing: prior to treatment \n(Baseline), immediately after treatment (posttreatment), and one month \nafter treatment ended (1 Month Follow-Up). Assessments included a \nvariety of clinician-rated measures and parent/child-reported measures \nand were conducted by postdoctoral fellows or advanced doctoral \ntrainees trained as independent evaluators and supervised by a licensed \npsychologist.\nMINI-KID: The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for \nChildren and Adolescents (MINI-KID; Sheehan et al., 2010 ) is a short, \nstructured diagnostic interview used to assess DSM-5 disorders among \nyouth and has shown strong psychometric properties across both clinical \nand general populations (Duncan et al., 2018 ; Sheehan et al., 2010 ). \n18% of MINI-KIDs were re-rated by an independent rater, finding \nagreement of κ .80, indicating substantial agreement.\nPARS-A: The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale modified for Autism \n(PARS-A; Maddox et al., 2020 ) is a semi-structured interview that \nmeasures anxiety symptoms and severity in youth, which occurred over \nthe past week. It includes a symptom checklist of anxiety symptoms \nacross social anxiety, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, specific \nphobia, and panic domains and five items assessing the severity of the \nfollowing: frequency, distress, avoidance, impairment at home, and \nimpairment outside the home. The PARS-A was modified from the \noriginal Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) to better assess anxiety in \nautistic youth and shows strong test-retest reliability and convergent \nvalidity (Maddox et al., 2020 ). Consistent with our prior work, addi-\ntional checklist items were included to assess for symptoms of \nobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), in line with the study ’s concep -\ntualization of OCD as an anxiety-related disorder. 18% of PARS-A were \nre-rated by independent raters, finding an interclass correlation of .87, \nindicating a strong degree of agreement.\nCGI-I: The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) is a \nbrief, seven-item, clinician-administered measure that assesses global \nimprovement in clinical symptoms (Guy, 1976 ). Clinicians used the \nCGI-I in the present study to rate participants ’ improvement of anxiety \nsymptoms following treatment completion and treatment efficacy \noverall. The measure has shown strong psychometrics properties and \nreliability across raters (Lewin et al., 2012 ).\nCSDS: The Child Sheehan Disability Scale (C-SDS) is a brief self- and \nparent-reported measure used to determine degree of functional and \nanxiety-related impairments in children (Whiteside, 2009 ). It was \noriginally adapted from the Sheehan Disability Scale and was adminis -\ntered as both a child- (C-SDS-C) and parent- (C-SDS-P) report to deter -\nmine impairment across social, educational/occupational, and family \ndomains. The CSDS has shown strong psychometric properties, \nincluding strong internal consistency and concurrent validity \n(Whiteside, 2009 ).\nRCADS: The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; \nChorpita et al., 2000 ) is a 47-item self-report, adapted from the Spence \nChildren ’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS; Spence 1998 ), that measures anxiety \nand depressive symptoms among children and adolescents. The measure \nconsists of both child (RCADS-C) and parent (RCADS-P) self-reports and \nhas been shown to have strong psychometric properties (Chorpita et al., \n2005). The anxiety subscale was reported in this study.\nCSQ-8: The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) is a brief, \neight-item self-report measure administered to assess client satisfaction \nwith treatment services. It has shown high internal consistency (Att-\nkisson & Zwick, 1982; Nguyen el al., 1983) and was delivered as a A.G.

Statistical analysis\nData conformed to normal distribution assumptions. 16–19% of data \nwere missing on primary and secondary outcomes; when missingness \nwas assessed using Little ’s test, we failed to reject the null hypothesis \nthat data were missing completely at random, X2 (11) 7.90, p .72. \nMultiple imputation was used to estimate missing data, with the \nfollowing inputs to generate imputed models: baseline demographics \n(child age, sex), baseline symptoms scores on all primary and secondary \noutcomes, and baseline diagnoses.\nPrimary outcomes included differences in rate of change in PARS-A \nscores across the treatment period and one-month follow-up. Sample \nsize was determined to detect an effect size difference of f .39 based on \nthe pilot trial (Guzick et al., 2023 ), assuming power .90, alpha .05, \nand a correlation coefficient across timepoints of r .47 (also based on \ndata from prior work). Based on these assumptions, 27 were expected to \nbe needed in each group to yield a significant difference favoring \niCBT-Video.\nMultilevel random effects models were conducted to determine dif-\nferences in rate of change in PARS-A scores, with visits (Baseline, Post- \nTreatment, 1 Month Follow-Up) nested within participants. Analyses \nwere conducted in in SPSS v29 (IBM Corp, 2022 ). The following inde-\npendent variables were added in sequential models predicting PARS-A \nscores: 1) age (child vs. teen), 2) linear time, 3) quadratic time (to \nevaluate if the rate of change slowed between post-treatment and the \none-month follow-up period), 4) treatment group (iCBT-Video vs. \niCBT-Email), and 5) the interaction between linear time and treatment \ngroup. The magnitude of fixed effects were estimated using a marginal \nPseudo R2 (Nakagawa et al., 2017 ). Analyses were repeated for sec-\nondary outcomes, including RCADS-P, RCADS-C, CSDS-P, and CSDS-C.\nRates of treatment response (a CGI-I score of “much ” or “very much ” \nimproved), primary anxiety diagnosis remission, and remission of all \nanxiety diagnoses were compared using chi-square analyses. Completer- \nonly and intent-to-treat are both presented, with missing data being \nestimated across five imputed datasets.\nParticipant engagement was defined as the number of modules \ncompleted. Time spent per module was also presented. Differences in \nengagement were investigated by comparing the number of modules \ncompleted in iCBT-Email vs. iCBT-Video with a t-test. Association be-\ntween module completion and treatment outcome was conducted by \nincluding the number of modules completed as well as the interaction \nbetween number of modules completed and time as additional inde-\npendent variables in the multilevel models.1Assuming significant dif-\nferences between groups in treatment outcomes, as well as a significant \nassociation between module completion and treatment outcomes, a \nmediated regression was planned to investigate whether the effect of \ngroup on post-treatment PARS, RCADS-P, and RCADS-C was mediated \nby the number of modules completed\n3.Results\n3.1. Participant characteristics\nThe majority of youth in this study identified as boys (72%), White (70%), and non-Hispanic (72%). The most common diagnoses included \nsocial anxiety disorder (67%), generalized anxiety disorder (58%), and \nspecific phobia (53%). Please see Table 1for a full demographic sum-\nmary and Fig. 1for the CONSORT diagram describing participant flow. \nEnrollment occurred from August 1, 2022, to March 29, 2023, with the \nfinal follow-up assessment being completed in August 2023. Enrollment \nended once the target sample size was reached. Adverse events and \nharms were monitored using the definition adopted by the local insti-\ntutional review board (“An undesirable and unintended, although not \nnecessarily unexpected, result arising during the course of a research \nprotocol ”). No adverse events or harms were reported during the trial.\n3.2.

The only distinction in these models was that time showed a \nsignificant negative linear effect for each dependent variable in models \nwithout other covariates included, ΔR2s .070 - .137, though when \nother variables were also included in the model, they no longer showed \nstatistical significance See Table 2for model coefficients and effect sizes; \nsee Table 3for a summary of population-predicted Ms and SEs.\n3.3. Response and remission in iCBT-Email vs. iCBT-Video\nThere were no significant differences in treatment response or \nremission at post-treatment or one-month follow-up. At posttreatment, \n67% of completers in iCBT-Video and 55% of completers in iCBT-Email \nwere classified as responders. In iCBT-Video, 33% remitted from their \nprimary anxiety disorder and 21% remitted from all anxiety diagnoses. \nComparatively, in iCBT-Email, 46% of completers remitted from their \nprimary anxiety diagnosis and 32% remitted from all anxiety diagnoses. \nAt one-month follow-up, 75% of completers in iCBT-Video and 60% of \ncompleters in iCBT-Email were classified as responders. 55% of partic -\nipants in each condition remitted from their primary anxiety disorder \ndiagnosis at one-month follow-up, with 20% of iCBT-Video participants \nremitting from all anxiety diagnoses and 35% in iCBT-Email. See Table 4\nfor a summary of clinical significance data with both completer and \nintent-to-treat samples.3.4. Engagement\nThere was no significant difference between the number of parent \nmodules completed in the iCBT-Video condition, M (SD) 6.68 (3.30), \nand the iCBT-Email condition, M (SD) 5.21 (3.70), t (55) 1.34, p \n.12, d \u0000.42. There was similarly no difference between number of \nchild modules completed in the iCBT-Video condition, M (SD) 6.32 \n(3.17), and the iCBT-Email condition, M (SD) 5.10 (3.66), t (55) \n1.58, p .19, d \u0000.36.\nNumber of modules completed, as well as the interaction between \nnumber of modules completed and time, were added as additional in-\ndependent variables in models predicting treatment outcome on the \nPARS-A, RCADS-P, and RCADS-C. The interaction between number of \nmodules completed and time was a significant predictor of PARS-A \nscores, B \u0000.13, p .007, RCADS-P scores, B \u0000.33, p .024, sug-\ngesting that completing more modules corresponded with more change \nacross the trial. It was not a significant predictor of RCADS-C, however, \nB .070, p .72. See Table 5for a summary of these effects.\n3.5. Dropout and satisfaction\nEight families dropped out of the iCBT-Email condition, compared \nwith five families in the iCBT-Video condition, X2 (1) 0.77, p .38. \nRatings on client satisfaction indicated no differences across groups on \nthe Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, t (31) 1.38, d .48, p .18.\n3.6. Therapist time\nIn the iCBT-Email condition, therapists spent an average of 16.29 \nmin of therapist time per week (SD 7.11) per family, compared to \n24.13 min (SD 6.84) in the iCBT-Video condition, t (41) 3.68, d \n1.12, p D.001. Therapists in iCBT-Email spent an average of 6.70 min \nper week (SD 3.45) reviewing content, and 9.59 min per week \nproviding email feedback (SD 3.96). These numbers were similar \namong iCBT-Video therapists with time reviewing, M (SD) 6.30 \n(4.21), and average email feedback time, M (SD) 7.88 (4.64), though \nthey also had video sessions every other week, which were an average of \n27.77 min (SD 3.58).\n4.Discussion\nThis study tested two formats of parent-led, Internet-delivered CBT \nfor autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders, one involving weekly \nemail check-ins (iCBT-Email) and one that also included biweekly tel-\nehealth coaching calls (iCBT-Video). There were no significant differ -\nences in treatment outcomes across groups in evaluator-, child-, or \nparent-rated anxiety, child- and parent-reported functional impair -\nment, drop-out, or satisfaction with services. The majority of youth in \nboth iCBT-Email and iCBT-Video experienced clinically significant \nchange, with 55% and 67% being classified as treatment responders at \nthe posttreatment assessment, respectively. Primary anxiety disorder \nremission rates at posttreatment were 46% in iCBT-Email and 33% in \niCBT-Video, which increased to 55% in both conditions at 1-month \nfollow-up. All-anxiety disorder remission rates were 38% in iCBT- \nEmail and 25% in iCBT-Video (inclusive of OCD). These response and \nremission rates are generally comparable to those reported in \ntraditionally-delivered CBT for anxiety among autistic youth (Warwick \net al., 2017 ), and in digital CBT for non-autistic youth with anxiety \ndisorders (Cervin & Lundgren, 2022 ).\nThese comparable improvements across conditions were observed \nwhile using less therapist time in iCBT-Email, with 16 min/week/family \nin this condition compared with 24 min/week/family in iCBT-Video. \nAlthough this reflected a significant and large difference in statistical \nterms, its practical significance (i.e., 8 min/therapist/week) is less \ncompelling. Both conditions require far less therapist time relative to \ntraditional psychotherapy (i.e., 45–60 min weekly sessions), and are Table 2 \nMultilevel model examining change in primary and secondary outcomes across \nthe trial.\nB ap ΔR2\npseudo a\nPARS-A\nAge (Child vs. Teen modules completed) \u00001.30 .28 .012\nTime •3.74 .007 .33\nQuadratic time 0.44 .22 .011\nTreatment group .69 .59 .010\nTime X treatment group .19 .64 .001\nRCADS-Anxiety-Parent report\nAge (Child vs. Teen modules completed) \u00002.70 .41 .008\nTime \u00003.97 .14 .071b\nQuadratic time 0.70 .40 .005\nTreatment group \u00000.84 .83 .025\nTime X treatment group \u00001.75 .14 .010\nRCADS-Anxiety-Child report\nAge (Child vs. Teen modules completed) \u00005.88 .15 .021\nTime \u00002.96 .47 .070b\nQuadratic time 0.35 .73 .002\nTreatment group 1.97 .70 .017\nTime X treatment group \u00003.04 .067 .017\nCSDS-Parent report\nAge (Child vs. Teen modules completed) \u00002.90 .31 .013\nTime \u00005.29 .17 .135 b\nQuadratic time 0.83 .46 .014\nTreatment group 1.98 .53 .001\nTime X treatment group \u00001.18 .18 .004\nCSDS-Child report\nAge (Child vs. Teen modules completed) \u00003.88 .059 .044\nTime \u00003.43 .183 .137 b\nQuadratic time 0.48 .512 .011\nTreatment group 1.66 .449 .001\nTime X treatment group \u00000.65 .411 .005\nNotes: PARS Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale-modified for Autism; RCADS \nRevised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; CSDS Children ’s Sheehan \nDisability Scale.\nb ΔR2\npseudo is presented as the change in the marginal ΔR2\npseudo when each in-\ndependent variable was entered in a separate model compared to the previous \nmodel.\naB coefficients are presented for the final model with all independent vari-\nables included.\nbTime was a significant predictor in an earlier model without other inde-\npendent variables included, p D.05.A.G.

Thus, rather than \nfamilies in iCBT-Email completing more than an expected number of \nmodules, it appears the biweekly telehealth calls with a therapist for \nfamilies in the iCBT-Video condition did not engender a sufficient degree \nof supportive accountability. Given the association between content \ncompletion and improvement in anxiety, future work should continue to \nconsider novel ways to enhance engagement with CBT in self-directed \ninterventions beyond these telehealth calls (e.g., gamification for \nyouth; parental social support embedded in the application; or just-in- \nadaptive-interventions to support parents leading the program be-\ntween therapist visits). It is also worth noting non-significant associa -\ntions between content completion and youth self-reported anxiety \nimprovement. Although parent- and independent evaluator-rated out-\ncomes are generally favored in interpretation in this population, the lack \nof an association between engagement and child-reported treatment \noutcome may suggest that children ’s self-reported experience of anxiety \nwas less impacted by the degree of participation in the program. Other \nchild-specific factors or treatment processes may prove to be better \npredictors of child self-reported outcomes (e.g., intrinsic motivation, \ninsight, development of self-efficacy).\nSeveral study limitations should be noted. First, the lack of a non- \nCBT or no-human-involvement control group precludes definitive con-\nclusions about efficacy or the degree of human contact that is required to \nsupport participation in CBT content. Second, this trial was conducted in \na highly controlled setting where participants were monitored regularly, \nin consistent communication with study staff, and primarily from higher \nsocioeconomic backgrounds; it is less clear how these findings might \ngeneralize to real-world, community-based settings that serve families \nfrom more multiculturally diverse backgrounds. No fidelity assessments \nwere conducted for the intervention, an important limitation of our \nstudy and the digital interventions field more broadly. Further, this \nstudy was powered to test efficacy of iCBT-Video vs. iCBT-Email using a \nsmall pilot trial that likely overestimated the magnitude of differences \nbetween the two conditions. Given the relatively small sample size, it \nwas likely not powered to detect mechanisms, an important area for \nfuture work. The sample size also limited our ability to find significant \ndifferences in moderately-sized effects (e.g., in the client satisfaction \nquestionnaire analysis). This study was also limited by a relatively short- \nterm follow-up period.\nThis study adds to the growing literature on parent-led, Internet- \ndelivered CBT for autistic youth with anxiety disorders, finding response \nand remission rates comparable to those often reported in traditional \nCBT trials for autistic youth (Warwick et al., 2017 ). Leveraging the \ngrowing presence of technology in the mental health landscape is a clear \nway to support parents as they take on a CBT coach role. Future work \nshould seek novel ways to foster engagement with self-directed interventions to produce improved outcomes, assessing the impact of \nhuman contact (or lack thereof) on treatment outcomes in self-directed, \ndigital interventions, identify mechanisms of change, and methods to \nimplement this model of therapy on a larger scale.\nFunding\nThis work was supported by Texas Higher Education Coordinating \nBoard [grant number 22971], and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National \nInstitute of Child Health & Human Development of the National In-\nstitutes of Health [grant number P50HD103555] for use of the Clinical \nand Translational Core facilities.
