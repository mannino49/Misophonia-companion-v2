The mediating role of emotion \nregulation, anxiety and hostile attributions in the relationship between \nmisophonia and paranoia-like thoughts \nPaulina Bagrowska*, Renata Pionke-Ubych , Łukasz Gaw ęda \nExperimental Psychopathology Lab, Institute of Psychology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Stefana Jaracza 1, 00-378 Warsaw, Poland   \nARTICLE INFO  \nKeywords: \nParanoia \nParanoia-like thoughts \nMisophonia \nEmotion regulation \nAnxiety \nHostile attributions ABSTRACT  \nMisophonia is a complex syndrome in which selective auditory stimuli, such as sounds of breathing, sniffing or \neating, trigger an intense, negative emotional response. Previous studies have shown that the symptoms of \nmisophonia coexist with a number of mental disorders, such as OCD, depression and anxiety. However, still little \nis known about other mental states that may be present in this context. A total of 312 people from the non- \nclinical sample participated in an online correlational study, which aimed at investigating whether there is a \nsignificant association between misophonia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts, as well as to examine what \nfactors might underlie this potential relationship. The results revealed that misophonia positively correlates with \nparanoia-like thoughts. A serial mediation analysis showed that difficulties in regulating emotions, anxiety and \nhostile attributions are significant mediators in the relationship between misophonia and paranoia-like thoughts. \nImportantly, these mediators, above all, form a potential coherent explanatory mechanism underlying this as-\nsociation. Hence, our results highlight the important role of socio-cognitive factors in the conceptualization of \nmisophonia and its relation to paranoia-like thoughts.   \n1.Introduction \nMisophonia (“hatred of sounds ”), first described by Jastreboff and \nJastreboff (2001) , is a fairly new, complex neurophysiological and \nbehavioral syndrome (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ), where a \nrange of selective auditory stimuli (mainly sounds made by other peo-\nple) cause an intense, negative and unbearable emotional reaction in the \nindividual. In response to specific stimuli (called “triggering ” or \n“misophonic ” sounds), such as nasal (e.g., breathing, sniffing) or eating \nsounds (e.g., chewing) (Vitoratou et al., 2021 ), a person manifests a \nstrong physical (e.g., increased heart rate) (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez- \nLlort, 2021 ) and/or unpleasant emotional reaction (e.g., anger, anxiety, \ndisgust, avoidance or hatred) (Brout et al., 2018 ). Although misophonia \nis not formally classified as a psychiatric disorder as there are still \ninsufficient diagnostic criteria to formulate such a diagnosis (Ferrer- \nTorres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ), a recent review suggests that “miso-\nphonia, or some syndrome in which misophonia is a key feature, may \nrepresent a new mental disorder ” (Taylor, 2017 ). Recent studies have \nshown that misophonia is associated with reduced life quality, comor -\nbidity, high intensity of negative emotions, as well as behaviors that may affect interpersonal relationships in the long term (Claiborn et al., \n2020 ). \nIt has been hypothesized that misophonic responses are both bio-\nlogical and shaped by environmental influences (Brout et al., 2018 ). The \nexisting literature emphasizes that misophonia is activated in response \nto a specific context rather than to a given sound itself (Edelstein et al., \n2013 ). For instance, it has been shown that misophonia symptoms evoke \na more negative emotional reaction when a particular sound is made by \na family member or a close friend (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Avoiding \ntriggering situations (i.e., safety behaviors; as proven common in \nmisophonia), while initially preventing exposure and cue-related \ndistress, can often result in social withdrawal, and thus significantly \nimpact daily and interpersonal functioning (Jager et al., 2020 ). \nAlthough avoidance and escape strategies are most commonly reported \nin misophonia, approach-oriented behaviors, such as confronting others \nor adopting a hostile attitude, are also being noted (Schadegg et al., \n2021 ). A recent qualitative study found that individuals suffering from \nmisophonia perceived that other people purposely emit these triggering \nsounds “to underline their maladaptive interpersonal schemas ” (Natalini \net al., 2020 ). Moreover, it has been shown that when a person thinks \n*Corresponding author at: Institute of Psychology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Stefana Jaracza 1, 00-378 Warsaw, Poland. \nE-mail address: pbagrowska@psych.pan.pl (P.

Therefore, assigning hostile intentions to other \npeople seems not only to occur, but also to exacerbate the symptoms of \nmisophonia. \nOne of the most extreme states associated with high levels of dis-\nturbing thoughts that someone has hostile intentions and is deliberately \ntrying to hurt the person is called paranoia (Freeman et al., 2005 ). Ac-\ncording to the hierarchy of paranoia (Freeman et al., 2005 ) and the \nexisting theoretical models of delusions (Freeman et al., 2002 ), \nparanoia-like thoughts can be (among others) built on or triggered by a \nconstant stress, continual anxiety or social concerns, including feelings \nof vulnerability and worrisome thoughts that the world (or other people) \ncould be potentially dangerous. Recent studies have shown that the \npresence of a hostile attribution bias (the tendency to interpret the ac-\ntions of others as intentional and hostile rather than accidental or \nbenevolent intention) is related to paranoia and may also act as a sig-\nnificant predictor of paranoid thoughts (Buck et al., 2020 ; Combs et al., \n2007 ). While the symptoms of misophonia have been found to be \nassociated or coexisting with a number of other psychiatric disorders \nsuch as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or \neating disorders (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ), they have \nnever been, to the best of our knowledge, investigated in the context of \nparanoia-like thoughts, which are fairly common in the general popu -\nlation (Freeman et al., 2011 ). \nSince negative emotional states (including anxiety), difficulties in \nregulating emotions and assigning hostile intentions to other people turn \nout to be significant correlates of misophonia (Cassiello-Robbins et al., \n2020 ; Reid et al., 2016 ), and are also significant predictors of paranoia- \nlike thoughts (Buck et al., 2020 ; Westermann et al., 2013 ), they share a \ncommon theoretical background. As the suffering associated with the \nsymptoms of misophonia concerns the presence of selective sounds \n(often, these are everyday sounds that cannot be easily avoided without \nbeing completely isolated from other people, i.e. breathing or eating \nsounds, especially made by people in the closest environment), people \nsuffering from misophonia live in a state of constant, extreme stress \nwhich can make them feel vulnerable to harm in the long term. \nVulnerability, on the other hand, is thought to be the foundation upon \nwhich paranoia-like thoughts are built (Freeman et al., 2005 ). There -\nfore, it is crucial to examine whether these two distressing mental states \nare interrelated and to understand the potential mechanisms underlying \nthis association. \nSafety behaviors (such as avoidance or escape) undertaken to avoid \ntriggering stimuli associated with misophonia can maintain its symp -\ntoms and lead to difficulties in coping or regulating emotions over time \n(Guetta et al., 2022 ). Emotion regulation is defined by strategies and the \nability to monitor, evaluate and modify one's emotional reaction, mainly \nin terms of its intense and temporal characteristics (Thompson, 1994 ). \nDifficulties in regulating (i.e. identifying, understanding, or modulating) \nemotions, can lead, however, to many negative outcomes (Bjureberg \net al., 2016 ). Recent studies have shown that difficulties in regulating \nemotions are associated with increased symptoms of misophonia (Cas-\nsiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta et al., 2022 ). Escape or avoidance \nbehaviors, as emotion regulation or prevention strategies, in response to \ntriggering stimuli can amplify the negative emotional response and, in \nturn, lead to increased anxiety and distress. This is also in line with \nanother theoretical model in which emotion regulation plays an \nimportant role in the etiology of anxiety disorders (Cisler et al., 2010 ). \nAn elevated anxiety, on the other hand, has been found to be associated \nwith increased hostility (Hertsgaard and Light, 1984 ; Tellawi et al., \n2016 ). \nHence, the purpose of this study was to investigate, for the very first \ntime, whether there is an association between misophonia symptoms \nand paranoia-like thoughts in a non-clinical sample. In the next step, we \nintended to propose a theoretical model that could explain this potential \nrelationship and open the door to further experimental research on this phenomenon in the future. Therefore, we created and tested an \nexploratory, serial mediation model in which the relationship between \nmisophonia and paranoia-like thoughts is mediated by emotion regu-\nlation, anxiety and hostile attributions. People experiencing misophonia \nsymptoms have difficulty regulating their own negative emotions caused \nby, e.g. misophonic sounds. This, in turn, can further elevate their \nanxiety levels, leading to the attribution of hostile intentions to those \nmaking the triggering sounds (i.e. assuming they are making the sounds \non purpose). This, if left untreated and not employing adaptive coping \nstrategies, can further turn into increased levels of paranoia-like \nthoughts and a generalization of these hostile attributions by assuming \nthat other people may want to intentionally hurt them (making sounds \nthat are triggering or in another way). In this article, we will attempt to \nverify this exploratory, theoretical hypothesis. \n2.Methods \n2.1. Participants \nThe sampling method used in this study was a convenience sample. \nAs this study was part of another, larger project, it was addressed to \nadults aged 18 to 40 years, which was the main inclusion criterion \nemployed. Participants were recruited online through social media \nadvertising and the “snowball method ”. The online advertisement con-\ntained a link redirecting to the target survey, which was placed on the \nQualtrics platform. The participant's task was to answer all the survey \nquestions. A total of 312 subjects (64.7 % female) signed an online \nconsent form and took part in the online study which was approved by \nthe local ethics committee and was conducted in accordance with the \nlatest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. \n2.2. Measures \nGreen Paranoid Thoughts Scale - Revised (R-GPTS) (Freeman et al., \n2021 ) is a self-report 18 item-scale that measures the level of paranoia- \nlike thoughts (based on last month's experiences) on two subscales – \nideas of reference and ideas of persecution. The total score can range \nfrom 0 to 72, where higher scores indicate higher levels of paranoia-like \nthoughts. Cronbach's alpha for this scale in our study was 0.93. \nMisoQuest – A questionnaire for assessing decreased sound tolerance \n(Siepsiak et al., 2020a, 2020b ) is a newly developed self-report ques-\ntionnaire for measuring the severity of misophonia symptoms based on \nthe last month's experiences. It contains 14 items loaded into one factor. \nThe total score can range from 14 to 70, with higher scores indicating \nhigher levels of misophonia symptoms. A clinical cut-off point was \nproposed for 61 of 70 points. Cronbach's alpha in our study was 0.95. \nDifficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) (Gratz and Roemer, \n2004 ) measures the level of emotion regulation problems on a 36-item \nself-report scale. The total score ranges from 36 to 180, where the \nhigher scores indicate greater difficulties with emotion regulation. \nCronbach's alpha for this scale in our study was 0.96. \nThe Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) (Combs et al., \n2007 ) measures hostile social-cognitive biases. In this scale, participants \nare presented with five written vignettes that describe ambiguous social \nsituations. After each scenario, the participant is asked to complete a \nself-report scale regarding intention, blameworthiness and own anger \ntowards the person(s) in response to the given situation. Participants are \nalso asked to answer two open-ended questions about their interpreta -\ntion of the person's motives and how they would react to the situation. \nThe self-report items, when added together, form a “blame score. ” Open- \nended questions are scored by an independent scorer and form two other \nsubscales: “hostility bias” and “aggression bias”. We only use a “blame \nscore ” in our study, which has been shown to have a good internal \nconsistency among both schizophrenia patients and controls, as well as \nto be related to clinically-rated hostility and suspiciousness (Buck et al., \n2017 ). The total score can range from 5 to 80, with higher scores P. Bagrowska et al."

Statistical analyses \nStatistical analyses were performed in SPSS 27. Two tailed Pearson's \ncorrelation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships be-\ntween paranoia-like thoughts, misophonia symptoms, emotion regula -\ntion, hostile attributions and anxiety. Student's t-test was used to test \ngroup differences (participants with and without diagnosis of mental \ndisorders) in misophonia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts. The \none-way ANOVA was used to explore the differences in misophonia \nsymptoms and paranoia-like thoughts between genders. Serial media -\ntion analysis carried out using the model 6 in the PROCESS macro \n(Preacher and Hayes, 2004 ), following the bootstrapping procedure \nwith 5000 resample, was performed to investigate the mediating effect \nof emotion regulation, anxiety and hostile attributions in the relation -\nship between misophonia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts. Due to \nthe relatively high percentage of people who declared having a diagnosis \nof mental disorders in their lifetime (30.4 %), and also due to a signif -\nicantly higher proportion of women (64.7 %) than men (33.3 %) in the \nsample, both the diagnosis and gender were added as covariates to the \nmediation model. \n3.Results \nSample characteristics can be found in Table 1. A post-hoc power \nanalysis, with a sample size of 312 and alpha level set to p D0.05, was \nperformed using G*Power3 (Faul et al., 2007 ). The post hoc analysis \nrevealed a power of 0.82, indicating adequate sample power for this \nstudy. The mean value of misophonia in our sample was 30.81 (SD \n13.65), which indicates slightly lower (yet comparable) results than in \ncase of healthy subjects (M 35.32, SD 12.67) in another study using \nthe same scale (Siepsiak et al., 2022 ). \nThe results of the correlation analyses are presented in Table 2. \nSignificant correlations were found between all studied variables. \nMisophonia was positively correlated with paranoia-like thoughts (r \n0.497, p D0.001), which means that the higher the intensity of miso-\nphonia symptoms the higher the level of paranoia-like thoughts. \n3.1. Serial mediation analysis \nFig. 1 presents the results of the serial mediation analysis. The pur-\npose of this analysis was to investigate the role of difficulties in emotion \nregulation, anxiety and hostile attributions in the relationship between \nmisophonia and paranoia-like thoughts. \nThe results revealed that the standardized total effect of misophonia \non paranoia-like thoughts significantly differed from zero (β 0.504, 95 \n% CI 0.352 to 0.521, p D0.001). The direct effect of misophonia on \nparanoia-like thoughts also was significant (β 0.309, 95 % CI 0.185 \nto 0.349, p D0.001), which means that the mediation is complementary. \nThe total standardized indirect effect was significant (β 0.196, 95 % \nCI 0.135 to 0.261), with a significant serial mediation effect being \nobserved from misophonia via emotion regulation, anxiety and hostile \nattributions to paranoia-like thoughts (β 0.01, 95 % CI 0.001 to \n0.016). All the other indirect pathways from misophonia to paranoia- \nlike thoughts were also significant: via emotion regulation only (β \n0.053, 95 % CI 0.012 to 0.1), via anxiety only (β 0.041, 95 % CI \n0.01 to 0.079), via hostile attributions only (β 0.031, 95 % CI 0.01 to \n0.06), via emotion regulation and anxiety (β 0.042, 95 % CI 0.01 to Table 1 \nParticipant demographics (n 312).   \nN (%)  M (SD) Range \nSex  Age 29.17 \n(6.25) 18–40 \nFemale 202 \n(64.7) R-GPTS (paranoia) 11.21 \n(11.82) 0–69 \nMale 104 \n(33.3) Reference 7.56 \n(6.44) 0–31 \nOther 6 (1.9) Persecution 3.66 \n(6.30) 0–38 \nEducation  MisoQuest \n(misophonia) 30.81 \n(13.65) 14–69 \nPrimary 7 (2.2) DERS (emotion \nregulation) 83.99 \n(25.62) 36–151 \nVocational 1 (0.3) AIHQ (hostile \nattributions) 41.71 \n(12.16) 15–79 \nSecondary 94 \n(30.1) GAD-7 (anxiety) 7.33 \n(4.72) 0–21 \nHigher 210 \n(67.3)    \nProfessional \nsituation     \nEmployed 227 \n(72.8)    \nUnemployed 23 (7.4)    \nRetired 2 (0.6)    \nStudent 102 \n(32.7)    \nPsychiatric \ndiagnosis 95 \n(30.4)    \nAnxiety disorder 46 \n(14.7)    \nDepression 68 \n(21.8)    \nBipolar disorder 1 (0.3)    \nSchizophrenia 1 (0.3)    \nOCD 8 (2.6)    \nPersonality \ndisorder 16 (5.1)    \nEating disorder 5 (1.6)    \nSUD 1 (0.3)    \nADS 0 (0)    \nOther 17 (5.4)    \nMedication use 118 \n(37.8)    \nAntidepressants 102 \n(32.7)    \nAnti-anxiety \ndrugs 52 \n(16.7)    \nAntipsychotics 5 (1.6)    \nSleeping pills 18 (5.8)    \nMood stabilizers 17 (5.4)    \nOther 13 (4.2)    \nNote: OCD – obsessive-compulsive disorder, SUD – substance use disorder, ADS – \nalcohol dependence syndrome, R-GPTS - Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale - \nRevised, DERS – Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, AIHQ – The Ambig -\nuous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire, GAD-7 – Generalized Anxiety Disorder \n7. \nTable 2 \nCorrelational matrix (n 312).   \nR-GPTS MisoQuest DERS AIHQ \nR-GPTS -    \nMisoQuest 0.497 *** -   \nDERS 0.494 *** 0.330 *** -  \nAIHQ 0.450 *** 0.317 *** 0.445 *** - \nGAD-7 0.520 *** 0.413 *** 0.718 *** 0.433 *** \nNote: R-GPTS - Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale - Revised, DERS – Difficulties in \nEmotion Regulation Scale, AIHQ – The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Ques-\ntionnaire, GAD-7 – Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7. \n***D0.001.

The differences between \nwomen/men and people who stated their gender as “other ” were not \nsignificant. \n4.Discussion \nMisophonia has appeared in the psychological and psychiatric \nliterature only recently. Nevertheless, it has already gained enormous \ninterest from researchers in various fields. While the subject is still being \nextensively studied, much has already been established. For instance, we \nalready know that the symptoms of misophonia coexist with a number of \nother mental disorders, such as OCD, ADHD, depression or anxiety \n(Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ; Siepsiak \nand Dragan, 2019 ). However, still little is known about different mental \nconditions that may be related to misophonia severity. In this study, we \naimed to investigate whether there is an association between misopho -\nnia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts in a non-clinical sample, and if \nso, what are the possible factors underlying this relationship. \nFirst of all, in line with the results of previous studies, we show that \nthe symptoms of misophonia positively correlate with difficulties in \nemotion regulation (e.g., Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta et al., \n2022 ) and increased levels of anxiety (e.g., Siepsiak et al., 2020a, \n2020b ). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found with hostile attributions measured with a validated scale (Combs et al., \n2007 ), which is in congruence with the existing qualitative case study \ndata (Reid et al., 2016 ; Natalini et al., 2020 ) on attributing hostile in-\ntentions to people making triggering sounds by the misophonia suf-\nferers. Hence, these results highlight the important role of the cognitive- \nemotional aspects in the conceptualization of misophonia. \nWhat is particularly important and what was the main research \nquestion of our study, the results revealed that misophonia is positively \ncorrelated with paranoia-like thoughts. Moreover, we found that diffi-\nculties in regulating emotions, anxiety, and hostile attributions are not \nonly significant mediators of the relationship between misophonia and \nparanoia-like thoughts, but, most of all, form a coherent explanatory \nmechanism underlying this association. Namely, based on our findings \nwe may hypothesize that people experiencing misophonia symptoms \nhave difficulties in regulating their negative emotions caused by the \npresence of intolerable misophonic sounds. Further, due to the lack of \neffective emotion regulation strategies, these negative emotional states \nassociated with hatred sounds may be exaggerated. Indeed, the inability \nto deal with unpleasant emotions can contribute to an increase in overall \nanxiety (Cisler et al., 2010 ). The consequence of this may be adopting \ndefensive strategies in the form of hostile attitude towards people who \nmay intentionally emit the triggering sounds. Attributing hostile in-\ntentions to other people in this particular situation, which is presumably \nassociated with an elevated level of anxiety, can further develop into \nmore intense and generalized thoughts that other people may inten -\ntionally want to hurt them, e.g. emitting the triggering sounds or in \nanother threatening way. The negative emotional states associated with \nthe presence of misophonic sounds makes the person more vulnerable to \nharm, as triggers, frequently being an inseparable part of everyday so-\ncial functioning, are often inevitable. Vulnerability, in turn, is the basis \nupon which paranoia-like thoughts are built (Freeman et al., 2005 ), \nhence supporting our inference. \nNevertheless, although the directional model was tested, the data on \nwhich we built this theoretical hypothesis and our line of reasoning, is \ncorrelational, which means that no cause-and-effect conclusions can be \ndrawn. Although this model turned out to be significant, it can be \nassumed that the relationships between these variables are bidirec -\ntional, and their order in the mediation model may change and take the \nform of a feedback loop mechanism. Moreover, the results of our study \nFig. 1.Serial mediation analysis.

Our study was the very first step \ntowards better understanding the relation between misophonia and \nparanoia-like thoughts and its mechanisms. The correlational nature of \nthe study, however, can be considered as a limitation. Hence, further \nresearch, especially using experimental or longitudinal methods, which \nwould allow establishing the causality of this association, as well as \napplying structured clinical interviews, is warranted. \nOur findings also revealed significant (at the trend level) differences \nbetween the genders in the misophonia symptoms severity. In line with \nprevious studies (Erfanian et al., 2019 ; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ), \nmisophonia seemed to affect women more than men. However, the \nexisting research regarding the role of gender in misophonia is incon -\nsistent. A very recent study (Savard et al., 2022 ) revealed that miso-\nphonia did not differ between men and women, but additional analysis \nshowed that one item on the misophonia questionnaire appeared to \ndifferentiate between the sexes and referred to the physiological \ncomponent of emotions. However, it has not been proven to be specific \nto misophonia, as men and women typically differ in their self-reported \nresponses to negative emotional stimuli, which is not necessarily re-\nflected in their physiological responses (Pol˘a¯ckov ˘a ¯Solcov ˘a and La¯cev, \n2017 ). Future research aimed directly at gender differences in the \ncontext of misophonia is then needed. \nWe intended to conduct the study on a non-clinical sample, as it was \nfound that both paranoia-like thoughts (Freeman et al., 2011 ) and \nmisophonia symptoms (Wu et al., 2014 ; Kılıç et al., 2021 ) are, to some \nextent, prevalent in the general non-clinical population. However, a \nrelatively large percentage (30.4 %) of the respondents participating in \nthe study declared that they had some kind of psychiatric diagnosis in \ntheir lifetime, mainly depression (21.8 %) and anxiety (14.7 %). These \nnumbers are also in line with a very recent meta-analysis (Chekole and \nAbate, 2021 ) which showed that the prevalence of anxiety and depres -\nsion (mostly reported diagnoses in our study) is estimated at 33.59 % \nand 29.98 %, respectively. Nevertheless, the presence of the declared \ndiagnosis was added as a covariate to the mediation analysis to limit the \npotential impact of the diagnosis on the results. However, the effects \nremained significant, suggesting that both paranoia-like thoughts and \nmisophonia symptoms may appear and coexist in a healthy population, \ncontributing to elevated stress levels and becoming a risk factor for more \nsevere psychological symptoms if left untreated. \nEven though our study was conducted primarily on a non-clinical \nsample, we can cautiously assume that our results may have potential \nclinical implications. If replicated in clinical samples, moderate re-\nlationships between paranoia-like thoughts and misophonia may sug-\ngest that hatred sounds emitted by other people are a source of \nsignificant distress and exaggerated safety behaviors (e.g., social with-\ndrawal) complicating both symptoms of paranoia as well as misophonia. \nFurthermore, misophonia, as associated with interpersonal context, may \nbe additional factor increasing emotional dysregulation associated with \nparanoia. To our best knowledge, the relationship between misophonia \nand paranoia or psychosis in general, was not considered in the existing \ntherapy protocols. Although there are no proven psychological therapy \nprotocols for treating misophonia symptoms as yet, cognitive behavioral \ntherapy (CBT) is considered to be a promising and effective treatment \nfor misophonia (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ). Further \nresearch on clinical samples is warranted to explore the potential role of \nmisophonia in clinical paranoia or psychosis in general, as well as in \nrelation to other psychotic-like experiences, e.g. auditory hallucinations. \nAnother direction for future research may be to investigate sensory \ngating (brain processes engaged to selectively filter irrelevant sensory \nstimuli) as a potential common ground factor in the link between \nmisophonia and psychosis, as it has been shown that sensory gating can \nbe impaired in both syndromes (Brout et al., 2018 ; Shen et al., 2020 ). To conclude, the results of our study enriched the existing literature \nwith an additional factor playing a role in the conceptualization of \nmisophonia, i.e. paranoia-like thoughts. Moreover, we proposed an \nexploratory model that describes a potential coherent mechanism un-\nderlying the relationship between misophonia symptoms and paranoia- \nlike thoughts. Namely, we highlighted the role of difficulties in emotion \nregulation, anxiety, and hostile attributions as significant mediators, \nwhich collectively emphasize the key role of socio-cognitive factors in \nmisophonia. Hence, our findings suggest that misophonia is significantly \nrelated to interpersonal trust and at least partially cognitive and \nemotional processes play a role in shaping this relation. \nFunding sources \nThis work was supported by the SONATA BIS grant from the National \nScience Center, Poland (ŁG, 2019/34/E/HS6/00279). \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nPaulina Bagrowska: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investiga -\ntion, Formal analysis, Visualization, Project administration, Data cura-\ntion, Writing – original draft.
