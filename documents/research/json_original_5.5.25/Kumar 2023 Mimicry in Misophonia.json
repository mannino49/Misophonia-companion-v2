The\ndata provides support to the model that misophonia is not a disorder of sound-processing but rather its basis\nlies in social perception.\nKeywords\nMisophonia, Mimicry, Social cognition, Emotion Processing\nIntroduction\nMisophonia, literally `hatred of sounds', is a disorder characterized by strong negative behavioral and phys-\niological emotional responses to certain speci\fc sounds which we come across frequently in our day-to-day\nlife (Jastrebo\u000b and Jastrebo\u000b, 2001; Kumar et al., 2014; Brout et al., 2018; Swedo et al., 2022). In typical\ncases of misophonia, these `trigger sounds' tend to be sounds of eating, drinking, breathing, and chewing\nproduced by other people. The emotional response to trigger sounds includes feelings of anger, irritation,\nanxiety, and disgust accompanied by a strong urge to escape from the situation in which trigger sounds are\nproduced. Since trigger sounds are common and almost inescapable in social situations, misophonia has\ndebilitating e\u000bects on occupational, family, and social life. A person with misophonia, for example, might\nnot have a meal or share a common space with other family members, avoid using public transport for\ntravel, and will tend to avoid social situations at their workplace. This social isolation, particularly in severe\ncases of misophonia, has a high impact on mental health, and cases of suicide or suicide attempts have been\nreported in the academic literature (Siepsiak et al., 2022) and media (Nauman, 2017), with up to 20% of\npeople with misophonia indicating they have had thoughts of suicide (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). Although\nthe exact prevalence of misophonia is not known due to a lack of any comprehensive epidemiological study,\na few studies (Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017; Naylor et al., 2021) targeting speci\fc populations (i.e.,\nstudents) have reported a prevalence of anywhere between 5 and 20%.\nThe mechanism of misophonia remains largely unknown. A dominant paradigm to understand misophonia\ncurrently is the `auditory processing framework', in which misophonia is considered a disorder of sound\nprocessing (Jastrebo\u000b and Jastrebo\u000b, 2001; Jastrebo\u000b and Jastrebo\u000b, 2015). In this framework, trigger\nsounds cause aberrant processing in the auditory/emotion processing parts of the brain which subsequently\ndrives the emotional response in those with misophonia (via a currently unknown mechanism). The fact\nthat many typical trigger sounds are generated by other people, is completely ignored in the auditory\nframework, as is the fact that the context in which trigger sounds are produced is largely social, and that\npeople with misophonia can be triggered by particular individuals (e.g., close family members or someone\nfamiliar) but not by others. In other words, the current auditory-focussed model of misophonia employs a\n`detached' framework where sounds are isolated from the social context in which they typically occur. There\nis now overwhelming evidence that the brain processes social signals in a di\u000berent way to non-social signals\n(for reviews see (Adolphs, 2010; Molapour et al., 2021)). For example, brain imaging in social cognitive\nneuroscience has shown that specialized cognitive processes implemented in dedicated brain structures are\nemployed to extract socially relevant information such as faces (Kanwisher et al., 1997), voices (Belin et\nal., 2000), the body as a whole (de Gelder et al., 2010), and other `higher order' social information such as\nmental states of other people (Frith and Frith, 2006). In other words, these brain structures become active\nonly in response to sensory stimulation in social situations and they work di\u000berently or are `silent' when\n2"

This has important implications for misophonia: emphasis only on\nthe auditory/sound dimension while completely ignoring or delinking the `social' aspect of misophonia may\nhinder progress in understanding the perceptual/cognitive processes and underlying brain mechanisms.\nUsing an integrated `framework', where both trigger sounds and their social source are considered together, a\ndi\u000berent picture of misophonia emerges. Since the trigger sounds, for example someone eating/chewing, are\nassociated with an action (e.g., orofacial movement) of another person, it could be the case that misophonic\ndistress is due to the perceived action of others and not due to the sound per se, which is a by-product\nof that action. In social cognition and neuroscience, it is well known that mere observation or hearing the\nsounds of actions of other leads to `mirroring' or `mimicking' of the same actions by the perceiver without any\nintention or awareness to do so (Chartrand and van Baaren, 2009; Heyes, 2011; Chartrand and Lakin, 2013).\nThe mechanism behind mimicry is commonly understood within the framework of a `perception-action' link,\nwhich posits that perceiving the action of others automatically activates representations of that action in\nthe perceiver which, in turn, executes movements that are congruent to the perceived actions. With respect\nto brain function, the `perception-action' link is instantiated as communication between sensory areas and\nthe motor areas of the brain. With emphasis on action of the trigger-person, could it be that the perception-\naction link is relatively stronger in misophonia which is activated by the sight or sounds of action? Initial\nevidence for activation of the perception-action link and `mirroring' of actions in misophonia was provided\nby a recent study (Kumar et al., 2021) from our group. The study, using functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI), demonstrated that in the resting state, when no explicit stimuli are presented, people\nwith misophonia, who had eating/chewing sounds as their dominant triggers, show stronger connectivity\n(compared to control subjects) of auditory and visual cortex to a part of the pre-motor cortex involved in\nthe movement of orofacial muscles (movement of mouth, lip, tongue etc). An implication of the stronger\nresting state connectivity is that the orofacial motor cortex may be `primed' to respond strongly to auditory\nand visual stimulation arising from the (orofacial) actions of others. This was supported by the study showing\nthat activation of the orofacial motor cortex was stronger, speci\fcally for trigger sounds (mostly orofacial in\nnature) in misophonia.\nOne implication of the evidence from our neuroimaging data is that mimicry should be widely present in the\nmisophonia population. With respect to misophonia, there are anecdotal reports of people mimicking the\nactions of the trigger person, but the e\u000bect has not attracted much attention within misophonia research,\nexcept for a couple of case reports. In a report of two misophonia subjects (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008), one\nsubject who had eating /chewing sounds as triggers had urges to mimic the sounds by moving their lips and\nmouth. In another study, Edelstein et al. (2013) reported 6 out of 11 subjects (55%) having a tendency to\nmimic the sounds. Within the `auditory framework' mimicry is di\u000ecult to explain, whereas the social/action\nframework suggests mimicry would be present in people with misophonia.\nTo address the relation between misophonia and mimicry, we asked more than 600 participants to complete\nonline questionnaires relating to their misophonia severity and their tendency to mimic the sounds/action\nof the trigger person. More speci\fcally, we explored the following: (i) with increasing misophonia severity,\nhow likely people with misophonia are to mimic, (ii) whether the act of mimicking relates to a particular set\nof trigger sounds (i.e., social), and (iii) what e\u000bect mimicking has on individuals with misophonia. Our data\nsuggest that the tendency to mimic is associated with misophonia severity and that the act of mimicking\nprovides relief. The current data, along with results from our neuroimaging study, provide support for a\nsocial perception/cognition-based model of misophonia.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants for the study were recruited either by advertisements on internet websites/social me-\ndia platforms that served the purpose of being misophonia support groups: `sounds like misophonia'\n(https://soundslikemisophonia.com/); `Allergic to Sound' (https://allergictosound.com/), or by sending\nemails to volunteers registered with the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University (UK).

Data may be preliminary.of 816 participants took part in completing the online questionnaire. However, in guidance with exclusion\ncriteria, participants were removed from analysis if they: (i) did not give informed consent ( n = 20), (ii)\nwere under the age of 18 years ( n = 106), or (iii) if the data were duplicated ( n = 14). Data from a \fnal\ntotal of 676 participants (505 (74.7%) females, 166 (24.6%) males and 5 (0.7%) `other'/ `preferred not to\ndisclose gender') were entered into the analysis. Participants were aged between 18 and 81 years ( mean =\n38.39 years, SD = 16.10). Participants were asked if they had any other neurological/psychological disorder\nbesides misophonia, 453 (67%) reported `no', 203 (30%) reported `yes', and 20 (3%) `preferred not to say'.\nMeaning over half of the participants did not indicate having any other neurological/psychological disorders\noutside of their misophonia. An incentive was o\u000bered to participants where they could enter a prize draw to\nwin one of three £20 Amazon vouchers for their participation.\nMaterials\nA set of questionnaires using Google forms were created and an online link to these was made available\non internet websites/social media or by email. As part of a larger research program to collect behavioural\nsymptoms in people with misophonia, subjects completed a range of questionnaires designed to assess social,\nemotional, and physiological impacts of misophonia. In the current study, data from only two questionnaires,\n(i) Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) (Wu et al., 2014) and (ii) a newly developed Iowa Mimicry Questionnaire\n(IMQ), is analysed and reported.\nThe MQ consists of three parts, the \frst part being the Misophonia Symptom Scale which is designed\nto examine the speci\fc sound categories that a person with misophonia is sensitive to, for example, eating,\nrepetitive tapping and throat sounds, among others. The second part is the Misophonia Emotions Scale, which\nexamines the emotional and behavioural responses associated with misophonia symptoms. Each question in\nthese two parts is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from `Not true at all' (0) to `Always true' (4). The third\nand \fnal part is the Misophonia Severity Scale, which allows participants to provide a rating of their overall\nsensitivity to sounds on a scale from 0 to 15 (please note that the original questionnaire in Wu et al (2014),\nused a scale from 1 to 15. We included `0' in the scale to indicate `no sensitivity at all'). A brief description of\nwhat numbers from 0 to 15 is meant to represent in relation to severity was given to help inform participants\nhow to rate their sound sensitivity. For example, `0 to 3; Minimal within range of normal or very mild\nsound sensitivities (\\I spend little time resisting or being a\u000bected by my sound sensitivities. Almost no or\nno interference in daily activity\").\nThe Iowa Mimicry Questionnaire (IMQ) was used to assess prevalence of mimicry and its e\u000bect on perceived\ndistress in misophonia. The IMQ consists of a set of \fve questions which were scored on a 5-point Likert scale\nfrom `Never' (0) to `Always' (4). The \frst question (\\Do you ever start mimicking the action or sound of the\ntrigger person?\") addressed the incidence of mimicking. The remaining four questions, which were answered\nonly if the answer to the \frst question was in the a\u000ermative, assessed the automaticity/self-control over\nmimicry and the relief, if any, that arises from the act of mimicking. The IMQ is provided in Appendix 1.\nProcedure\nThis study was approved by the Newcastle University Ethics Committee. The questionnaires were constructed\nand hosted using Google Forms. An information page was \frst displayed to the participants, which briefed\nthem about what the questionnaire entailed and the necessary inclusion criteria, such as the requirement to\nbe 18 years old or above to take part in the study. Consent was then obtained via a Yes/No question. In\nconformity with data protection ethics, anonymity of personal data was maintained by a randomly assigned\nID. Participants were reminded of their right to withdraw from the study at any time and were provided\nwith the contact details (email) of the lead researcher in case of any query from them. Participants then\ncompleted the questionnaires, which comprised 64 questions in total that took approximately 20 minutes to\ncomplete. When \fnished, participants received a debrief screen thanking them for their participation and\ndirecting them to contact, if needed, the researcher via email.\nStatistical Analysis\n4"

Data may be preliminary.Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS (28.0; IBM Corp, 2017), MATLAB (version R2020a,\nMathWorks), and JASP (Version 0.16; JASP Team, 2021).\nTo assess if the severity of misophonia predicts the prevalence of mimicry, we employed binomial logistic\nregression with mimicking (yes/no) as a response variable and severity of misophonia (range 0 to 15) as the\nexplanatory variable. We also explored whether the tendency to mimic depends on any particular sound\ncategory. To assess this, we used a multivariable logistic regression with mimicking (yes/no) as a response\nvariable and the distress experienced on 7 di\u000berent sound categories (people eating, repetitive tapping,\nrustling, nasal sounds, throat sounds, consonant/vowels, environmental sounds) as explanatory variables.\nMisophonia scores for di\u000berent sound categories tend to be correlated: somebody triggered by eating sounds\ncould also be triggered by nasal/throat sounds and other related sounds as well. A multivariate analysis\nusing principal component analysis (PCA) can take into consideration the correlation among variables and\naims to \fnd common latent variable/s underlying the measured variables. We ran PCA with promax rotation\non the data consisting of 8 variables (distress on 7 sound categories and mimicry) from 676 participants.\nComponent loadings >0.5 were considered meaningful and signi\fcant.\nResults\nThe distribution of the misophonia severity scores (mean = 7, standard deviation = 2.85) in our sample of\nparticipants ( n= 676) is shown in Figure 1A.\nFigure 1B shows the distribution of di\u000berent trigger types in the current data set. Eating sounds are the\ndominant trigger type, which is consistent with previous studies (Kumar et al, 2014; Rouw and Erfanian,\n2017).\nFigure 1: A.

B.\nDistribution of di\u000berent trigger types across all participants (n = 676).\nFigure 2A shows the relation between the likelihood of mimicry and misophonia severity using univariate\nlogistic regression. The probability to mimic increased as a function of misophonia severity (X2(1,n=\n676) = 47.42, p<.001; Figure 2A). The model explained 9% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance and correctly\nclassi\fed 59.8% of cases, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.219.\nAfter con\frming the relation between mimicry and overall misophonia severity we explored whether mimick-\ning was associated with triggers of a particular type. Multivariable logistic regression was performed, with\nmimicking as a response variable and sensitivity on seven di\u000berent sound categories as explanatory variables.\nResults of this model are shown in Table 1. Overall, the model could successfully predict the outcome in 59%\nof cases (X2(1,n= 676) = 40.86, p<.001) and explained 7.8% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance. Sensitivity\nfor eating sounds was the greatest predictor of mimicry (OR = 1.341; p= .001) followed by sensitivity for\nconsonant/vowel sounds (OR = 1.154; p= 0.046).

Data may be preliminary.\nFigure 4: Response proportions for the IMQ.\nDiscussion\nExamining the largest sample of misophonia participants to date, the aim of this study was to investigate\nthe relationship between misophonia and mimicry. More speci\fcally, three questions were addressed: (i)\nrelationship between the likelihood to mimic as a function of misophonia severity, (ii) whether the act of\nmimicking was related to a particular set of trigger sound categories (as de\fned by the MQ (Wu et al.,\n2014)), and (iii) what bene\fts, if any, mimicking provided to people with misophonia (identi\fed through the\nIMQ).\nOur results show that mimicry is widely prevalent in misophonia and that its likelihood increases with\ngreater misophonia severity. This \fnding is consistent with results from a recent neuroimaging study from\nour group (Kumar et al, 2021), which for the \frst time hypothesized the role of `mirroring' the action, and\nnot the sounds per se, as the primary driving factor in misophonia. The neuroimaging study, by showing\nstronger resting state connectivity between auditory and visual cortex and the pre-motor area of the brain\nin misophonia, argued that watching or hearing action sounds (e.g., orofacial movement for eating/ chewing\nsounds) of the trigger-person results in driving the same part of the motor cortex that is involved in generating\nthe perceived action. The current study, based on self-reported measures of how people with misophonia\nrespond to and cope with triggers in daily life, provides support to the `hyper-mirroring' hypothesis of\n8"

Data may be preliminary.misophonia.\nThe phenomenon of mimicry is ubiquitous in social interactions and has been a well-researched topic in\nsocial psychology and neuroscience (Prochazkova and Kret, 2017; Arnold and Winkielman, 2020; Palagi et\nal., 2020). Mimicry can be broadly divided into two categories: intentional and spontaneous. Intentional\nmimicry (sometimes also called imitation or emulation) involves explicit intention to copy and reproduce\nsomebody else's actions. In a misophonia context, this would be the case when a person with misophonia, on\nseeing/hearing the actions (e.g., orofacial movement for eating/chewing sounds) of the trigger-person, delib-\nerately repeats the observed action. Spontaneous mimicry, on the other hand, is the automatic reproduction\nof another individual's motor movements, behaviour, or facial expression without explicit intention or aware-\nness to do so. For example, in a seminal study (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999) demonstrating spontaneous\nmimicry, a confederate manipulated her actions while interacting with participants: in di\u000berent sessions, she\neither touched her face or shook her leg while both the confederate and participants were involved in an\nirrelevant task of describing pictures to each other. Analysis of video recording of the interaction showed that\nparticipants touched their face more in the presence of a face-touching confederate and wiggled their foot\nmore in the presence of a foot-shaking confederate. Debrie\fng after the experiment showed that participants\ndid not notice any `odd' behaviour of the confederate and were not aware of their mimicking of the actions\nof the confederate implying that reproduction of the actions was implicit and unintentional. With respect\nto misophonia, spontaneous mimicry would occur if mere observation or listening to the trigger sounds of\naction automatically elicits a corresponding action (e.g., orofacial movements for eating/chewing sounds) in\na person with misophonia with them not knowing anything about it. Although not within the misophonia\ncontext, spontaneous mimicry has been shown in the domain of eating behaviour: people are more likely to\ntake a bite of food or sip of a drink when their companion does so (Larsen et al., 2010; Hermans et al., 2012;\nBell et al., 2019). Even the sounds of eating alone can elicit eating mimicry in the listener (Zin et al., 2015).\nHow does misophonia relate to mimicry? The basic premise of our argument is that misophonia is a result of\nincreased spontaneous mimicry in response to the actions (e.g., orofacial movement) of the trigger-person that\nproduce trigger sounds (e.g., eating/chewing sounds). The excessive spontaneous mimicry, which possibly\narises due to the failure of contextual modulation (either ampli\fed in excess or not suppressed enough by\nthe contextual/situational settings) is then perceived as inappropriate in terms of interfering in a person's\ncurrent goals and actions. This strong drive, initiated by an external source, to repeat the actions can be\nfelt as violating or invading personal space or can lead to a sense of loss of self-control. This is consistent\nwith people with misophonia describing their experience of trigger sounds as `invasive', `intrusive', `insulting',\n`violating' and `o\u000bensive' (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). There is also evidence that trigger sounds are perceived\nas interfering in one's current goals. In a study using a Stroop task, Daniels et al (2020) showed that people\nwith misophonia are impaired in maintaining the current goals of the task speci\fcally in the presence of\ntrigger sounds. Since perceived interference, particularly when it is attributed to another social agent, can\nbe a cause of anger (Izard, 1991), this also explains why anger, and in extreme cases, aggression could be a\ndominating emotional response in misophonia. One possible way to counter the covert drive for spontaneous\nmimicry is to overtly mimic the action of the trigger-person (e.g., orofacial movements in response to sounds\nof eating/chewing). The overt mimicry, in contrast to implicit and unintentional spontaneous mimicry,\nis intentional and done voluntarily as a coping mechanism to `cancel out' the trigger sound. The reason\nwhy overt mimicry in misophonia can `dampen' the response to the external trigger is that self-executed\nmovement alone (with or without any sound generation, e.g. orofacial movement) done in synchrony with\nexternal movements can lead to predictions about the upcoming stimulus, much like an e\u000berence copy or\ncorollary discharge making a prediction of the sensory consequences of self-generated actions (Blakemore et\nal., 2000), which is then compared with the actual stimulus and the discrepancy between the two (prediction\nerror) is processed further. The amount of dampening of the trigger stimulus would depend on how accurately\nthe self-action can predict the stimulus: the higher the accuracy of prediction, the lower the prediction error\nand thus the greater the relief provided by the overt mimicry. Moreover, the overt mimicry can provide an\nincreased sense of self-control: rather than being a `passive' recipient of the excessive drive to spontaneously\nmimic the actions of the trigger-person, the person with misophonia can now do the same action which is\n9"

This is in agreement with subjective reports of several people with misophonia who\ndescribe their act of deliberate mimicking as a means of `gaining control over the situation' (as told to the\nsenior author in personal communication/discussion).\nOur data show that the probability of mimicking increases with misophonia severity (Figure 1). When\nasked about the type of mimicry, 50.5 % (sum of `sometimes', `often' and `always', Figure 4(i)) described\ntheir mimicry to be spontaneous and out of their control. About 80% (Figure 4(ii)) of people who reported\nmimicking, described their act as deliberate and voluntarily driven. As predicted by our model, intentional\nmimicry provides relief (reported by 68%, Figure 4(iii)) and makes the person feel under control (60.4 %,\nFigure 4(iv)).\nAnalysis using multivariable logistic regression showed that, out of all the di\u000berent types of sound categories\nexamined, sensitivity to eating sounds was the strongest predictor of mimicry (Table 1 and Figure 2).\nMultivariate analysis using PCA showed that eating/nasal/throat sounds and mimicry loaded onto the same\ncomponent with high positive loadings implying a positive association between the component and these\nvariables. The eating/nasal/throat sounds are orofacial (face/mouth) sounds involving movement of orofacial\nmuscles and these sounds happen to be the dominant trigger sounds in misophonia (Schr oder et al., 2013;\nKumar et al., 2014; Jager et al., 2020). We understand there are trigger sounds which are of non-orofacial\norigins (Hansen et al., 2021) such as pen clicking, keyboard typing, and other environmental sounds. Although\nthe questionnaire did not have mention of these speci\fc sounds, it did include `environmental sounds' as one\nof the categories and no mimicking e\u000bect was observed using either logistic regression or PCA. However, this\ncategory is very broad and whether mimicking is restricted to a speci\fc example of this category needs further\ninvestigation. The questionnaire also contained a `repetitive tapping sound' which is the closest possible to\nclicking pen/keyboard typing but no mimicking e\u000bect was observed. Although we did not \fnd evidence of\nmimicking for non-orofacial sounds, the question remains open. One explanation is likely due to the under-\nrepresentation of triggers of non-orofacial origin in the current sample size given the high prevalence of\norofacial sounds as triggers. This would require a further study which balances representation of di\u000berent\ntrigger types in the sample. Interestingly, logistic regression analysis also showed consonant/vowel sounds\nsigni\fcantly correlated with mimicry. Whether these sounds trigger reaction because of the speech/linguistic\ncontent or because these sounds are mouth sounds is not clear and their relation to mimicry needs further\ninvestigation.\nWhat is the brain mechanism of excessive spontaneous mirroring in misophonia? There is evidence that a\n`mirror neuron system' (MNS) which contains `mirror-neurons' may underly mimicry in humans (Buccino\net al., 2001; Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). Mirror neurons \fre not only when the subject executes an\naction but also when the subject sees or hears the action performed by another individual, thereby creating\na `perception-action' link. In our recent study (Kumar et al., 2021), based on the \fndings of stronger coupling\nbetween auditory (and visual) cortex and orofacial motor cortex in people with misophonia, we argued for\n`hyper-mirroring' as the basis of misophonia. This means that the perception of seeing or hearing another\nindividual producing eating/chewing sounds is `mirrored' in the orofacial motor cortex to a greater degree\nin people with misophonia compared to control participants. This hyper-mirroring then reproduces the\naction which manifests as (spontaneous) mimicry. Our brain model of `hyper-mirroring' and prevalence of\nspontaneous mimicry in the current work are therefore consistent with each other.\nLimitations\nThis study used an online platform consisting of multiple questionnaires to assess misophonia. The main\nmisophonia questionnaire has been used extensively in research; however, it is not fully validated in clinical\npopulations, therefore the certainty in participants severity of symptoms lacks certainty.\nConclusion\nIn summary, our current work shows that mimicry is widely prevalent in misophonia and is elicited by the\nmost common trigger sounds of eating and chewing. These data reinforce the idea of hyper-mirroring in\nmisophonia proposed in our earlier work (Kumar et al., 2021). This idea proposed that it was the action of\n10"

By emphasizing\nthe action of another social agent and not the sounds which are only a by-product of that action, the\nhyper-mirroring model recommends that misophonia should be understood within the framework of social\nperception and cognition, and not within an auditory framework that only considers the sound and ignores\nthe social source from which it originates.
