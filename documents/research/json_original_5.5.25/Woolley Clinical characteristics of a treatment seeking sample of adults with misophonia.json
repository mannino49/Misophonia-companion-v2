Bowersa, Julie M. Petersena, Karen Mu~nozb,  \nMichael P. Twohiga\naDepartment of Psychology, Utah State University, USA\nbDepartment of Communicative Disorders and Deaf Education, Utah State University, USA\nARTICLE INFO\nKeywords:\nMisophonia\nOnset\nContextual factors\nComorbidity\nClinical sampleABSTRACT\nMisophonia is characterized by intense emotional reactions to specific repetitive sounds. The clinical charac -\nteristics and developmental course of misophonia remain underexplored, particularly in treatment-seeking \nadults. In this study, we characterized the onset, symptom progression, trigger noises, and psychiatric comor -\nbidities associated with misophonia. Additionally, we investigated the relationships between these clinical at-\ntributes and the severity of self- and clinician-rated misophonia symptoms. The sample included 60 adults with \nmisophonia enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Most participants (79%) reported symptom onset in \nchildhood and early adolescence, with symptoms often worsening over time. All participants reported being \nbothered by human produced sounds. However, responses to trigger noises vary based on the context sur-\nrounding the sound. Those who reported equivalent distress across misophonic triggers –regardless of the in-\ndividual producing the sound —endorsed significantly higher self-reported misophonia symptoms. \nApproximately half of the sample met diagnostic criteria for another psychiatric condition, with attention-deficit \nhyperactivity disorder and generalized anxiety disorder being the most prevalent. These findings underscore the \ncomplexity of misophonia and highlight the importance of considering the individual clinical histories and \ncontextual factors influencing reactions to misophonic sounds.\nMisophonia is characterized by intense emotional responses (e.g., \nanger, hatred, disgust) and physiological arousal in response to specific \nsounds (Swedo et al., 2022 ). Common misophonic trigger sounds \ninclude chewing, swallowing, breathing, or non-human produced re-\npetitive sounds such as clock ticking (Jager et al., 2020 ). Misophonia is a \nmultidisciplinary problem involving audiological and psychological \nfeatures. Current literature does not yet provide enough evidence to \nclassify misophonia strictly as a psychological, neurological, or audio -\nlogical disorder. As research continues to build, experts have agreed to \nframe misophonia as a disorder of decreased sound tolerance (Swedo \net al., 2022 ). In the interim, continued research is needed to deepen our \nknowledge of misophonia and its clinical characteristics.\nBetween 33 and 79% of the population is estimated to experience \nsome level of sensitivity to misophonia trigger sounds (Kılıç et al., 2021; \nPfeiffer et al., 2024 ). However, the prevalence of moderate to severe or \nclinically significant misophonia symptoms in population-based samples \nis currently estimated to be between 2.1% and 12.8% (Pfeiffer et al., 2024 ; Dixon et al., 2024 ; Kılıç et al., 2021). The level of functional \nimpairment due to misophonia symptoms is essential in identifying \nclinically significant cases. Functional impairment in misophonia may \nmanifest as the avoidance of going to restaurants with family or friends \nto prevent the distress associated with hearing chewing and mouth \nsounds. Individuals with misophonia who experience such functional \nimpairments report significantly higher levels of general psychopa -\nthology, including anxiety and depression, lower quality of life, and \npoorer interpersonal emotion regulation skills (Mollmann et al., 2023 ). \nGiven the complex and impairing nature of misophonia, more research \nis needed to understand and characterize its clinical presentation.\nMisophonia typically emerges in childhood and fluctuates in severity \nover time, contributing to impairment across the lifespan (Jager et al., \n2020 ). Misophonic symptoms are variable, with trigger sounds and \ncontexts significantly differing between individuals (Jager et al., 2020 ). \nSome people report that misophonic reactions are only triggered by \ncertain individuals such as their loved ones, while others report distress \n*Corresponding author. 2810 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT, 84322, USA.\nE-mail address: Mercedes.Woolley@usu.edu (M.G.

      "text": "related to sounds from any source, including strangers (Claiborn et al., \n2020 ). Research indicates that misophonia triggers produced by family \nand friends, and humans in-general, can lead to particularly intense \nmisophonic reactions (Samermit et al., 2022 ; Siepsiak et al., 2023 ).\nCowan et al. (2022) proposed that the intense reactions to \nhuman-made noises might be explained by the perceived control that \nindividuals assume others have over these triggering sounds. \nHuman-produced noises, unlike some “impersonal ” sounds (e.g., envi-\nronmental sounds or noises produced by strangers), often carry an \nexpectation of control, exacerbating emotional responses when these \nexpectations are unmet. Banker et al. (2022) found supporting evidence \nthat individuals with heightened misophonia symptoms often over-\nestimate their control in uncontrollable situations, which exacerbates \nemotional distress when their expectations are unmet. The disparity in \ncontrol perception and emotional investment may explain why miso-\nphonia symptoms are less intense with non-human sounds and un-\nderscores the role of context in misophonia-related distress. \nAdditionally, Hansen et al. (2024) demonstrated that trigger sounds can \nsignificantly influence social judgments, with misophonic participants \nrating faces paired with uncomfortable trigger sounds as less likeable. \nGaining a deeper insight into these situational (e.g., specific social \ncontexts) and heterogeneous influences on misophonic reactions is a \ncrucial step in characterizing misophonia.\nUnderstanding the psychological conditions that co-occur with \nmisophonia is also important. However, previous studies have primarily \nrelied on participants ’ self-reports of prior diagnoses to gauge comor -\nbidities (e.g., Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Few studies have employed \nstructured clinical interviews to assess the prevalence of psychiatric \ncomorbidity among individuals with misophonia. A notable exception is \na recent large-scale study of 207 adults by Rosenthal et al. (2022) , where \nresearchers conducted structured clinical interviews to examine current \nand lifetime psychiatric disorders using the structured clinical interview \nfor DSM-5 (SCID-5; First, Williams, Karg, & Spitzer, 2015a ) and the \nstructured clinical interview for DSM-5 personality disorders \n(SCID-5-PD; First, Williams, Benjamin, & Spitzer, 2015 ). Their study \nfound that approximately 57% of participants presenting with miso-\nphonia symptoms were affected by anxiety disorders, with social anxiety \ndisorder and generalized anxiety disorder being the most prevalent. \nMood disorders were the second most common comorbid conditions, \nwith nearly half of the sample diagnosed with major depressive disorder. \nSimilarly, other studies utilizing diagnostic interviews have consistently \nidentified anxiety and mood disorders as the most common psychiatric \ncomorbidities in individuals with misophonia (see Guzick et al., 2023 ; \nJager et al., 2020 ).\nMisophonia is also suspected to co-occur at high rates with neuro -\ndevelopmental disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disor -\nder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, these \ndisorders are less commonly assessed using appropriate diagnostic tools \nin misophonic samples. However, Jager et al. (2020) utilized the \nMINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus (MINI-plus) to \nassess the prevalence of ADHD and ASD in a sample of psychiatric pa-\ntients with suspected misophonia, finding prevalence rates of 5% and \n3%, respectively. Self-report studies have suggested that ADHD may \noccur in roughly 12–18% of individuals with misophonia (e.g., Rouw & \nErfanian, 2018 ). Schroder et al. (2013) hypothesized a potential overlap \nbetween ADHD and misophonia given both disorders are marked by \nchallenges in distractibility and fluctuating attention across visual and \nauditory stimuli. Supporting this hypothesis, recent neurological studies \nsupport the notion that misophonia symptoms may be associated with \ndifficulties in sustained attention (Abramovitch et al., 2024 ).\nAdditionally, misophonia has historically been suggested as a variant \nof (OCD; e.g., Schroder et al., 2013 ), but the existing data do not strongly \nsupport this association (McKay et al., 2018 ). In fact, across studies \nutilizing semi-structured diagnostic interviews, OCD has emerged as a \nrarer co-morbidity (e.g., prevalence rates between 2.8% and 8.2% \nRosenthal et al., 2022 ; Jager et al., 2020 ). Thus, the relationship between misophonia, and as previous findings have demonstrated, \nmisophonia may be more closely related to other psychiatric conditions.\nThe growing need to accurately characterize misophonia is evident, \nyet the current state of the literature remains constrained by methodo -\nlogical limitations that must be addressed as we move closer to formal \ndiagnostic classification and effective interventions. A substantial \nportion of existing research has relied on online self-report question -\nnaires and platforms like MTurk (e.g., Cusack et al., 2018 ). Although \nonline research allows for sampling from a wide range of people and \nlocations, it presents challenges in recruiting clinically representative \nsamples without face-to-face clinical interviews. Additionally, \nlarge-scale phenotyping studies that include structured clinical in-\nterviews for assessing comorbidities (e.g., Jager et al., 2020 ; Rosenthal \net al., 2022 ) often do not incorporate structured interviews to confirm \nthe inclusion of individuals with clinically elevated levels of misopho -\nnia, instead relying on participants ’ self-identification or self-report \nquestionnaire-based criteria.\nTo enhance the reliability of misophonia research, the use of semi- \nstructured interviews specifically assessing misophonia symptoms, as \nseen in recent studies (e.g., Guetta et al., 2022 ), is essential. These in-\nterviews would help ensure that clinical samples accurately represent \nindividuals with misophonia. As research on misophonia interventions \nincreases (see Rosenthal et al., 2023 ), it is crucial to approximate the \ncharacteristics of individuals who are likely to seek treatment. In-person \nresearch with self-report and clinician rated measures can provide a \nfuller picture of the clinical presentation of misophonia and provide \nutility in intervention development.\nThis study describes the clinical features of misophonia in a treat-\nment seeking sample, including the age of onset, course of the condition \nover time, characterization of triggers, and context of the triggers. We \nalso identify and describe diagnostic comorbidities. Furthermore, we \nexplore the relationships between these clinical features and the overall \nseverity of misophonia, as indicated by both participant self-reports and \nclinician assessment.\n1.Methods\n1.1. Participants\nParticipants were eligible for the study if they met the following \ncriteria: (a) 18 years of age or older, (b) seeking treatment for miso-\nphonia, and (c) met a clinical cut-off for misophonia (total score of 20 or \nhigher on the Duke Misophonia Interview; Guetta et al., 2022 ). Psy-\nchological comorbidity was not an exclusion criterion, with the excep -\ntion of psychological and/or neurological impairments that would \npreclude them from participating in the study (e.g., profound neuro -\nlogical impairment) or exceed misophonia as the primary presenting \ndifficulty (e.g., current mania).\n1.2. Procedures\nThis project is funded by (masked for review). All study procedures \nwere pre-registered on open science framework (OSF; https://osf. \nio/9mwpd/?view_only f7789c49dffe4a829cc6e504daac4bdc ) and \nClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05601284) as part of a randomized controlled \ntreatment trial for misophonia (see masked for review). All procedures \nwere approved by a University Institutional Review Board.\nParticipants were recruited from November 2022 to November 2023 \nvia local flyers and social media posts advertising treatment for miso-\nphonia on online platforms (e.g., Facebook Ads). Participants interested \nin the study were directed to an informational webpage where they \ncompleted an eligibility screener. A total of 261 individuals filled out the \nonline screener, which included the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu \net al., 2014 [see Measures section]). To be eligible for further partici -\npation, individuals needed to score above 5 (indicating at least mild \nimpairment) on the MQ severity item and confirm their interest in M.G. Woolley et al.

After the initial online screening, \n232 qualified individuals were contacted via email to schedule a clinical \ninterview to further assess eligibility. A total of 75 individuals responded \nto the email, consented to participate, and attended an intake appoint -\nment where they were given a structured interview to assess misopho -\nnia, the Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI; Guetta et al., 2022 ). \nParticipants also completed a self-report questionnaire assessing socio -\ndemographic characteristics and misophonia symptoms during the \nintake. Following the clinical interview, all participants were adminis -\ntered a comprehensive audiological assessment under the supervision of \nan audiologist as part of the larger clinical trial to identify peripheral \nhearing deficits such as hyperacusis or profound hearing loss (see \nmasked for review for more details on audiological procedures). Par-\nticipants were eligible for treatment if they met the pre-determined \ncutoff score of 20 on the DMI total score, constituting a score that fell \none standard deviation below the mean in the original validation of the \nmeasure (Guetta et al., 2022 ). Psychiatric comorbidities were diagnosed \nby a graduate student clinical assessor using a semi-structured \ninterview.\nThe final sample included 60 participants. Fifteen participants were \nexcluded from the final sample due to subclinical misophonia symptoms \n(n 9), sound sensitivities related to a trauma response (n 2), sound \nsensitivities related to the volume of the sound (n 1), current manic \nepisode (n 1), or were no longer seeking treatment for misophonia (n \n2). All participants were compensated $50 for completing the clinical \ninterview and self-report questionnaire.\n1.3. Measures\n1.3.1. Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ; Guetta \net al., 2022 )\nThe DMI is an 18-item semi-structured clinical interview designed to \nassess the presence and severity of misophonia symptoms. This instru -\nment evaluates trigger sounds, the severity of reactions, and impairment \non functioning, both currently and over the lifetime.\nParticipants begin by completing the DMI Checklist independently, \nwhich lists potential misophonic triggers and contexts that exacerbate \nreactions. The checklist aids clinicians in identifying relevant miso-\nphonic triggers. The clinician then conducts the interview, starting with \nbackground questions about the age of onset, the nature of misophonic \ntriggers (human-produced, animal-produced, or environmentally pro-\nduced), and the development of misophonia triggers and symptom \nseverity over the individual ’s lifetime. The interview also explores the \ncontext of the sounds (i.e., whether the source of the sound affects the \nreaction). Information collected from both the DMI checklist and pre- \ninterview background questions were used to assess trigger type and \ncontexts affecting misophonic reactions.\nThe DMI is structured such that each item assesses the presence of, \nfrequency and intensity, and impairment associated with a specific \nmisophonia symptom (e.g., the experience of “negative emotions ” dur-\ning a misophonic trigger [item six]). In total, the DMI yields four sum-\nmary scores: current severity, current impairment, global impairment, \nand total score. Severity of symptoms is evaluated over the past month \nusing a 5-point Likert scale, with total severity scores ranging from 0 to \n56—higher scores indicate greater frequency and distress of symptoms. \nImpairment is rated on a 3-point Likert scale for current and lifetime \ncontexts, with total scores indicating the degree of functional impair -\nment. The total DMI score aggregates all severity ratings for current \nsymptoms and global impact, ranging from 0 to 72, with higher scores \ndenoting greater overall severity and impairment.\nThe DMI has demonstrated excellent preliminary internal consis -\ntency, predictive validity, and test-retest reliability (Guetta et al., 2022 ), \nsuggesting that the DMI is a reliable and valid tool for assessing miso-\nphonia in clinical settings. The reliability of the total score (α .84) was \ngood, while the reliability for the impairment score (α .67) within an \nacceptable range.The DMI was administered to all participants by a trained doctoral \nstudent clinician. To ensure consistency, the doctoral student and the \nprincipal investigator, a licensed clinical psychologist, reviewed and \ndiscussed the scoring of the first 10 participant interviews together. This \nprocess allowed them to reach agreement on the scoring for each item. \nAfter this calibration, the same doctoral student clinician conducted and \nindependently scored the DMI for the remaining participants.\n1.3.2. Diagnostic interview for anxiety, mood, OCD, and Neuropsychiatric \ndisorders (DIAMOND; Tolin et al., 2018)\nThe DIAMOND is a structured diagnostic interview used to assess a \nwide range of DSM-5 psychiatric diagnoses, with the exception of per-\nsonality disorders, certain dissociative disorders, and certain neurolog -\nical and neurodevelopmental disorder (i.e., autism spectrum disorder). \nThe DIAMOND demonstrates good to excellent interrater and test-retest \nreliability for anxiety, mood, and obsessive-compulsive and related di-\nagnoses (Tolin et al., 2018 ). The DIAMOND was administered to par-\nticipants by a trained graduate clinician during the clinical intake.\n1.3.3. Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 )\nThe MQ is an 18-item self-report questionnaire assessing the severity \nand characteristics of misophonia. The MQ consists of three subscales: \nmisophonia symptoms (seven items), misophonia emotions and behav -\niors (10 items), and misophonia severity scale (one item). The symptom \nsubscale assesses the presence of sound sensitivities (e.g., people eating, \nrepetitive tapping) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all \ntrue) to 4 (always true). The emotions and behaviors subscale assess the \nreactions associated with misophonia symptoms (e.g., leave the envi-\nronment, become annoyed) on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from \n0 (never) to 4 (always). The total MQ score consists of the sum score \nfrom the symptoms and emotions/behaviors subscales with scores \nranging from 0 to 68; higher scores indicate more misophonia symp -\ntoms. The severity subscale consists of a single item assessing the overall \nseverity of misophonia symptoms on a scale from 1 (minimal) to 15 \n(very severe), with scores of 7 or higher indicating clinically significant \nsymptoms. The internal consistency of the MQ total in the present \nsample was acceptable (α .74).\n1.4. Data analysis\nAll analyses were performed using R software (R Core Team, 2024 ). \nBefore analysis, data was inspected and no missingness was found in the \nDMI or MQ. We employed descriptive statistics to evaluate the clinical \ncharacteristics of our sample. To explore the relationship between these \nclinical characteristics and misophonia symptom severity, we conducted \na series of linear regression models. Each model was used to indepen -\ndently investigate the influence of individual clinical characteristics on \nmisophonia symptoms, incorporating categorical predictors that divided \nthe sample into dichotomous clinical sub-groupings.\nParticipants were divided into two groups based on their symptom \ncourse; the first group included participants reporting a worsening of \nsymptoms since onset (n 38), and the second included participants \nwhose symptoms improved or remained steady (n 22). We also \ndivided the sample based on trigger type; the first group comprised in-\ndividuals exclusively bothered by human-produced sounds (n 20), and \nthe second group included those bothered by animal or environmentally \nproduced sounds in addition to human-produced sounds (n 40). \nFurthermore, we categorized participants according to whether the \nspecific person making the sound affects their misophonic reaction (n \n36) or whether their reactions generalize to all individuals (n 24). \nLastly, participants were divided based on the presence of at least one \nother psychiatric diagnosis (n 29) versus no comorbid diagnosis (n \n31).\nWe ran all four models using the MQ total score and the DMI total \nscore as dependent variables. Additionally, we used the MQ severity \nitem and the DMI impairment as dependent variables. Each model was M.G.

The results for the models run with the MQ severity \nitem and DMI impairment subscale are detailed in the supplemental \nmaterials. A post-hoc power analysis revealed that, with group sizes of \n20 and 40 participants respectively (representing the most uneven dis-\ntribution observed), we could achieve an 81% power to detect a large \neffect size of d 0.70.\n2.Results\n2.1. Sociodemographic characteristics\nDescriptive statistics were used for demographic variables and par-\nticipants primarily self-identified as White (98.3%), non-Hispanic \n(96.7%), heterosexual (76.7%), women (90.0%), with an average age \nof 33.80 years (SD 12.18); see Table 1for all participant \ndemographics.\n2.2. Misophonia symptoms\nOn average, participants reported a total score on the MQ of 38.05 \n(SD 8.13), a score reflecting that the presence of misophonic triggers and negative behavioral and emotional reactions to the triggers were \nelevated at the time of the clinical interview. Participants endorsed an \naverage score of 6.83 (SD 1.68) on the MQ severity item, approxi -\nmating the clinically significant cut-off range of 7 or higher. Average \nratings on the DMI revealed a total score was 36.90 (SD 5.51) and \nimpairment score of 14.47 (SD 3.55), indicating a heightened level of \nmisophonia symptoms and associated psychosocial impairment.\n2.3. Case history and course of symptoms\nThe majority of participants identified the onset of symptoms be-\ntween the ages of 6–10 years (n 26), followed by ages 10–13 (n 14). \nFewer participants reported the initial onset both before age 6 and be-\ntween ages 14 to 18, each constituting 13% of the sample. Notably, onset \nin the early 20s was more rare (n 4). The development of new triggers \nover time was common, with 85% (n 51) of the participants reporting \nthis occurrence. Few participants reported previously trying medica -\ntions (n 4) or some form of therapy for misophonia (n 3). Over the \nlifetime, a large portion (n 38) of the participants reported worsening \nmisophonia symptoms, 16 participants experienced no change, and few \n(n 3) observed improvements. A summary of misophonia case history \ncan be seen in Table 2.\n2.4. Triggers\nThe nature of misophonia triggers varied, with 33% (n 20) trig-\ngered by human-produced sounds and the remainder by a combination \nof human, animal, and environmental sounds. Specifically, mouth \nsounds produced through eating was the most commonly reported \ntrigger, with 97% (n 58) of participants endorsing this trigger. Eating \nsounds were closely followed by mouth sounds unrelated to eating (e.g., Table 1 \nParticipant sociodemographic characteristics (N 60).\nn Valid %\nGender Identity\nWoman 42 70.0%\nMan 14 23.3%\nNon-Binary 3 5.0%\nAgender 1 1.7%\nSexual Orientation\nAsexual 3 5.0%\nBisexual 4 6.7%\nHeterosexual/Straight 46 76.7%\nPansexual 5 8.3%\nQueer 2 3.3%\nAge, M (SD) 33.80 (12.18)\nRange 18-67\nEthnicity\nHispanic or Latino 2 3.3%\nRace and Ethnicitya​ ​\nAsian or Asian American 2 3.3%\nBlack or African American 1 1.7%\nNative South American 1 1.7%\nWhite or White American 59 98.3%\nReligion\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints 27 45.0%\nJewish 1 1.7%\nNot Religious 27 45.0%\nOther 5 8.3%\nHousehold Income ​ ​\nLess than $20,000 4 6.7%\n$20,000-$39,999 9 15.0%\n$40,000-$59,999 4 6.7%\n$60,000-$79,999 8 13.3%\n$80,000-$99,999 6 10.0%\n$100,000 or more 24 40.0% \n8.3% Unknown 5\nMarital Status\nDivorced 3 5.0%\nLiving with a partner 5 8.3%\nMarried 34 56.7%\nSingle 18 30.0%\nEmployment Status\nEmployed full-time 26 43.3%\nEmployed part-time 17 28.3%\nRetired 2 3.3%\nStudent 10 16.7%\nUnemployed 2 3.3%\nOther 2 3.3%\naCategories not mutually exclusive.Table 2 \nMisophonia clinical interview case history.\nTotal Sample n 60 \n(%)\nAge of Onset\nBefore age 6 8 (13)\nBetween ages 6 - 10 26 (43)\nBetween ages 10-13 14 (23)\nBetween ages 14-18 8 (13)\nEarly 20s 4 (0.07)\nCourse of Misophonia Symptoms Over the Lifetime\nSymptoms have become worse over time 38 (63)\nSymptoms have stayed the same over time 16 (27)\nSymptoms have improved over time 3 (0.05)\nSymptoms have become worse, but have since improved over \ntime3 (0.05)\nNew Misophonia Triggers Developed Over time\nNo 8 (13)\nYes 51 (85)\nUnsure 1 (0.02)\nTried Previous Therapy for Misophonia\nNo 57 (95)\nYes 3 (0.05)\nTreatment Received ​\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) 1 (0.02)\nIn therapy for something else, but talked about ways to \naddress misophonia1 (0.02)\nRelaxation and deep breathing 1 (0.02)\nTried Medication for Misophonia\nNo 56 (93)\nYes 6 (0.07)\nTypes of Misophonia Triggers (Endorsed during Clinical Interview)\nHuman-produced 20 (33)\nHuman- and animal-produced 14 (23)\nHuman- and environmentally produced 13 (22)\nHuman-, animal-, and environmentally produced 13 (22)\nRelevance of Context (Endorsed during Clinical Interview)\nTrigger sounds are specific to certain people or situation 36 (60)\nDoesn ’t matter who or what makes the trigger sounds 24 (40)M.G.

In contrast, non-human produced \nrepetitive noises were reported as triggers by less than half of the sample \n(n 26). Seeing a sound produced without being able to hear it (e.g., \nwatching TV with the volume off, seeing someone eating while wearing \nheadphones) was the least frequently reported trigger (n 14). The full \nsummary of trigger noises endorsed by participants can be found in \nFig. 1.\n2.5. Contextual influence\nTrigger sounds produced by known people (e.g., family, friends, \nroommates) was the most commonly reported situation exacerbating \nmisophonia distress (n 51). Forty-eight participants reported that \ncertain internal experiences (e.g., trying to focus or relax, fatigue, \nillness, physical sensations, thoughts, emotions) appeared to make \nmisophonia symptoms worse for 48 participants. Furthermore, quiet \nenvironments were identified by 42 participants as problematic. Fewer \nparticipants reported situations like noisy places (n 18) and when the \nindividual could see the trigger occurring (n 21). Notably, only 2 \nparticipants reported that context does not matter, highlighting the \nspecific situational dependency in the experience of misophonia for the \nlarge majority of participants. Fig. 2shows a full summary of specific \nsituational influences on misophonia. In the structured clinical inter-\nview, 36 participants reported that it mattered who specifically made \nthe sounds, while the other 24 reported that it did not matter who made \nthe sounds.\n2.6. Psychiatric comorbidities\nOver half of the sample (n 31) did not meet criteria for another \npsychiatric disorder. Fourteen participants met diagnostic criteria for ADHD and 10 participants met criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. \nA handful of participants met criteria for other conditions, such as social \nanxiety disorder (n 5), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (n 4), and \npersistent depressive disorder (n 4). A range of other disorders, \nincluding OCD, hoarding disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder, each \nwere reported by 2 participants. Minimal occurrences were noted for tic \ndisorder, somatic symptom disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, \npanic disorder, and bipolar II disorder (n 1 for each). See a summary of \npsychiatric comorbidity in Fig. 3.\n2.7. Associations between clinical characteristics on misophonia symptom \nseverity\nOur analysis did not reveal a significant relationship between the \nworsening of symptoms over time and greater symptom severity, as \nevidenced by the MQ and DMI total scores (p .178 and p .463, \nrespectively; see Tables 3 and 4). Similarly, being bothered by both \nhuman-produced and non-human-produced noises (e.g., environmental \nand animal sounds) did not significantly predict higher misophonia \nsymptom severity compared to disturbances caused exclusively by \nhuman-produced noises (MQ p .159; DMI p .118; see Tables 3 and \n4). Notably, a non-person-specific reaction to misophonic triggers (“it \ndoes not matter who produces the trigger sound ”) significantly predicted \nincreased MQ total scores (β 4.78, p .024), explaining 8% of the \nvariance, suggesting that a generalized response to triggers is associated \nwith higher symptom severity (see Table 4and Table S1in online sup-\nplemental materials). Conversely, having one or more psychiatric \ncomorbidities did not significantly affect misophonia severity on either \nthe MQ or DMI scales (p .837 and p .519, respectively; see Tables 3 \nand 4). These results suggest that the generalization of misophonic \ntriggers, rather than the type of triggers or progression of symptoms, \nmay play a more significant role in the severity of the condition.\nFig. 1.Reported misophonia triggers (N 60).M.G.

      "text": "3.Discussion\nThis study is one of the few studies to characterize the onset, clinical \nfeatures, and comorbid psychiatric conditions in adults seeking treat-\nment for misophonia. This study advances misophonia research in \nclinical samples by integrating structured clinical interviews with \ntraditional self-report measures, enhancing the reliability and depth of \ninsights into its clinical features.\nMost participants indicated that their misophonic symptoms first \nmanifested between the ages of 6 and 14, aligning with previous reports \nthat suggest an average onset around ages 12 to 13 (Jager et al., 2020 ; \nSchroder et al., 2017 ). The emergence of misophonia during childhood \nto early adolescence parallels the typical onset of other psychiatric \nconditions such as phobias, OCD, and tic disorders. This pattern con-\ntrasts with anxiety disorders like panic disorder and generalized anxiety \ndisorder, as well as mood disorders, which more commonly develop \nduring late adolescence to early adulthood (Kessler et al., 2007 ). This \nsuggests that the developmental trajectory of misophonia may be more \nakin to early-onset psychiatric disorders.\nMany participants (63%) endorsed their symptoms becoming more \nintense over time, a trend also reported in prior studies (Jager et al., \n2020 ; Sanchez & Silva, 2018 ). The increasing intensity corresponds with \n85% of the participants reporting that new trigger sounds develop over \ntime. Misophonia has been described as a chronic condition (e.g., Fer-\nrer-Torres & Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ), which is consistent with the report \nfrom the current sample. Further studies are needed to explore the \ncourse of misophonia symptoms to understand why the condition \nworsens for some individuals while improves for others (e.g., n 6 in the \ncurrent sample). It is important to note that no significant relationship \nwas found between the historical progression of misophonia symptoms \n(whether worsening, steady, or improving) and the severity of symp -\ntoms at the time of clinical intake. It is possible the severity of symptoms that lead individuals to sign up for treatment may be uniformly high, \nirrespective of their symptom progression history. Consequently, clin-\nical assessments at intake might focus on the current severity rather than \nhistorical changes in symptomatology.\nAll participants reported being bothered by repetitive human- \nproduced sounds. In their initial set of diagnostic criteria for misopho -\nnia, Schroder et al. (2013) suggested that the sources of misophonic \nsounds are typically human. In a large-scale study by Jager et al. (2020) , \nwhich used diagnostic screening procedures to enroll 575 individuals \nwith misophonia, it was found that 96% were specifically bothered by \nthroat and mouth sounds. These findings led the researchers to propose a \nrevised set of diagnostic criteria, suggesting that oral or nasal sounds \nmust be triggers for diagnosis. While we are not taking a position on \ndiagnostic criteria, our current study found that 97% of participants \nreported issues with eating sounds.\nOf note, roughly half of the sample was bothered by sounds from \nother sources, such as environmental noises (e.g., clock ticking) and \nanimal-made noises (e.g., licking). However, the presence of additional \nbothersome noises from these sources did not correlate with more \nintense misophonia symptoms. This outcome is somewhat unexpected, \nconsidering that the presence of more misophonic triggers might logi-\ncally provide more opportunities for triggering episodes. Human- \nproduced sounds, particularly those made by adults, are typically \nmore aversive to individuals with misophonia compared to sounds made \nby animals or babies (Jager et al., 2020 ). It may be that the triggering \neffect of human-produced noises, such as eating sounds, on individuals \nwith misophonia is so intense that adding non-human sounds, even if \nthey are bothersome, does not further increase the severity of the \nmisophonia symptoms. Still, further research is warranted given the \npreliminary nature of these findings.\nA substantial number of participants (85%) reported being triggered \nby sounds made by familiar individuals. In contrast, fewer participants \nFig. 2.Contexts that influence misophonia distress (N 60).M.G.

      "text": "(40%) reported being triggered by strangers, although situations \ninvolving strangers can still be quite distressing. Our results suggest that, \nwhen triggers are not specific to certain individuals, participants tended \nto report significantly higher misophonia severity on the MQ self-report \nmeasure. A possible explanation for the increased severity could be that \nthese individuals regard everyone as misophonic triggers, which not \nonly heightens their hypervigilance towards misophonic triggers but \nalso results in being triggered more frequently, thereby intensifying the \npresentation of misophonia. However, there was no correlation between \nthe generalization of triggers to all individuals and misophonia severity \nas measure by the DMI through clinician ratings, which may be due to \nmeasurement accuracy or reporting bias. The measurement tools for \nmisophonia, such as the MQ and the DMI, are still in the early stages of \ndevelopment. For instance, the MQ has not yet been validated in a \nclinical sample (Wu et al., 2014 ), and the DMI has only been psycho -\nmetrically assessed in one study and its factor structure remains un-\nevaluated (Guetta et al., 2022 ). As these tools improve, future \nassessments should further explore differences between individuals \nwhose triggers are specific versus those that generalize to anyone.\nWe found that a significant number of participants (80%) reported \nthat misophonia intensity can vary depending on internal factors such as \nfocus or relaxation efforts, fatigue, illness, physical sensations, time of \nday, thoughts, and emotions. Other research, including a recent study by \nGuetta et al. (2024) , has also shown that perceived generalized stress \ncan significantly impact misophonia symptoms. This is consistent with \npatterns observed in other forms of psychopathology, where internal \ncircumstances influence symptom intensity (Starr & Davila, 2012 ). In \ntreating misophonia, clinicians should consider these internal factors to \npersonalize treatment approaches. Only two participants indicated that \ntheir misophonia distress was unaffected by specific contexts, reinforc -\ning that misophonia distress is typically context specific. It was \ncommonly reported that quiet places, as opposed to loud environments, were more triggering. The fact that quiet environments are more trig-\ngering than loud ones further support the notion that misophonia is \ndistinct from other sound tolerance conditions, like hyperacusis.\nMeeting criteria for another psychiatric disorder was common in this \nsample, with nearly half of the participants diagnosed with an additional \ndisorder. These results support previous findings that the prevalence of \npsychiatric disorders is significantly higher among individuals with \nmisophonia compared to the general population (Rosenthal et al., \n2022 ). Notably, adults in this sample were most frequently diagnosed \nwith ADHD (23%), more than any other psychiatric disorder. Other \nresearch aligns with these findings, suggesting that ADHD may \ncommonly co-occur with misophonia (Abramovitch et al., 2024 ; Rouw \n& Erfanian, 2018 ). While our findings reinforce the connection between \nmisophonia and ADHD, further research is warranted considering that \nthis studied relied on clinical interviews (the DIAMOND) for diagnosis, \nas opposed to the comprehensive assessment batteries typically used to \ndiagnose ADHD.\nThe second most common comorbid condition participants met \ncriteria for was generalized anxiety disorder, affecting 17% of the \nsample. This finding aligns with the structured clinical interview results \nfrom Rosenthal et al. (2022) , who reported a 25% prevalence rate for \ngeneralized anxiety disorder. Other previous research (e.g., Guzick \net al., 2023 ; Jager et al., 2020 ), indicate that anxiety and mood disorders \noccur in approximately 9–10% of individuals with misophonia, which \nare more prevalent than conditions historically associated with miso-\nphonia, such as OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, \nrecent literature suggests that OCD and PTSD are no more prevalent in \nindividuals with misophonia than they are in the general population (e. \ng., Guetta et al., 2024 ; Jager et al., 2020 ). While features of these dis-\norders may be observed in those with misophonia (e.g., Cusack et al., \n2018 ), misophonia should not be attributed to the symptoms of OCD or \nPTSD. Instead, it should be treated as an separate disorder.\nFig. 3.Diagnostic criteria met for other psychiatric conditions (N 60).M.G. Woolley et al.

      "text": "Although literature highlights comorbidity as common in misopho -\nnia, findings on whether comorbidity is linked to a more severe pre-\nsentation of misophonia are mixed. Misophonia may be more closely \nrelated to specific comorbid disorders rather than comorbidity in gen-\neral. For instance, symptoms of other psychological conditions generally \ndo not relate to misophonia severity, except in cases involving PTSD and \npersonality disorders (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Cassiello-Robbins et al., \n2021 ). Rosenthal et al. (2022) found that the presence of OCD, panic \ndisorder, and symptoms of borderline personality disorder were signif -\nicant predictors of misophonia symptom severity. In our study, the \nlimited representation of specific psychiatric disorders within our small \nsample precluded an investigation into whether meeting diagnostic \ncriteria for a particular disorder was associated with misophonia \nseverity. Instead, we assessed whether psychiatric comorbidity alone \ncould predict greater misophonia severity, but found no significant ef-\nfect, likely due to the heterogeneity of psychiatric comorbidities in our \nsample. Future studies with larger samples should continue to investi -\ngate comorbid psychopathology in misophonia, as more insights are \nneeded to distinguish misophonia symptoms from other psychiatric \ndisorders, particularly for developing intervention strategies.\n3.1. Contributions to existing research\nAs we have alluded to, our study replicates existing research on the \nage of onset, the common worsening of symptoms over time, common \ntriggers, and frequent comorbid psychiatric disorders, but further sub-\nstantiates the previous findings through its inclusion of a treatment- \nseeking sample and use of in-person structured clinical interviews. \nNotably, we identified a new finding that has not been previously re-\nported as far as we know: the lack of person-specific sound sources —where any person could act as a trigger —might be connected \nto greater severity in misophonia. Moreover, we highlight data that \nsupport that misophonia can intensify depending on various contexts (e. \ng., quiet places, during times of stress). This finding suggests a potential \npoint of heterogeneity in how misophonia presents across individuals.\n3.2. Treatment considerations\nNuances in clinical characteristics should be carefully considered \nduring diagnosis and treatment planning. For instance, it is feasible that \nindividuals who experience distress from a broad range of human trig-\ngers, rather than specific individuals, may require different treatment \nstrategies compared to those who are affected only by the sounds pro-\nduced by select people. As a result, flexible intervention approaches, \nsuch as those already being considered (e.g., the Unified Protocol and \nProcess-Based Therapy; see Rosenthal et al., 2023 for a review of \nperson-centered psychotherapies for misophonia), are likely appropriate \nfor individuals with misophonia.\nMoreover, individuals who report that anyone could be a trigger \nsource may face greater challenges in environments where adaptations, \nsuch as noise-canceling devices or leaving a triggering situation, are not \nfeasible. Examples of such environments include classrooms, public \ntransportation (e.g., buses, trains), waiting rooms, open-plan offices, or \ncrowded events. Comprehensive and personalized treatment for in-\ndividuals with misophonia should include multidisciplinary approaches, \nsuch as cognitive and behavioral strategies, along with audiological \ninterventions like noise-canceling devices (see Bowers et al., 2024 for an \nexample). In addition, accommodations in work or classroom settings \nmay be beneficial, provided that they support adaptive functioning, such \nas enabling individuals to complete tasks like tests and work Table 3 \nCategorical regression models predicting misophonia questionnaire total score.\nModel R2β Standard \nerrorLower Upper P- \nvalue95% \nCI95% \nCI\nCourse of Symptoms\nSymptoms remained \nthe same or improved \n(reference group; \nn22)0.03 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nSymptoms became \nworse (n38)​ 2.95 2.16\u00001.38 7.28 0.178\nPerson-Specific Context\nMatters who makes \nthe sound (reference \ngroup; n36)0.08 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nDoes not matter who \nmakes the sound \n(n24)​ 4.78 2.07 0.64 8.92 0.024*\nType of Triggers Sound\nHuman-produced \nonly (reference \ngroup; n20)0.01 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nHuman-, and \nanimal-produced \nand/or \nenvironmentally \nproduced (n40)​ 0.65 0.46\u00003.28 5.68 0.159\nPsychiatric Comorbidities\nDid not meet \ndiagnostic criteria for \nanother disorder \n(reference group; \nn31)0.00 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nDiagnostic criteria \nmet for at least one \nother disorder \n(n29)​ 0.44 2.12\u00003.80 4.68 0.837\n**p D.01, *p D.05.Table 4 \nCategorical regression models predicting duke misophonia interview total score.\nModel R2 β Standard \nerrorLower Upper P- \nvalue95% \nCI95% \nCI\nCourse of Symptoms\nSymptoms remained \nthe same or \nimproved (reference \ngroup; n22)0.01 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nSymptoms became \nworse (n38)​ 1.49 2.02\u00002.55 5.53 0.463\nPerson-Specific Context\nMatters who makes \nthe sound (reference \ngroup; n36)0.00 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nDoes not matter who \nmakes the sound \n(n24)​\u00000.53 1.99\u00004.52 3.46 0.792\nType of Triggers Sound\nHuman-produced \nonly (reference \ngroup; n20)0.04 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nHuman-, and \nanimal-produced \nand/or \nenvironmentally \nproduced (n40)​ 2.35 2.03\u00000.84 7.28 0.118\nPsychiatric Comorbidities\nDid not meet \ndiagnostic criteria \nfor another disorder \n(reference group; \nn31)0.01 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​\nDiagnostic criteria \nmet for at least one \nother disorder \n(n29)​ 1.07 1.65\u00002.23 4.37 0.519\n**p D.01, *p D.05.M.G.

Resources for individuals seeking ac-\nademic and workplace accomodations are increasingly available on \nsupport and advocacy websites such as soQuiet.org .\n3.3. Limitations\nThe results of this study should be interpreted with consideration to \nits generalizability. Our participant pool was largely composed of White \nwomen residing in the Western United States. Additionally, a general \nlimitation of the extant misophonia research is that the definition of \nmisophonia lacks consensus across studies. Therefore, we urge readers \nto interpret our findings while also considering the context of our in-\nclusion criteria (a. participants must be seeking treatment for miso-\nphonia, b. endorse a minimum mild severity level on the MQ at initial \nscreening, and c. receive a score of at least 20 on the DMI total scale at \nintake).\nThe absence of inter-rater reliability limits our ability to confirm the \nconsistency and objectivity of the scoring. With only one rater, we were \nunable to compare scores across evaluators to ensure that assessments \nwere not influenced by individual biases. Although the DIAMOND has \ndemonstrated strong inter-rater reliability (Tolin et al., 2018 ), such data \nfor the DMI has not been reported despite its preliminary validation \n(Guetta et al., 2022 ). Future studies incorporating multiple raters will \nenhance the rigor of misophonia research involving structured clinical \ninterviews.\nAnother assessment limitation is the DIAMOND ’s restricted diag-\nnostic coverage, allowing assessment of only a select set of DSM-5 dis-\norders. Notably, it does not include personality disorders or ASD. \nPrevious studies have linked personality disorder symptoms, particu -\nlarly obsessive-compulsive and borderline personality disorders, with \nmisophonia (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2021 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Rosenthal \net al., 2022 ). Additionally, autistic traits are elevated in individuals with \nmisophonia, with a significant proportion scoring above the threshold \nfor clinically significant levels of these traits (Rinaldi et al., 2023 ). \nPronounced autistic traits can exacerbate the severity of both conditions \n(Ertuerk et al., 2023 ). Future research should employ comprehensive \ndiagnostic tools like the SCID-5 and SCID-5-PD for accurate assessment, \nwhich will be essential for distinguishing the unique and shared traits of \nmisophonia and developing comprehensive treatment programs.\n3.4. Conclusions and Implications for individuals and families living with \nmisophonia\nThis study advances our understanding of misophonia by detailing \nits onset, progression, triggers, context dependence, and comorbidities \nin a treatment-seeking population. Our findings provide valuable in-\nsights for providers, individuals living with misophonia, and their loved \nones. Specifically, misophonia often begins in childhood and worsens \nover time, with certain sounds triggering symptoms in context-specific \nways depending on the individual. Contrary to previous speculations, \nmisophonia does not appear to be linked to OCD or PTSD, though it may \nco-occur with other psychological issues, such as ADHD or anxiety. \nHowever, for many, misophonia develops independently, requiring its \nown distinct approach in treatment.\nWe also found that while some people are triggered by sounds made \nby specific individuals, others experience distress from sounds made by \nanyone. This distinction is crucial as it influences the severity of the \ncondition, and the strategies needed for management. For those who can \nbe triggered by anyone, broader coping strategies may be necessary to \nmanage misophonia in various settings like classrooms, offices, or public \nspaces. Recognizing that misophonia varies across individuals and may \npresent alongside different psychological conditions can help guide \nmore effective, personalized treatment plans. Researchers should focus \non refining diagnostic criteria in clinical samples and developing tar-\ngeted interventions that consider the unique triggers and experiences of \nindividuals with misophonia.CRediT authorship contribution statement\nMercedes G.
