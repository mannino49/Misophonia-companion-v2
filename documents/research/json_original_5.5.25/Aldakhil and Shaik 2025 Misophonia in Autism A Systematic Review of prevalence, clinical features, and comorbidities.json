      "text": "Misophonia in autism: A systematic review of prevalence, clinical \nfeatures, and comorbidities\nAli Fahad Aldakhila,1,*, Riyaz Ahamed Shaikb,2\naDepartment of Special Education, College of Education, Majmaah University, Majmaah 11952, Saudi Arabia\nbDepartment of Family and Community Medicine, College of medicine Majmaah University, Majmaah 11952, Saudi Arabia\nARTICLE INFO\nKeywords:\nMisophonia\nAutism spectrum disorder\nSensory sensitivity\nPsychiatric comorbidities\nPrevalence\nTreatmentABSTRACT\nBackground: Misophonia, characterized by intense emotional reactions to specific sounds, is \nincreasingly studied in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related mental health conditions such \nas obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and depression. Autistic individuals often have \nsensory sensitivities, which may predispose them to misophonia. However, the relationship be-\ntween misophonia, sensory sensitivities, and psychiatric comorbidities in autism remains \nunderexplored.\nAims: This systematic review examines the prevalence, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and \ntreatment outcomes of misophonia in autistic individuals and related conditions. It also explores \nthe neurobiological links between misophonia and sensory sensitivities and their impact on \nquality of life, aiming to inform diagnostic and intervention strategies.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted across seven databases following PRISMA guidelines. \nStudies assessing misophonia in autism, using established diagnostic criteria, were included. The \nrisk of bias was evaluated using ROBINS-I, AXIS, Venice criteria, and JBI tools.\nResults: Fourteen studies (n 89,889 participants) met inclusion criteria. Misophonia prevalence \nin autism ranged from 12.8 % to 35.5 %, with 79 % of autistic individuals with misophonia also \nexperiencing psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety, OCD, and depression. Clinical charac -\nteristics included intense emotional reactions to specific sound triggers (e.g., eating, breathing) \nand significant disruptions in daily functioning. Sensory sensitivities were reported in 21.4 % of \ncases, highlighting the overlap between misophonia and broader sensory processing challenges in \nautism. There were only two intervention studies: one demonstrating the efficacy of risperidone \nin reducing misophonia severity, and another suggesting cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and \ntinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) as potential management strategies. Quality assessment \nrevealed varying levels of bias, particularly in observational studies, which often lacked robust \nrandomization and blinding.\nConclusion: Misophonia is prevalent in autism and frequently co-occurs with psychiatric condi -\ntions and sensory hypersensitivities. Standardized diagnostic tools and tailored interventions are \nneeded to improve clinical outcomes. Future research should explore longitudinal trajectories, \ngenetic and environmental influences, and effective management strategies to address the com-\nplex interplay between misophonia, sensory sensitivities, and autism.\n*Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: af.aldakhil@mu.edu.sa (A.F.

      "text": "1.What this study adds\nThis study advances the understanding of misophonia by clarifying its relationship with autism and sensory sensitivities, dis-\ntinguishing it as a discrete sensory condition rather than a mere comorbid feature. It highlights genetic predispositions and envi-\nronmental influences, such as maternal mental health, as contributing factors to misophonia ’s development. The review also \nunderscores psychiatric comorbidities associated with misophonia, including anxiety, depression, OCD, and ADHD, emphasizing its \nimpact on quality of life. While behavioral and pharmacological interventions show promise, there are limitations such as small sample \nsizes and methodological constraints, calling for larger, well-controlled studies. By advocating for a multidisciplinary approach \nintegrating sensory, psychiatric, and environmental perspectives, this study contributes to refining diagnostic protocols, improving \nintervention strategies, and fostering a deeper understanding of misophonia within neurodevelopmental and psychiatric frameworks.\n2.Introduction\nAtypical sensory processing is a hallmark of autism, characterized by hyperreactivity or hyporeactivity to sensory stimuli across \nmodalities such as sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, and the vestibular and proprioceptive systems (Morimoto & Miller, 2021 ). Research \nindicates that up to 90 % of autistic individuals experience sensory processing difficulties, most commonly in the auditory, tactile, and \nvisual domains, with auditory hypersensitivity being particularly prevalent (Balasco et al., 2020 ). This heightened sensitivity to sound \noften triggers negative emotional responses such as anxiety and avoidance behaviors in noisy environments significantly impairing \ndaily functioning and quality of life (Donkers et al., 2020; Schwemmle & Arens, 2022 ).\nAuditory hypersensitivity, a common sensory challenge in autism, manifests in diverse ways, with one particularly distressing form \nbeing misophonia, a condition characterized by extreme emotional responses to specific, repetitive sounds like chewing, breathing, or \ntapping (Hansen et al., 2022 ), reflecting a complex neurophysiological and behavioral disorder with heightened physiological re-\nactions, as noted by Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2002) and Wu et al. (2014) . The term, derived from the Greek \"misos \" (hatred) and \n\"phonos \" (sound), was introduced in audiology literature as a \"hatred of sounds\" (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002 ), with Siepsiak and \nDragan (2019) emphasizing its selective aversion and hyper-reactivity to such triggers, often leading to anger, disgust, or fear (Banker \net al., 2022 ) and significant disruptions in daily life, including social withdrawal and anxiety (Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). First described in \nthe early 2000s (Schroder et al., 2013 ), misophonia was distinguished from hyperacusis and phonophobia by Edelstein et al. (2013) , \nwho provided early physiological insights, paving the way for the Amsterdam University Medical Centers (AMC) to propose the first \npsychiatric diagnostic criteria in 2013 (Schroder et al., 2013 ). This perspective, suggesting misophonia as a new mental disorder \n(Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2021; Daniels et al., 2020 ), has fueled extensive research (e.g., Brout et al., 2018 ; Ferrer-Torres & \nGim˘enez-Llort, 2021 ), though Taylor (2017) highlights an ongoing debate about whether it is primarily auditory or psychiatric, given \nits lack of consistent ties to hearing thresholds across individuals with normal hearing, hearing loss, or auditory pathology (see Møller, \n2011 ), and the specificity of triggers suggesting non-auditory origins (see Duddy & Oeding, 2014 ).\nTypically emerging in childhood or adolescence, misophonia persists as a chronic condition (Pan et al., 2022 ), with approximately \n69 % of affected individuals also reporting hyperacusis, amplifying sensory distress (Jager et al., 2020 ). Although not yet classified in \nthe DSM-5-TR or ICD-11, recent neurobiological research indicates significant overlaps between misophonia and autism, particularly \nin brain regions linked to auditory processing, emotional regulation, and salience detection (Aazh et al., 2018; Eijsker et al., 2021; \nGreenberg et al., 2023; Guzick et al., 2023 ). Studies suggest a higher prevalence of misophonia among autistic individuals compared to \nthe general population (Smith et al., 2022; Williams et al., 2021 ), with 3.6 % of adults self-reporting misophonia also diagnosed with \nautism —a rate exceeding the estimated 1–2 % prevalence broadly (Williams et al., 2021 ).\nEfforts to formalize misophonia ’s diagnostic criteria continue, supported by tools like the Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening \nQuestionnaire (Williams et al., 2022 ) and the Misophonia Symptom Checklist (Vitoratou et al., 2023 ), which enhance diagnostic \nreliability in the general population and may be applicable to autistic individuals. Research also highlights overlap with \nobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism spectrum disorder (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2024; Jager et al., 2020 ), suggesting \nshared sensory and emotional processing challenges. Neuroimaging reveals hyperactivity in the anterior insular cortex a hub for \nsalience detection and emotional processing, in individuals with misophonia (Kumar et al., 2017 ), supporting its classification as an \nauditory-emotional processing disorder rather than a simple sensory sensitivity (Brout et al., 2018 ). Genetic studies hint at hereditary \nsusceptibility (Smit et al., 2023 ), and sensory sensitivity appears a prerequisite, with no cases reported absent auditory processing \ndifferences (Andermane et al., 2023; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ).\nAlthough misophonia, hyperacusis, and auditory processing disorder (APD) all involve atypical auditory responses, they are \ndistinct conditions with unique characteristics. Hyperacusis refers to an increased sensitivity to loudness, where moderate or even soft \nsounds are perceived as intolerably loud or painful (Scheerer et al., 2024 ). Misophonia, on the other hand, is a selective hypersen -\nsitivity to specific repetitive sounds such as chewing, breathing, or tapping, often triggering emotional distress rather than physical \ndiscomfort (Williams et al., 2022 ). In contrast, APD is not necessarily about sensitivity to sound but rather difficulties in processing and \ninterpreting auditory information correctly, leading to challenges in speech comprehension, especially in noisy environments (Carson \net al., 2024; Guzick et al., 2023 ). While autistic individuals may experience one or more of these conditions, they do not always \nco-occur, and their underlying mechanisms remain distinct.\nDespite growing recognition of misophonia as an independent sensory condition, its relationship with autism and comorbid mental \nhealth conditions remains underexplored. Unlike hyperacusis, which causes general sound intolerance, misophonia involves intense \nreactions to specific triggers. This distinction raises questions about whether misophonia is a unique condition or part of a broader \nsensory processing profile in autism, including tinnitus and auditory processing difficulties (Smit et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2021 ).

      "text": "Autistic individuals, often exhibiting heightened auditory sensitivity (Balasco et al., 2020 ; Morimoto & Miller, 2021 ), may be pre-\ndisposed to misophonia, yet the precise intersections remain unexamined.\n2.1. Aim of the review\nThis review aims to synthesize the current literature on misophonia’s prevalence, clinical characteristics, and neurobiological links \nto sensory sensitivities in autism, as well as their impact on quality of life, while highlighting promising interventions to inform \nimproved diagnostic and management strategies for this population. It provides a distinct focus compared to prior work, such as the \nreview by Williams et al. (2021) , which examined misophonia in general populations, by concentrating on prevalence, clinical \ncharacteristics, psychiatric comorbidities, and treatment outcomes specifically among autistic individuals.\nThis review investigates the specific intersection of misophonia and sensory sensitivity within the autism population and related \ndisorders. Specifically, it explores (a) prevalence of misophonia in autistic individuals, (b) clinical characteristics and comorbidities \nassociated with misophonia in autism and related mental health conditions known to affect misophonia and which are often seen in \nautism (e.g., anxiety disorders, depression, OCD), (c) potential shared neurobiological mechanisms underlying sensory sensitivities \nand misophonia, and (d) implications of these findings for diagnosis and intervention.\nGiven the limited number of studies directly addressing misophonia in autism, a more systematic analysis of existing evidence is \nessential to advance understanding and guide future research and clinical practice. This review extends the literature by delving into \nthe connection between misophonia and sensory sensitivity in autism. It highlights the importance of distinguishing misophonia as a \npotential diagnostic consideration within autism and underscores the need for targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to address \nits impact on daily functioning and quality of life.\n3.Methodology\n3.1. Design and procedure\nThis systematic review was developed using the PECOS framework (Population, Exposure, Comparison, Outcomes, Study Design) \nin accordance with the PRISMA reporting guidelines (Page et al., 2021 ). Studies were considered that involve autistic individuals based \non established diagnostic tools or criteria (e.g., DSM-5 or ICD-11). Studies that included individuals with comorbid mental health \nconditions (e.g., anxiety disorders, depression, OCD) were eligible if they also included autistic participants. The exposure included \nclinical assessments and questionnaire-based evaluations of misophonia. As the primary focus of this review was on the prevalence, \nclinical characteristics, and correlates of misophonia in autism, no formal comparisons (i.e., between autistic individuals and those \nwithout autism) were mandatory for inclusion.\n3.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nTo ensure consistency and rigor in the study selection process, the screening was conducted by two researchers (first and second \nauthors). Both participated in preparatory sessions to familiarize themselves with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, supported by \ndetailed guidelines.\n3.2.1. Inclusion criteria\nThe studies to be included had to meet the following criteria: (a) Participants were autistic individuals based on established \ndiagnostic tools or criteria (e.g., DSM-5 or ICD-11). Studies that included individuals with comorbid mental health conditions (e.g., \nanxiety disorders, depression, OCD) were eligible if some of the participants were autistic. (b) Misophonia was assessed using \nrecognized diagnostic tools, symptom scales, or clinical frameworks. While misophonia is not yet classified in the DSM-5 or ICD-11, it \nhad to be operationally defined in the study through specific clinical frameworks or validated symptom scales. (c) Data were reported \non the prevalence, severity, clinical characteristics, or correlates of misophonia in autistic individuals. This included studies exploring \nthe relationship between misophonia and sensory sensitivities, psychiatric comorbidities, and/or quality of life in autistic individuals. \nOnly studies that provided relevant quantitative or qualitative data and were published in English were considered for inclusion, with \nno restrictions on the year of publication. The review included interventional, observational, cross-sectional, and genome-wide as-\nsociation studies (GWAS), as these designs are particularly effective for identifying population-based prevalence rates and exploring \ncorrelation patterns.\n3.2.2. Exclusion criteria\nThe review excluded the following: (a) review articles, opinion pieces, and editorials; (b) studies that did not directly assess \nmisophonia through recognized diagnostic tools, symptom scales, or clinical frameworks (i.e., studies that only mentioned misophonia \nin passing or did not provide specific data or evaluations on the condition); and (c) studies published in a language other than English.\n3.3. Search strategy\nThe search was conducted across seven databases using Boolean operators and MeSH terms to ensure comprehensive coverage. The \ndatabases included PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Variants of terms and A.F. Aldakhil and R.A.

Study selection and interrater agreement\nA total of 308 records were identified across the databases. After removing 41 duplicates, 267 records remained for screening. \nDuring this phase, 29 records were excluded due to the unavailability of full texts. Among the 238 remaining reports, 34 could not be \nretrieved despite multiple requests to the author(s). For the eligibility assessment, 189 reports were excluded for the following reasons: \n30 did not meet the PICO criteria, 28 were off-topic, 26 had different study objectives, 43 were scoping reviews, 33 were literature \nreviews, and 30 were Ph.D. theses. Ultimately, 204 reports were evaluated for eligibility, with 14 studies included in the final analysis \n(see Fig. 1).\nThe two authors independently screened a random sample of 50 studies based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (see \n2.2). The level of agreement between the reviewers was calculated using Cohen ’s Kappa, a statistical method that accounts for chance \nagreement. The interrater reliability for study selection yielded a Kappa value of 0.82, indicating excellent agreement.\n3.5. Data extraction\nTwo trained researchers (first and second authors) systematically and independently extracted data from the included studies. A \ntrained external reviewer provided additional support in verifying the data extraction process. In cases of disagreement between the \ntwo primary researchers, the first author served as an adjudicator to resolve conflicts.\nThe data extracted included study characteristics (e.g., title, first author, publication year, country, and study design), sampling \nstrategies, diagnostic tools and criteria used for autism and misophonia, sample sizes, prevalence rates of misophonia in autistic \npopulations, severity levels, specific triggers eliciting misophonia, and any reported psychiatric comorbidities or sensory processing \ndifferences.\n4.Results\n4.1. Study characteristics\nThis systematic review synthesizes findings from 14 studies examining the intersection of sensory sensitivity, misophonia, and \nautism or other mental health conditions. A summary of the characteristics of the included studies is presented in Table 2. These studies \nutilized diverse methodologies, populations, and outcomes. A total of 89,889 participants were included across the 14 studies, rep-\nresenting a broad range of ages, diagnostic profiles, and geographical contexts. Participant ages ranged from 3 to 88 years, with in-\ndividual studies focusing on specific age groups. For instance, Costa et al. (2022) examined children aged 26–62 months, Herdi and \nYıldırım (2023) focused on adolescents aged 12–18 years, and Scheerer et al. (2024) studied adults aged 19 years and older.\nGender differences\nGender representation varied substantially across studies. Females predominated in certain samples, such as 92% of the sample of \nadults with misophonia in Rinaldi et al. (2023) . Other studies reported more balanced gender distributions, with slightly over 50% \nfemale representation in Scheerer et al. (2024) and Williams et al. (2022) . Some studies also included non-binary individuals or did not \nspecify gender distributions, highlighting the diverse demographic contexts represented in the reviewed research.\nAlso, the diagnostic profiles of the participants varied substantially across the included studies.

Cultural and country specific differences\nGeographically, the studies were conducted in a range of countries, providing a broad cultural and clinical perspective. These \nincluded the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Netherlands, Brazil, Kuwait, and Poland. Sample sizes varied widely, ranging \nfrom large-scale genome-wide association studies, such as Smit et al. (2023) with 80,607 participants, to small-scale interventions.\n4.3. Prevalence of misophonia and its correlates in autism\nMisophonia is increasingly recognized as a prevalent condition, with its occurrence varying across different populations. In this \nsystematic review, the prevalence of misophonia among autistic individuals varied across studies and demographic groups, but \ngenerally demonstrating a notable overlap between the two conditions. For autistic adults, clinically significant misophonia symptoms \nwere reported in 30%–35.5 % of participants, as identified using validated tools like the Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening \nQuestionnaire (DVMSQ) (Scheerer et al., 2024; Williams et al., 2022 ). Scheerer et al. (2024) reported that 30% of autistic adults \nexperienced clinically significant misophonia compared to 13% of non-autistic adults. In autistic participants, misophonia was \nstrongly associated with elevated anxiety and depression levels and poorer quality of life, underscoring its broader psychological \nimpact (Scheerer et al., 2024 ). Among autistic children, broader auditory sensory over-responsivity, which includes misophonia, \nhyperacusis, and phonophobia was observed in 60%–70 % of the cases, indicating the high prevalence of sensory processing chal-\nlenges in this population (Carson et al., 2024 ). Furthermore, greater misophonia severity was linked to poorer quality of life (see Jager \net al., 2020 ). Additionally, among individuals with other mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive \ndisorder (OCD), misophonia prevalence appears elevated, with studies reporting high comorbidity rates (e.g., 45% of youth with \nmisophonia also diagnosed with anxiety or OCD; Guzick et al., 2023 ), though specific prevalence estimates independent of autism \nFig. 1.Article selection process representation of the review using the PRISMA protocol.A.F.

      "text": "remain less consistently documented in this review (see Section 3.5for further details).\n4.4. Clinical characteristics and triggers of misophonia\nAmong the included studies, misophonia is characterized by intense emotional reactions to specific sound triggers, which disrupt \ndaily functioning and quality of life. Guzick et al. (2023) reported that among youth with misophonia, common triggers included \neating sounds (96%), breathing (84%), and throat sounds (66%). Emotional responses were predominantly anger (95%) and distress \n(93%), leading to a profound impact on family dynamics (Guzick et al., 2023 ). Similarly, Siepsiak et al. (2023) identified oral sounds \nas the most common triggers among both children with misophonia (68% female) and controls. Younger children often responded \nwith aggression, while older children displayed self-harm behaviors, further illustrating the developmental variation in misophonia ’s \nmanifestations (Siepsiak et al., 2023 ). Specifically in autistic individuals, misophonia often involves heightened emotional responses \nsuch as anger or distress to auditory triggers, as well as associated behavioral patterns like avoidance or agitation.\n4.5. Sensory sensitivities in autism and misophonia\nSensory sensitivities, including heightened responses to auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli, are hallmark features of autism and are \nalso commonly observed in individuals with misophonia. Evidence suggests a notable overlap between misophonia and autistic traits. \nThe study by Rinaldi et al. (2023) found that adults with misophonia scored higher on subscales measuring autistic traits, with 21.4 % \nmeeting the clinical threshold for autism compared to 2.8% of controls. Similar results were found in children with misophonia. These \nfindings highlight a possible intersection between the two conditions, particularly in terms of sensory sensitivities.\nNeurobiological and behavioral parallels between autism and misophonia suggest shared underlying mechanisms. Hyper -\nconnectivity in sensory cortices and heightened amygdala activity, both observed in autism and misophonia, may account for the \npronounced hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli (Castro et al., 2013; Green & Ben-Sasson, 2010; Kumar et al., 2017; Marco et al., 2011 ). \nHowever, Rinaldi et al. (2023) emphasize that while individuals with misophonia may display elevated autistic traits, their sensory \nprofiles are distinct, with a disproportionate focus on auditory stimuli compared to the broader sensory sensitivities characteristic of \nautism. This distinction raises critical questions about whether misophonia represents a discrete condition or reflects variations in \nsensory processing along a continuum associated with autism.\n4.6. Psychiatric comorbidities in misophonia\nPsychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals with misophonia, complicating its clinical profile and management. \nGuzick et al. (2023) reported that 79% of youth with misophonia met the diagnostic criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder. \nAmong these, 47% were diagnosed with major depressive disorder, 45% with anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), \nand/or 21% with ADHD, rates that appear notably higher than in youth without misophonia. Similarly, Jager et al. (2020) docu-\nmented elevated rates of psychiatric comorbidities in a clinical sample of individuals with misophonia. These included \nobsessive-compulsive personality traits (26%), mood disorders (10%), and ADHD (5%).\n4.7. Interventions for misophonia\nThe number of studies examining interventions for misophonia was limited; only two intervention studies were identified: Pan et al. \n(2022) , a single-case study examining the use of risperidone to treat severe misophonia in a 32-year-old autistic male, showing a \nsignificant reduction in AMISOS-R score from 31 (severe) to 5 (subclinical) after titration to 2mg twice daily, and Swonke et al. (2025) , \na case series describing two pediatric cases (ages 3 and 16) that outlines cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and tinnitus retraining \ntherapy (TRT) as management approaches, though it does not provide detailed quantitative outcomes for symptom reduction.Table 2 (continued )\nAuthor(s), year, \ncountry Aim Sample Size Age (range, mean) Gender Distribution Findings\n≡Misophonia was associated \nwith lower life satisfaction, \ngreater anxiety, depression, \nanger, and somatic symptom \nburden.\nUtility of the DVMSQ: \n≡The DVMSQ serves as a \nreliable screening and \ndiagnostic tool for research \nand clinical applications to \nidentify misophonia and \nassess symptom severity.A.F.

      "text": "4.8. Genetic and environmental factors of misophonia\nEmerging evidence suggests a genetic basis for misophonia. For example, Smith et al. (2023) found significant genetic correlations \nbetween misophonia and traits such as neuroticism (rG 0.42) and irritability. They also observed a negative genetic correlation with \neducational attainment, suggesting that genetic factors associated with misophonia may inversely influence traits related to academic \nor cognitive performance. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic predispositions and behavioural traits in \nunderstanding misophonia. Additionally, environmental factors, including maternal mental health, may play a potential role in the \ndevelopment of misophonia. Siepsiak et al. (2023) found significantly higher rates of maternal postpartum depression among mothers \nof children with misophonia (20.5 %) compared to control groups (2.7%). This finding may point to the influence of early envi-\nronmental and familial factors in shaping the risk of developing misophonia.\n4.9. Quality assessment protocol\nThe quality of the included studies was assessed using a comprehensive, design-specific approach. Four categories of study designs \nwere evaluated as follows: (a) observational studies were evaluated using the ROBINS-I tool (Sterne et al., 2016 ). This tool addresses \npotential risks, including confounding, selection bias, and missing data, ensuring a robust assessment of non-randomized studies; (b) as \na subset of observational studies, cross-sectional studies were assessed using the AXIS tool (Downes et al., 2016 ). This evaluation \nfocused on sampling methods, reliability of measures, and the overall quality of reporting within these studies; (c) the quality of GWAS \nwas appraised using the Venice criteria Ioannidis et al., 2008 ). These criteria evaluate the strength of evidence, consistency of \nreplication, and protection against bias in genetic association studies; (d) case reports and case series were reviewed using the Joanna \nBriggs Institute (JBI) tool (Munn et al., 2019 ). This assessment ensured methodological rigor and evaluated their clinical relevance and \ncontribution to the broader research field.\n4.10. Risk of bias assessment (ROB)\nFor the observational studies included in this review, the risk of bias was evaluated across six key domains: selection, performance, \ndetection, attrition, reporting, and other sources of bias (see Fig. 2). Detection and attrition domains consistently exhibited low risks of \nbias (green), indicating that the studies generally provided clear and reliable outcome measurements with minimal participant loss. \nHowever, the selection and performance domains were frequently rated as unclear (yellow), highlighting potential issues related to \nrecruitment transparency, randomization, and blinding protocols. Additionally, reporting biases (D5) were noted in several studies, \npointing to inconsistencies or gaps in the documentation of methods and findings. These findings underscore the need for more robust \nmethodological transparency and adherence to reporting guidelines to enhance the reliability of future research.\nRegarding observational studies, the Risk of Bias (ROB) assessment using the ROBINS-I framework identified varying levels of bias \nacross different types of studies. The ROBINS-I tool is specifically designed for non-randomized studies that aim to assess the effects of \ninterventions or exposures, such as cohort or case studies, where the goal is to draw causal inferences.

      "text": "Siepsiak et al. (2023) , both non-randomized observational studies, demonstrated moderate overall risks of bias, with specific concerns \nin confounding (D1) and missing data (D5). Despite these concerns, low risks of bias were consistently observed in domains such as \ndeviations from intended interventions (D4) and measurement of outcomes (D6) across most studies (Fig. 3).\nThe risk of bias assessment for Smit et al. indicated an overall low risk of bias. The study demonstrated low risks in the domains of \namount of evidence (D1) and replication (D2), while there was an unclear risk in the domain of protection from bias (D3). This suggests \na strong overall methodological quality with minor concerns regarding bias protection (Fig. 4).\nIn addition, the ROB assessment for the included case reports highlighted several strengths and limitations. The case report by Pan \net al. (2022) provided detailed descriptions of the patient ’s demographics, clinical history, intervention (risperidone), and outcomes, \nmeeting most JBI criteria. However, the case series by Swonke et al. (2025) provided valuable insights into pediatric misophonia, with \nclear descriptions of clinical presentations and family history, but it lacked explicit inclusion criteria, standardized diagnostic methods, \nconsistent recruitment processes, and follow-up information, leading to moderate-to-high risk of bias.\n5.Discussion\nThe findings of this systematic review provide critical insights into the interplay between misophonia, sensory sensitivities, and \nautism, emphasizing its complex and multifaceted nature. Despite growing awareness, misophonia remains both underrecognized and \nunderreported, as evidenced by the significant discrepancy between its estimated prevalence and the proportion of individuals actively \nseeking help (Jager et al., 2020 ). Prevalence rates vary widely across populations, with younger individuals and autistic individuals \nexhibiting notably higher rates of clinically significant misophonia, as highlighted in the studies by Williams et al. (2022) and Cengiz \nKılıç et al. (2021) . These findings suggest that misophonia is not merely a sensory condition but strongly associated with develop -\nmental, cultural, and demographic factors.\nThe clinical profile of misophonia is marked by intense emotional responses, such as anger and distress, triggered by specific \nsounds, including eating, breathing, and throat noises. These triggers, often consistent across age groups, can severely disrupt daily \nfunctioning, interpersonal relationships, and overall quality of life. Responses can differ across age groups, such as aggression in \nyounger children and self-harming behaviors in older individuals, underscoring the importance of tailoring interventions to specific \nage groups. The results of this review align with previous research by Schroder et al. (2013) and Guzick et al. (2023) and Williams et al. \n(2021) reinforcing the need for further exploration of these developmental patterns.\nThe heightened sensory sensitivities observed in individuals with misophonia, particularly in the auditory, visual, and tactile \ndomains, highlight potential overlap with autism. Studies by Rinaldi et al. (2023) and Scheerer et al. (2024) suggest that sensory \nhypersensitivity is a common feature in both conditions. However, it remains uncertain whether this overlap indicates a distinct \nsensory phenotype, as shared symptoms across different disorders do not necessarily imply a unified sensory profile. This shared \nsensory sensitivity, coupled with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life, underscores the need for clinical \ninterventions that address both sensory and psychological impacts\nAdditionally, psychiatric comorbidities significantly complicate the clinical profile of misophonia, with high rates of depression, \nanxiety, OCD, and ADHD documented across studies. Guzick et al. (2023) and Jager et al. (2020) highlighted the profound impact of \nthese comorbidities on quality of life, a finding consistent with earlier research by Dozier (2015) and Kumar et al. (2017) . While \nmisophonia frequently co-occurs with autism, current evidence does not support its use as a unique marker for autism diagnosis. \nInstead, it is a distinct sensory condition that can also present in neurotypical individuals and those with other psychiatric conditions. \nHowever, given its significant impact, misophonia should be carefully considered in the management of autistic individuals, ensuring \nthat interventions address both sensory sensitivities and associated emotional distress.\nTreatment outcomes for misophonia show promising, though varied, results. Non-pharmacological interventions, including \ncognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) as described by Swonke et al. (2025) , and pharmacological \nFig. 3.Bias assessment using ROBINS-I tool.A.F. Aldakhil and R.A.

      "text": "treatments like low-dose risperidone as reported by Pan et al. (2022) , have demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms and improving \nquality of life. For instance, risperidone significantly lowered misophonia severity in a single case, while CBT and TRT are noted as \nmanagement strategies, though specific outcome data remain limited. Side effects such as weight gain with risperidone warrant \ncaution, and further studies are needed to substantiate these approaches. These findings align with Schroder et al. (2013) , emphasizing \nthe value of tailored, combined therapeutic strategies. Both intervention studies were single-case or small case-series designs, which \nlimits the generalizability of the conclusions. Future research should prioritize larger, well-controlled studies to confirm efficacy and \nbroaden applicability.\nEmerging evidence of genetic influences, as reported by Smit et al. (2023) , adds a new layer to understanding misophonia, sug-\ngesting a biological basis linked to traits such as neuroticism and irritability. This perspective is supported by Kumar et al. (2017) , who \nidentified neural hyperconnectivity in the anterior insular cortex as a potential mechanism. Moreover, advancements in psychometric \ntools, including the Pediatric Misophonia and Hyperacusis Questionnaire (PMHQ) validated by Carson et al. (2024) , enhance diag-\nnostic precision and aid in distinguishing misophonia from related sensory conditions.\nLastly, environmental factors, particularly maternal mental health, may play a crucial role in the development of misophonia. \nSiepsiak et al. (2023) found that higher rates of postpartum depression among mothers of children with misophonia suggest early \nfamilial and environmental influences. This highlights the importance of incorporating family-centered approaches in both research \nand intervention strategies. In summary, these findings emphasize the necessity for a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to miso-\nphonia, one that integrates sensory, psychiatric, genetic, and environmental perspectives.\nQuality Assessment Outcomes\nIn evaluating the quality of the studies included in this review, a thorough quality assessment was conducted using tools tailored to \nspecific study designs (as described in Section 3.8). The findings from this assessment underscore the need for caution in interpreting \nresults, particularly due to the varying levels of risk of bias across studies. Observational studies exhibited moderate-to-high risks of \nbias, particularly related to confounding factors and methodological transparency. Notably, the majority of studies lacked robust \nrandomization, blinding, and sample sizes large enough to ensure generalizability, which introduces potential biases in the inter-\npretation of treatment outcomes. The risk of bias was further compounded in case studies and single-case designs, which, while \nvaluable, have limited applicability to broader populations. These concerns emphasize the importance of future research employing \nmore rigorous, large-scale studies with transparent methodologies and consistent reporting standards to validate findings and support \nclinical applications\n5.1. Limitations\nThis review has several limitations that should be considered. First, the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of meth -\nodology, population demographics, and diagnostic criteria presents challenges in synthesizing findings. Variations in sample sizes, \nranging from large-scale genetic studies to individual case reports, limit the generalizability of the conclusions. Second, many studies \nrelied on self-reported measures, which may introduce recall bias or inaccuracies in assessing misophonia symptoms and related \noutcomes. Additionally, the cross-sectional design of most studies prevents drawing causal inferences regarding the relationships \nbetween misophonia, sensory sensitivities, and psychiatric comorbidities. Geographic and cultural differences across studies further \ncomplicate the extrapolation of findings to broader populations. Lastly, the underrepresentation of certain demographic groups, such \nas non-binary individuals and older adults, limits the inclusivity of the conclusions. In terms of study quality, the risk of bias across the \nincluded studies was notable. Many observational studies exhibited moderate-to-high risks of bias, particularly in areas such as \nconfounding, selection bias, and transparency in reporting. The case reports and case series, though valuable for offering clinical \ninsights, were limited by small sample sizes and a high risk of bias due to methodological constraints. Despite these limitations, the \nconsistency of findings across various studies indicates some level of reliability, though the overall quality of evidence remains mixed. \nTherefore, future research should prioritize larger, well-controlled studies with more consistent methodologies to reduce bias and \nenhance the robustness of findings.\n5.2. Clinical recommendations\nFuture research should focus on standardizing diagnostic criteria and assessment tools for autistic populations, enabling more \nFig. 4.Bias assessment using the Venice criteria.A.F.

      "text": "reliable and comparable studies. Longitudinal studies are essential to uncover the causal relationships between misophonia symptoms \nand psychiatric comorbidities in autistic individuals, offering insights for future interventions and management strategies. Addi-\ntionally, further investigation into the genetic contributions to misophonia is necessary to assess heritability patterns and the biological \npredisposition in autistic individuals.\nThe inclusion of a comprehensive assessment protocol in the evaluation of autistic patients is recommended to identify those at \nhigher risk for misophonia. This would allow for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at managing sensory \ntriggers and improving the quality of life for these patients. Clinicians should adopt a multidisciplinary approach when managing \nmisophonia, incorporating validated diagnostic tools, such as the Pediatric Misophonia and Hyperacusis Questionnaire, to inform \ncomprehensive assessments. Interventions should be individualized and may include behavioral therapy, pharmacological options, \nand family-centered care. Early identification and intervention, especially in autistic populations or those with a family history of \nmental health issues, are vital for mitigating the impact of misophonia. Furthermore, integrated care models that address psychiatric \ncomorbidities, along with increased education and awareness to reduce stigma and improve access to care, are crucial for enhancing \ntreatment outcomes and overall quality of life.\n6.Conclusion\nThis systematic review highlights the complex relationship between misophonia, sensory sensitivities, and autism, emphasizing its \nmultifactorial nature. It calls for a holistic approach that integrates sensory, psychiatric, genetic, and environmental factors to improve \ndiagnosis, intervention, and quality of life. Despite growing research, significant gaps remain in understanding misophonia’s etiology, \ndevelopment, and treatment. Future studies should focus on longitudinal designs, diverse populations, and standardized diagnostic \ncriteria to advance the field, ultimately improving outcomes for autistic individuals with misophonia and related conditions.\nEthical considerations\nNot applicable.\nConsent to participate\nNot applicable.\nConsent for publication\nNot applicable.\nFunding statement\nThe authors extend the appreciation to the Deanship of Postgraduate Studies and Scientific Research at Majmaah University for \nfunding this research work through the project number R-2025-1677.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nAldakhil Ali F: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Supervision, Project administration, Methodology, Concep -\ntualization.
