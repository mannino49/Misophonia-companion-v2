Additionally, DVMSQ items were\nused to operationalize diagnostic criteria for misophonia derived from the\nRevised Amsterdam Criteria, which were further updated to reﬂect a recent\nconsensus deﬁnition of misophonia (published after the development of the\nDVMSQ). Using the new DVMSQ algorithm, 7.3% of general population adults\nand 35.5% of autistic adults met criteria for clinically signiﬁcant misophonia.\nAlthough additional work is needed to further investigate the psychometric\nproperties of the DVMSQ and validate its theory-based screening algorithm\nusing best-estimate clinical diagnoses, this novel measure represents a\npotentially useful tool to screen for misophonia and quantify symptom\nseverity and impairment in both autistic adults and the general population.\nKEYWORDS\nmisophonia, decreased sound tolerance, screening, diagnosis, psychometric,\nmeasurement, autism, item response theory\nIntroduction\nMisophonia is a newly described disorder of sound\ntolerance in which individuals have strong negative emotional\nresponses to speciﬁc “trigger” sounds (e.g., chewing, tapping,\nand sniﬄing), resulting in signiﬁcant distress, pathological\navoidance behavior, and impairment in daily life (Schröder\net al., 2013; Potgieter et al., 2019; Swedo et al., 2022). When\nencountering a trigger sound or other non-auditory stimuli\nassociated with such sounds (e.g., the sight of an individual\neating), individuals with misophonia frequently experience\nemotions such as anger, extreme irritation, disgust, or anxiety,\npotentially combined with a “ﬁght or ﬂight” response and non-\nspeciﬁc physical symptoms such as muscle tension, increased\nheart rate, or sweating (Edelstein et al., 2013; Rouw and\nErfanian, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022). Other\nstimuli, such as purely visual triggers (e.g., a leg bouncing up\nand down; Schröder et al., 2013; Jaswal et al., 2021) or simply\nimagining a trigger sound (Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-Llort,\n2021) may also be suﬃcient to trigger full-blown misophonic\nreactions in some cases. Misophonia is distinct from other\nforms of decreased sound tolerance such as hyperacusis (a\ndisorder in which sounds of moderate intensity are perceived\nas excessively loud or physically painful) and phonophobia (a\nspeciﬁc phobia of certain sounds or sound sources), although\nthese diﬀerent conditions may co-occur in some individuals\n(Fagelson and Baguley, 2018; Fackrell et al., 2019; Adams\net al., 2021; Williams et al., 2021c,d; Siepsiak et al., 2022).\nA recent epidemiologic study using semi-structured clinical\ninterviews estimated the prevalence of clinically signiﬁcant\nmisophonia to be 12.8% among older adolescents and adults\nin one urban area (Kılıç et al., 2021), additionally ﬁnding\nmisophonia status to be associated with female sex, younger\nage, and multiple co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Notably,research on misophonia is in its infancy, and there is much still\nto be learned about the phenomenology of this condition, its\nunderlying pathophysiology, and the most appropriate ways to\nscreen for, diagnose, and treat misophonia in clinical practice.\nAs misophonia has not been formally adopted as a\nclinical diagnosis within existing frameworks such as the\nInternational Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related\nHealth Problems (ICD; World Health Organization, 2019) or\nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM; American Psychiatric Association, 2022), there remains\na lack of consensus among stakeholders regarding the speciﬁc\ncriteria used to determine misophonia “caseness” (i.e., the status\nof an individual having clinically signiﬁcant misophonia) within\nresearch and clinical practice. Operational diagnostic criteria\nhave been proposed by multiple research groups (Schröder et al.,\n2013; Dozier et al., 2017; Jager et al., 2020; Kılıç et al., 2021;\nGuetta et al., 2022), but none of these criteria were endorsed\nin a recent expert consensus deﬁnition of misophonia (Swedo\net al., 2021, 2022). Moreover, while the published consensus\ndeﬁnition of misophonia did deviate from existing sets of\ndiagnostic criteria such as the Revised Amsterdam Criteria\n(Jager et al., 2020), the authors of the consensus statement\ndid not publish speciﬁc diagnostic criteria in line with their\ndeﬁnition. Therefore, in order for this foundational deﬁnition\nto be applied in research and practice, additional work is\nnecessary to both (a) distil the consensus deﬁnition down to\na set of diagnostic criteria and (b) operationalize these new\nmisophonia criteria using standardized instruments such as\nstructured interviews or questionnaires.\nThe present study sought to build on the newly proposed\nconsensus deﬁnition of misophonia by providing an initial\ndraft of updated diagnostic criteria and speciﬁc ways in\nwhich those criteria can be assessed using a published but\nnot yet validated assessment, the duke-vanderbilt Misophonia\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org"

Although a large\nnumber of novel self-report questionnaires have recently been\nproposed to measure misophonia severity (Schröder et al.,\n2013; Wu et al., 2014; Jager et al., 2020; Siepsiak et al., 2020;\nDibb et al., 2021; Remmert et al., 2021; Rinaldi et al., 2021;\nRosenthal et al., 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2021), the DVMSQ\ndiﬀers from the majority of these measures in that it was\nspeciﬁcally designed to operationalize the diagnostic criteria for\nmisophonia as proposed by diﬀerent authors (Schröder et al.,\n2013; Dozier et al., 2017; Jager et al., 2020). Further, unlike\nother measures, which typically assign misophonia caseness on\nthe basis of theoretically or empirically based cutoﬀ scores,\nthe DVMSQ provides a criterion-based algorithm to determine\nwhether an individual reports all symptoms and suﬃcient\nfunctional impairment to warrant being classiﬁed as having\nclinically signiﬁcant misophonia. In the context of our proposed\noperational diagnostic criteria, derived in accord with both the\nRevised Amsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020) and the recent\nconsensus deﬁnition of misophonia (Swedo et al., 2022), the\nDVMSQ diagnostic algorithm represents the ﬁrst systematic\nattempt to apply the misophonia consensus deﬁnition in\nthe context of a psychometric instrument. This measure’s\nrelative brevity, focus on theoretically “core” symptoms of\nthe misophonia construct, and broad characterization of\nmisophonia-related impairment suggest that the DVMSQ has\npotential utility as a dimensional measure of misophonia\nseverity in both research and clinical practice.\nMethods\nRationale and item pool development\nThe DVMSQ (Williams et al., 2021a) was created by the\nﬁrst author (ZJW) in collaboration with colleagues at the\nDuke Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation (M.\nZ. Rosenthal, C. Cassiello-Robbins, and D. Anand) during\nthe development of the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire\n(DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021). While the 86-item DMQ was\ndesigned to comprehensively assess many diﬀerent aspects of\nthe misophonia construct (e.g., triggers, symptoms, cognitions,\ncoping behaviors, beliefs, and impairment) in granular detail,\nthe measure was not designed to assess all proposed diagnostic\ncriteria or to discriminate between individuals with and without\nmisophonia. Thus, the DVMSQ was created as a relatively brief\ncomplementary measure that (a) assessed diagnostic featuresproposed to be “core” to the misophonia construct and (b)\nquantiﬁed impairment due to misophonia, both in terms of\ninterference with speciﬁc life domains and perceived global\nimpact on one’s life.\nItems on the original DVMSQ ( Table 1 ) were adapted\nfrom the Revised Amsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020),\nassessing the diagnostic features of (a) presence of speciﬁc\n“trigger” sounds, (b) intense emotional reactions (extreme\nirritation, anger, disgust), (c) acknowledgment that emotional\nreactions are excessive, (d) loss of self-control, (e) avoidance\nof triggers and/or endurance of triggers with distress, and (f)\nassociated impairment due to symptoms (social, occupational,\ndomestic, and community domains). An item about physical\nsymptoms in reaction to triggers was additionally included\nto capture criterion B (i.e., the trigger stimulus elicits an\nimmediate physical reﬂex response) as proposed by Dozier\net al. (2017). Based on content areas represented in the\nbroader DMQ item pool (see Rosenthal et al., 2021 for more\ndetails), items were also added to assess (a) fear or panic in\nresponse to triggers, (b) attentional capture by trigger sounds,\nand (c) perceived global impact (including negative eﬀects on\nmental health). Notably, while speciﬁc eﬀorts were made during\nthe development of the DMQ to separate “double-barreled”\nitems, items of the DVMSQ were written to be more general,\noften combining multiple related emotions or sensations into\nsingle items for the sake of brevity and to reduce local item\ndependence. All items were initially drafted by ZJW, and\nwording was iteratively reﬁned until consensus was achieved.\nAs an important caveat, the development and ﬁnalization\nof the DVMSQ occurred before the initial publication of\nthe misophonia consensus deﬁnition (Swedo et al., 2021),\nand thus, not all aspects of the condition mentioned in\nthe consensus deﬁnition and proposed diagnostic criteria are\nincluded in the DVMSQ. Nevertheless, as existing DVMSQ\nitems operationalize all but one of the proposed diagnostic\ncriteria (symptom duration \u00156 months), the measure represents\na reasonable approximation of the misophonia construct as\nrecently deﬁned.\nOperational diagnostic criteria for\nmisophonia\nIn order to create operational diagnostic criteria that could\nbe assessed using the DVMSQ, we began with the Revised\nAmsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020), modifying each criterion\nto align more closely with the recent misophonia consensus\ndeﬁnition (Swedo et al., 2021, 2022). The misophonia diagnostic\ncriteria used in the current study (see also Williams, 2022)\nare presented in Table 2 , along with the operationalization\nof each criterion by the DVMSQ items.

Thus, while our study does\nrepresent the ﬁrst attempt to derive a diagnostic algorithm\nthat incorporates the misophonia consensus deﬁnition, the\nspeciﬁc criteria proposed should be treated as provisional and\nsuperseded by more rigorously developed “consensus diagnostic\ncriteria” for misophonia as soon as such criteria are made\navailable.\nTABLE 1 Original DVMSQ items, content, and response options.\nItem Verbatim content Response options\nS1 Are there speciﬁc sounds that you are extremely bothered by, even if they are not\nloud?

The primary sample analyzed in this\ninvestigation is a large online general-population sample of\nadults in the United States ( n= 1403) recruited from the\nProliﬁc crowdsourcing platform (Palan and Schitter, 2018;\nStanton et al., 2022). Additionally, in order to assess the\npsychometric properties of the DVMSQ in autistic adults, we\nexamined data from a sample of independent autistic adults\n(n= 936) from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism\nResearch for Knowledge (SPARK) cohort (Feliciano et al., 2018).\nNotably, data from the SPARK sample were predominantly\nincluded to assess the latent structure of the DVMSQ in the\nautistic population and to examine diﬀerential item functioning\nacross diagnostic groups; thus, the majority of analyses inthe current study focus exclusively on the general population\n(Proliﬁc) sample.\nGeneral population (Proliﬁc) sample\nA sample of general population adults was recruited from\nthe Proliﬁc crowdsourcing platform (Palan and Schitter, 2018;\nStanton et al., 2022) in the fall of 2021. Eligibility criteria\nincluded age 18 or older, living in the United States, speaking\nEnglish ﬂuently, having answered Proliﬁc demographic\nquestions about autism status and current mental health\nconditions (any non-missing response to both questions was\nsuﬃcient for inclusion), not endorsing a diagnosis of dementia\nor mild cognitive impairment, having completed at least 50\nprevious Proliﬁc tasks, and a 95% or higher approval rate on\nProliﬁc. Individuals endorsing severe/profound hearing loss\nor the use of cochlear implants were also excluded from the\ncurrent study post hoc .

Presence of one or more commonplace “trigger” soundsathat reliably elicit\nintense and inappropriate emotional responses, irrespective of sound intensity or\nperceived loudness.Item S1 [Screening] = Yes\nB. Trigger sounds reliablybevoke feelings of extreme irritation, anger, rage and/or\ndisgustcthat are clearly excessive, unreasonable, or out of proportion to the\ncircumstances (whether or not the individual recognizes them as such).One or more of the following:\nItem 1 [Irritation]\u0015Often\nItem 2 [Anger/Rage] \u0015Often\nItem 4 [Disgust]\u0015Often\nC. The individual actively avoidsdsituations or activities that include trigger sounds,\nendures these situations with intense discomfort, or needs to block out potential\ntrigger sounds (e.g., using earplugs, music, or white noise) to cope with these\nsituations.One or more of the following:\nItem 12 [Avoidance] \u0015Sometimes\nItem 5 [Urge to run away] \u0015Often\nItem 6 [Urge to cover ears] \u0015Often\nD. If unable to avoid trigger sounds or stop them from occurring, the individual\nexperiences a signiﬁcant loss of self-control, potentially resulting in emotional\noutbursts or other extreme reactions (e.g., yelling/screaming, running out of the\nroom, panic attacks, and rarely physical aggression).One or more of the following:\nItem 8 [Lack of Control] \u0015Sometimes\nItem 7 [Urge to be violent] \u0015Sometimes\nE. The emotional reactions to trigger sounds are persistent, typically lasting for\n6 months or more. Speciﬁc triggers do not need to remain constant over this period,\nbut at least one trigger sound must meet both criteria A and B at all times over the\npreceding 6-month period.Not assessed by DVMSQ Assumed to be true if all other criteria\nare satisﬁed.\nF. Emotional reactions to trigger sounds and/or avoidance of these sounds cause\nclinically signiﬁcant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\nimportant areas of functioning.Two or more of the following:\nItem 13 [Social]\u0015Moderate\nItem 14 [Occupational] \u0015Moderate\nItem 15 [Household] \u0015Moderate\nItem 16 [Community] \u0015Moderate\nItem 18 [Mental Health] \u0015Moderate\nItem 19 [Global Problems] \u0015Moderate\nItem 20 [Life Aﬀected] \u0015Moderate\nTo meet the duke-vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ) criteria for “clinically signiﬁcant misophonia, ” an individual must meet all criteria A–F (criteria E is not\nassessed by the DVMSQ and is assumed to be true if all others are satisﬁed). Individuals who meet criteria A–D but not criterion F are classiﬁed as having “sub-clinical misophonia.” Note\nthat the item numbers in this algorithm refer to the original DVMSQ and not the revised version provided in the supplemental information.\naIn accordance with the recent consensus deﬁnition of misophonia, these criteria do not require that the individual be triggered by chewing or other oro-nasal sounds.\nbThese emotional reactions may be dependent on the context in which the trigger is encountered (e.g., only occurring when the trigger is produced by a speciﬁc person), but the reaction\nshould be easily reproducible within that speciﬁc context.\ncEmotional responses to trigger sounds may be accompanied by fear, anxiety, or physical symptoms of sympathetic arousal (e.g., heart pounding, muscle tension, sweating, and\nparesthesia), but in the absence of anger, irritation or disgust, these reactions are insuﬃcient to meet criterion B.\ndIncludes both direct avoidance of the trigger stimulus and indirect avoidance (i.e., actions taken to stop the stimulus from occurring, such as telling another person to stop making a\nsound, removing triggering household items, etc.).\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org"

Participants were excluded if they (a)\nfailed one or more directed-response attention check questions\nembedded within the survey (e.g., “To show that you are paying\nattention, please leave this question blank”), (b) endorsed a\ndiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia despite denying\nthat diagnosis on their Proliﬁc demographics, (c) endorsed one\nor more “infrequency” items in the medical history (e.g., a\nreported history of temporal lobectomy), (d) provided symptom\ninformation that was inconsistent with their lifetime medical\ndiagnoses (e.g., endorsed migraines caused by sound but denied\nexperiencing migraines), (e) reported information about their\ndemographics or autism diagnostic status that was inconsistent\nwith the information provided on their Proliﬁc demographics\nform, (f) completed the survey in an exceptionally short amount\nof time (i.e., more than three median absolute deviations below\nthe median completion time), or (g) endorsed random or\ndishonest responding when queried at the end of the survey\nwith “no penalty honesty check” questions (e.g., “ Did you answer\nany survey questions in this survey randomly? Your answer will\nnot aﬀect your compensation for this survey. ”). Participants were\nalso excluded if they completed the survey from a virtual private\nnetwork, an IP address located outside of the United States, or an\nIP address associated with multiple survey respondents. Of the\n1610 individuals who consented for the study, 1516 individuals\ncompleted the full Proliﬁc survey and had their submissions\napproved. Of these participants, 113 individuals (7.5%) were\nexcluded for failing one or more data quality check, leaving\na ﬁnal sample of 1403 individuals whose data were analyzed\nfor the current study (note that not all 1403 individuals were\nincluded in all analyses).\nAutistic (SPARK) sample\nA sample of legally independent autistic adults was\nrecruited from the SPARK Research Match service (Project\nNo. RM0111Woynaroski_DST). A largely overlapping sample\nhas previously been described elsewhere (Williams et al.,\n2022). Eligibility criteria included age 18 or older, self-\nreported professional diagnoses of autism spectrum disorderor equivalent conditions (e.g., Asperger syndrome, Pervasive\nDevelopmental Disorder–Not Otherwise Speciﬁed), and legal\nindependence (i.e., ability to consent for oneself). Although\nautism diagnoses were not independently conﬁrmed, prior\nresearch has generally supported the validity of self-reported\nautism diagnoses within the SPARK cohort (Fombonne\net al., 2021). These participants completed a series of\nonline surveys assessing demographics, medical/psychiatric\nhistory, core features of autism, co-occurring psychopathology,\nsomatic symptom burden, and quality of life, and the\ninstruments administered partially overlapped with those\nin the Proliﬁc study. Surveys were completed within the\nSPARK web platform using custom software designed by\nTempus Dynamics (Baltimore, MD, United States), and\nparticipants were compensated with $10 USD in Amazon\ngift cards upon completion of all surveys. All participants\ngave informed consent, and all study procedures were\napproved by the institutional review board at Vanderbilt\nUniversity Medical Center.\nIndividuals in the SPARK sample additionally underwent\na series of similar quality checks to the Proliﬁc sample.\nSpeciﬁcally, survey participants from the SPARK RM sample\nwere excluded if they (a) met the SPARK deﬁnition of a possibly\ninvalid autism diagnosis (e.g., age of diagnosis is under 1 year\nof age; diagnosis rescinded by a professional), (b) did not\nself-report a professional diagnosis of autism on the study-\nspeciﬁc demographics form, (c) reported demographic variables\n(e.g., age, sex at birth, receipt of special education services\nin childhood) that were inconsistent with those originally\nreported to SPARK, (d) reported the use of a cochlear\nimplant, or (e) endorsed a professional diagnosis of either\nAlzheimer’s disease or dissociative identity disorder (indicating\neither careless/random responding or a true diagnosis that\ncould compromise the validity of self-report). Additionally,\nindividuals who dropped out of the study before completing\nthe DVMSQ and other sound tolerance measures were not\nincluded in the current analyses. Of the 1271 individuals who\ninitially consented for the study, 1121 completed the measures\nof interest. Of these individuals, an additional 185 (16.5%) were\nexcluded after failing one or more data quality checks, leaving a\nﬁnal sample of 936 autistic adults from SPARK whose data were\nanalyzed in the current study.\nMeasures\nDuke-vanderbilt misophonia screening\nquestionnaire\nThe duke-vanderbilt misophonia Screening Questionnaire\n(DVMSQ; Williams et al., 2021a) is a brief self-report measure\ndesigned to assess the symptoms of misophonia proposed in\nthe Revised Amsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020), as well\nas functional impairment due to misophonia.

The version of\nthe DVMSQ administered to the Proliﬁc and SPARK cohorts\ncontained 21 items (one Yes/No “screening” item and 20 Likert\nitems), as well as two free-text ﬁelds to allow participants to\nexpand upon their trigger sounds and trigger-evoked physical\nsymptoms, respectively (see Table 1 for full item content).\nRespondents are ﬁrst asked a single screening question (“ Are\nthere speciﬁc sounds that you are extremely bothered by, even\nif they are not loud? Examples include: chewing, slurping,\ncrunching, throat clearing, ﬁnger tapping, foot shuﬄing, keyboard\ntapping, rustling, nasal sounds, pen clicking, appliance humming,\nclock ticking, and animal sounds. ”), and if they respond “No” to\nthis question, no further DVMSQ items are administered. For\nparticipants who answer the screening question aﬃrmatively,\nthey are presented with a free-text ﬁeld in which they are\nasked to list their speciﬁc trigger sounds. The remaining\nquestions include 12 “symptom frequency” items (rated on a\n5-point Likert scale from 0 = “ Never ” to 4 = “ Very often ”),\nas well as 8 “impairment” items (rated on a 5-point Likert\nscale from 0 = “ Not at all ” to 4 = “ An extreme amount ”).\nA subset of these items is additionally used to operationalize\nthe misophonia diagnostic criteria presented in this study (see\nTable 2 for speciﬁcs). Scores on the 20 DVMSQ symptom and\nimpairment items were examined in the psychometric analysis\nof the current study.\nDuke misophonia questionnaire\nThe Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal\net al., 2021) is an 86-item modular self-report questionnaire\nthat assesses a wide range of misophonia-related constructs,\nincluding speciﬁc triggers, trigger frequency, responses to\nmisophonic triggers (aﬀective, physiological, and cognitive),\nspeciﬁc coping strategies (before, during and after being\ntriggered), misophonia-related impairment, and dysfunctional\nbeliefs related to misophonia. This measure was rigorously\ndeveloped using an iterative item generation process with\nsuggestions and feedback directly from individuals with\nmisophonia and their families, and a preliminary psychometric\nstudy has established the latent structure, reliability, and\nconvergent validity of the DMQ subscales in a sample of\ngeneral-population adults (Rosenthal et al., 2021). In order to\nreduce participant burden in the Proliﬁc and SPARK surveys,\nparticipants completed an abbreviated version of the DMQ that\nincluded only (a) the trigger list (16 Yes/No items), (b) the\n“frequency of being triggered” item (6-point Likert scale from\n1 = “ Once per month or less ” to 6 = “ 6 or more times per day ”),\n(c) the 23 DMQ symptom scale (DMQ-SS) items (5 aﬀective, 8\nphysiological, 10 cognitive; rated on a 5-point Likert scale from\n0 = “ Not at all ” to 4 = “ Always/Almost always ”), and a novel\n“global impairment” item (“ Please rate the overall impact of ALL\nbothersome sounds on your life over the past month. ”) that was\nrated on a visual analog scale (V AS) ranging from 0 = “ No Eﬀect”to 100 = “ Extreme Eﬀect. ” SPARK participants also completed\nthe DMQ Impairment Scale (12 items), but, given the focus of\nthe current investigation of this study on the Proliﬁc sample, this\nscale was not examined in our analyses. Participants who did\nnot endorse any triggers on the trigger list did not complete the\nremaining DMQ questions. Measures derived from the DMQ\nincluded (a) number of trigger categories endorsed (range 0–\n15), trigger frequency (range 1–6), DMQ-SS mean symptom\nscore (range 0–4), and global impairment V AS (range 0–100).\nThe reliability of the DMQ-SS in the Proliﬁc sample was\nexcellent ( a= 0.946), and the DMQ-SS correlated strongly with\nall other DMQ-derived variables (number of trigger categories:\nr= 0.545, CI 95%[0.501, 0.587]; trigger frequency: rpoly= 0.635,\nCI95% [0.597, 0.670]; global impairment V AS: r= 0.625, CI 95%\n[0.586, 0.661]).\nInventory of hyperacusis symptoms\nThe Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS; Greenberg\nand Carlos, 2018) is a 25-item self-report questionnaire designed\nto assess the symptoms of hyperacusis, as well as emotional\nresponses to sounds, quality of life, mental health impact, and\nfunctional impairment due to decreased sound tolerance. Items\nare organized into ﬁve empirically derived subscales, including\ngeneral loudness (3 items), emotional arousal (6 items),\npsychosocial impact (9 items), functional impact (5 items),\nand communication (2 items). This measure has demonstrated\nstrong reliability, as well as some degree of convergent/divergent\nvalidity in both an online sample of individuals with tinnitus\nand/or hyperacusis (Greenberg and Carlos, 2018) and a care-\nseeking sample of individuals attending a specialist tinnitus and\nhyperacusis clinic in the United Kingdom (Aazh et al., 2021).\nAlthough designed to speciﬁcally assess hyperacusis, the IHS\nhas not been formally tested in individuals with misophonia or\nother sound tolerance disorders; thus, it is unclear the degree\nto which the IHS subscales measuring emotional arousal and\npsychosocial/functional impact are confounded by misophonia\nseverity. Thus, while the IHS total score (range 25–100) was\nreported descriptively as a measure of “hyperacusis severity” in\nthe current study, the “general loudness” subscale (IHS-LOUD;\nrange 3–12) was examined in analyses of discriminant validity\ndue to its lack of content overlap with misophonia measures\nsuch as the DVMSQ and the DMQ. In the Proliﬁc sample,\nreliability was good for both the IHS total score ( a= 0.963) and\nthe IHS-LOUD score ( a= 0.803).\nDSM-5 severity measure for speciﬁc\nphobia–modiﬁed for phonophobia\nThe DSM-5 Severity Measure for Speciﬁc Phobia (DSM-\nSP; Lebeau et al., 2012) is a 10-item scale published by\nthe American Psychiatric Association to dimensionally assess\nsymptoms of speciﬁc phobias in adults. Participants are ﬁrst\nasked to determine which of ﬁve common phobia topics (e.g.,\n“Animals or insects ”; “Blood, needles, or injections ”) is most\nanxiety provoking for them, proceeding to rate their symptoms\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org"

Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale with\nresponses ranging from 0 = “ Never ” to 4 = “ All of the time , ”\nand the mean score (range 0–4) is calculated as a dimensional\nindex of phobia severity. The reliability and validity of the DSM-\nSP has been established in both clinical and non-clinical adult\nsamples (Lebeau et al., 2012; Knappe et al., 2013, 2014). In\nthe current study, this measure was modiﬁed to speciﬁcally\nassess phonophobia rather than other speciﬁc phobias. Thus,\nin the current study, we omitted the choice of phobic topics\nfrom the DSM-SP and instead administered the items with\nthe following instructions: “ The following questions ask about\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors that you may have had in a\nvariety of situations. Over the PAST SEVEN DAYS, how often\nhave you experienced the following regarding situations when you\nare exposed to loud or unpleasant sounds? ” The wording of the\nDSM-SP questions themselves was unchanged from the original\nversion. In the Proliﬁc sample, the reliability of the DSM-\nSP (with directions modiﬁed as detailed above) was excellent\n(a= 0.925).\nAdditional measures of psychopathology,\nsomatic symptoms, and quality of life\nSeveral additional self-report questionnaires (administered\nto the Proliﬁc sample only) were collected in order to assess\nthe nomological validity of the DVMSQ. Symptoms of general\nanxiety and depression were measured using the Overall Anxiety\nSeverity and Impairment Scale (OASIS; Norman et al., 2006)\nand Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS;\nBentley et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2015), respectively. Possible scores\non these measures range from 0 to 20, and reliabilities in the\nProliﬁc sample were good (OASIS: a= 0.862; ODSIS: a= 0.871).\nClinically relevant manifestations of anger (including subjective\nfeelings of anger, overt verbal aggression, and destructive urges)\nin the past week were assessed using the Clinically Useful Anger\nOutcome Scale (CUANGOS; Levin-Aspenson et al., 2021).\nCUANGOS scores range from 0 to 20, and reliability in the\nProliﬁc sample was good ( a= 0.857). Multi-system somatic\nsymptom burden was measured using the Somatic Symptom\nScale–8 (SSS-8; Gierk et al., 2014). SSS-8 total scores range from\n0 to 32, and this score exhibited good reliability in the Proliﬁc\nsample ( a= 0.814). Lastly, overall quality of life (i.e., general\nlife satisfaction) was measured using the 6-item Riverside Life\nSatisfaction Scale (RLSS; Margolis et al., 2019). RLSS total scores\nrange from 6 to 42, and reliability in the Proliﬁc sample was\nexcellent ( a= 0.900).\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.0 (R\nCore Team, 2021). Relevant demographic and clinical variables\nwere summarized descriptively. Diﬀerences between the Proliﬁc\nand SPARK samples on demographic and clinical variables werequantiﬁed using Cohen’s dfor continuous variables and odds\nratios (ORs) for categorical variables.\nDuke-vanderbilt misophonia screening\nquestionnaire item analysis\nItem-level statistics, including category endorsement\nfrequencies, percent endorsement of each item (at a level\nfulﬁlling the operational diagnostic criteria), and corrected\nitem-total (polyserial) correlations, were examined for\nall DVMSQ participants within the Proliﬁc sample who\naﬃrmatively answered the DVMSQ screening question\n(n= 833). We additionally calculated the polyserial correlation\nbetween each DVMSQ item and scores on (a) the DMQ-SS\n(misophonia symptoms), (b) the DSM-SP (phonophobia\nsymptoms), and (c) the IHS-LOUD (hyperacusis symptoms),\nwith the hypothesis that items measuring misophonia symptoms\n(though not necessarily items measuring misophonia-related\nimpairment) would correlate more strongly with the DMQ-SS\nthan with either the DSM-SP or IHS-LOUD.\nStructural analyses of the duke-vanderbilt\nmisophonia screening questionnaire\nIn order to assess the overall dimensionality of the DVMSQ,\nwe ﬁrst performed an exploratory graph analysis (EGA; Golino\nand Epskamp, 2017; Golino et al., 2020) using the EGAnet\nR package (Golino and Christensen, 2020). The EGA was\nperformed using a regularized partial correlation network\nbased on polychoric correlations (“EBICglasso” estimation with\ng= 0.5 and l= 0.1), and communities were determined\nusing the Walktrap algorithm with four steps (Christensen\net al., 2020). In order to better approximate the normal latent\ntrait distributions assumed by the polychoric correlations, the\nanalysis was performed on only data from individuals who\ncompleted all DVMSQ items (i.e., the zeros in the zero-\ninﬂated distribution were discarded). Although the number of\ndimensions was the primary variable of interest derived from\nthis analysis, we also investigated the community assignment of\nthe various DVMSQ items, determining whether this process\nidentiﬁed communities that conformed to the theoretical\ndimensions of symptoms and impairment. In cases where\nspeciﬁc items (particularly those not reﬂecting the operational\ndiagnostic criteria for misophonia) were not clustering as\nexpected with other items (i.e., an impairment item being\nassigned to a symptom dimension or vice versa), those items\nwere removed from the analysis, and the EGA process was\nrepeated. To further assess the dimensionality of the DVMSQ,\nwe additionally employed the Factor Forest method (Goretzko\nand Bühner, 2020, 2022), a novel machine-learning based factor\nretention criterion that has shown excellent performance in\nrecent simulation studies.\nAfter assessing the dimensionality of the full DVMSQ,\nwe investigated the latent structure of the symptom and\nimpairment dimensions separately using full-information\nbifactor item response theory (IRT) modeling with iterative\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org"

To perform our IRT analyses, the 833 individuals\nin the Proliﬁc sample who answered all DVMSQ questions\nwere divided into exploratory ( n= 417) and conﬁrmatory\n[holdout] ( n= 416) subsamples. A bifactor graded response\nmodel (Gibbons et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2011; Toland et al., 2017)\nwas ﬁt to item response data for symptoms and impairment\nitems separately in the exploratory subsample, with results\nfrom the EGA community assignment used to preliminarily\nassign items to speciﬁc factors. Models were ﬁt using the mirt\nR package (Chalmers, 2012), with the Bock and Aitkin (1981)\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm employed for models\nwithout cross-loadings on speciﬁc factors and the Quasi-Monte\nCarlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Hori et al., 2020)\nemployed for all other models.\nGlobal IRT model ﬁt was assessed using the limited-\ninformation C2ﬁt index (Cai and Monroe, 2014; Monroe and\nCai, 2015) accompanied by C2-based approximate ﬁt indices,\nincluding the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI C2; Cai et al., 2021),\nroot mean square error of approximation (RMSEA C2; Maydeu-\nOlivares and Joe, 2014), and standardized root-mean-square\nresidual (SRMR; Maydeu-Olivares and Joe, 2014). Local model\nmisﬁt was assessed based on examination of standardized\nresiduals, with | rres|>0.1 judged to indicate signiﬁcant\nmodel misspeciﬁcation. Additionally, local item dependence\nwas evaluated using the Q 3residual correlation (Yen, 1984),\nwith model-speciﬁc critical values based on the 99th percentile\nof a simulated distribution (1,000 simulated datasets) based\non parametric bootstrapping (Christensen et al., 2017). Within\nthe exploratory subsample, items that demonstrated either |\nrres|>0.1 or Q 3values above the empirical cutoﬀ value\nwere either deleted from the model or speciﬁed to load onto\nanother speciﬁc factor. Additionally, when an item loaded\npoorly onto a speciﬁc factor (i.e., standardized | l|<0.1),\nthat factor loading was set to zero in future model iterations.\nThis process was repeated until the ﬁnal exploratory models\nfor symptoms and impairment demonstrated no signiﬁcant\nlocal misspeciﬁcation and all speciﬁc factor loadings were\ngreater than 0.1. The exploratory model was then re-ﬁt in\nthe holdout sample, and global/local misﬁt were evaluated\nusing the same criteria. Final models for symptoms and\nimpairment were then re-ﬁt in the combined Proliﬁc sample\n(n= 833), and ﬁnal model parameters were examined.\nBifactor indices (Rodriguez et al., 2016) were also examined\nto evaluate each dimension’s model-based reliability (omega\ntotal [ &T]), general factor saturation (omega hierarchical\n[&H]), and essential unidimensionality (explained common\nvariance [ECV]).\nOnce psychometrically adequate models were chosen for\nboth symptoms and impairments, the two scale subsections wereﬁt within a single bifactor IRT model. This model was evaluated\nin the exploratory sample for potential misspeciﬁcation, with a\nslightly more relaxed misspeciﬁcation criterion of | rres|>0.15\nused to accommodate the larger model size and substantially\nincreased number of residual correlations. Misspeciﬁcations\nwere addressed iteratively, and the ﬁnal model ﬁt was tested\nin the hold-out sample for conﬁrmation. Once an adequate\nmodel was generated for the full DVMSQ, this model was ﬁt\nin the combined Proliﬁc sample ( n= 833), and ﬁnal model\nparameters (including model-based total score reliability [ &T],\ngeneral factor saturation [ &H], and essential unidimensionality\n[ECV]) were examined. This ﬁnal model generated in the\nProliﬁc sample was then re-ﬁt in the SPARK sample (again using\nonly the individuals who completed all DVMSQ items; n= 645)\nand evaluated for global and local misspeciﬁcation to determine\nwhether the structure of the DVMSQ was conﬁgurally invariant\nacross the two populations. Model parameters and bifactor\nindices in the autistic sample were also examined.\nOnce a structural model was found to adequately ﬁt both the\nProliﬁc and SPARK samples, we ﬁt multiple-group IRT models\nto the full dataset, which were then used to test diﬀerential\nitem functioning (DIF) of the DVMSQ items between diagnostic\ngroups. For the purpose of DIF analyses, individuals in the\nProliﬁc sample who self-reported an autism diagnosis were\nconsidered as belonging to the autism group. DIF testing was\nperformed using a version of the iterative Wald test procedure\nproposed by Cao et al. (2017), in which all items are tested for\nDIF using a “Wald-2” procedure (Woods et al., 2013), all items\nnot demonstrating DIF are selected as anchors, and the Wald\ntest is performed again on the remaining items iteratively until\nall tested items show DIF at the p<0.05 level (uncorrected).\nGiven the likelihood of this method to detect trivially small yet\nnon-zero DIF at the sample sizes tested in the current study\n(Williams et al., 2021b; Williams and Gotham, 2021a,b), items\nwith a standardized DIF eﬀect size (expected score standardized\ndiﬀerence [ESSD]; Meade, 2010) less than \u00060.2 (i.e., smaller\nthan Cohen’s (1988) deﬁnition of a “small” eﬀect) were also\nincluded as anchor items for the iterative Wald procedure.\nIn order to reduce computational burden and address model\nconvergence issues, means and variances of all speciﬁc factors\n(i.e., all factors except the general factor) were ﬁxed to the\nvalues used in the “Wald-2” procedure. This version of the\niterative Wald method was implemented using a custom R\nfunction written by the ﬁrst author (Williams, 2021).

Moreover, the combined biasing eﬀect of all DIF on\nsum score diﬀerences between groups (i.e., diﬀerential test\nfunctioning [DTF]) was evaluated in total score units (UETSDS)\nand Cohen dunits (ETSSD), with values of ETSSD >0.1 judged\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org"

In addition\nto assessing DIF by diagnostic group, we also examined DIF\nwithin the Proliﬁc sample according to age ( <30 vs.\u001530),\nsex (Female vs. Male), and level of education (any college\ndegree vs. “some college” or less). Notably, the cutpoints used\nto dichotomize age and education were chosen to allow for\nsuﬃciently large numbers of participants (i.e., >300) in each\nsubgroup, increasing the measurement precision in the focal\ngroup and power to detect signiﬁcant DIF.\nValidity testing\nAfter evaluating the latent structure and DIF of the DVMSQ,\nwe calculated summary scores for the measure, including a\ntotal score (17 items; range 0–68), symptom score (10 items;\nrange 0–40), and impairment score (7 items; range 0–28).\nTo assess the nomological validity of the DVMSQ-derived\nscores, we examined zero-order Pearson correlations between\nDVMSQ scores and correlates of interest (i.e., scores from the\nDMQ, IHS, DSM-SP , OASIS, ODSIS, CUANGOS, SSS-8, and\nRLSS) in both the whole Proliﬁc sample ( n= 1403) and the\nsubsample that completed all DVMSQ items ( n= 833). We\nhypothesized that the DVMSQ scores would exhibit strong\npositive correlations ( r>0.5) with all DMQ-derived scores\n(based on the minimal accepted criteria for convergent validity;\nCarlson and Herdman, 2012), as well as moderate positive\ncorrelations with all remaining variables ( r>0.3) except\nfor the RLSS score, which was expected to demonstrate a\nmoderate negative correlation with the DVMSQ ( r<\u00000.3).\nTo further demonstrate the construct validity of the DVMSQ\nscores, we used the Zou (2007) conﬁdence interval procedure\nto test whether the three DVMSQ-derived scores correlated\nmore highly with the DMQ-SS than with measures of other\ntypes of decreased sound tolerance (IHS-LOUD, DSM-SP),\nanxiety (OASIS), depression (ODSIS), or somatic symptoms\n(SSS-8). Moreover, given the central role that anger plays in\nthe construct of misophonia, we further hypothesized that the\nDVMSQ would correlate more highly with the CUANGOS\nscore than with either the OASIS or ODSIS. All comparisons\nbetween dependent correlations were conducted using the cocor\nR package (Diedenhofen and Musch, 2015).\nResults\nParticipant characteristics\nIn total, the combined sample included DVMSQ data from\n2339 individuals across the two data sources, 1478 of whom(Proliﬁc: n= 833; SPARK: n= 645) aﬃrmatively answered\nDVMSQ screening question S1 and went on to complete the full\nmeasure. Demographics and clinical characterization of each\nsample (as well as the portions of the sample who (a) had\nscreen-positive responses to DVMSQ item S1 [“S1 Positive”\ngroup] and (b) met the DVMSQ deﬁnition of misophonia\n[“Clinical Misophonia” group]) are presented in Table 3 . Adults\nin the current study ranged from 18 to 83 years old, with\nparticipants in the SPARK sample (mean [ SD] age = 37.49\n[13.28] years) being slightly older on average than those in\nthe Proliﬁc sample (mean [ SD] age = 32.27 [12.55] years),\nd= 0.41, CI 95% [0.32, 0.49]. Though the Proliﬁc sample had a\nbalanced sex ratio by design (51.1% female sex among retained\nparticipants), this was not the case for the SPARK sample (63.0%\nfemale sex), which contained a signiﬁcantly higher proportion\nof participants assigned female at birth, OR = 1.63, CI 95%\n[1.38, 1.93]. Non-Hispanic White participants made up the\nmajority of individuals in both samples (Proliﬁc: 70.4%; SPARK:\n80.1%), and approximately half of participants in each sample\nhad completed a 4-year college degree (Proliﬁc: 50.4%, SPARK:\n48.2%). The median age of autism diagnosis in the SPARK\nsample was 23.21 years (IQR [11.77, 36.79]), with 38.7% of\nthe sample being diagnosed with autism before the age of 18.\nNotably, an additional 32 individuals from the Proliﬁc sample\n(2.3% of total sample, 43.8% female, mean [ SD] age = 32.22\n[12.14] years) reported receiving professional diagnoses of\nautism at a median age of 22.50 years (IQR [15.75, 32.50],\nrange 3–50 years).\nBased on the DVMSQ algorithm, a total of 102 individuals\nin the Proliﬁc sample (7.3%, including 7 autistic adults) and\n332 individuals in the SPARK sample (35.5%) met criteria\nfor clinically signiﬁcant misophonia. Subclinical misophonia,\ndeﬁned as meeting all DVMSQ criteria except for the\n“impairment” criterion, was present in an additional 144 adults\nin the Proliﬁc sample (10.2%) and 97 adults in the SPARK\nsample (10.4%). Notably only 10 individuals in the Proliﬁc\nsample (0.7%) and 21 individuals in the SPARK sample (2.2%)\nreported being previously diagnosed with misophonia by a\nprofessional, with almost all of these individuals meeting\nDVMSQ criteria for misophonia (Proliﬁc: 7 Clinical, 2\nSubclinical, 1 No misophonia; SPARK: 19 Clinical, 1 Subclinical,\n1 No misophonia). Furthermore, over 85% of individuals with\nclinically signiﬁcant misophonia in both samples (Proliﬁc:\n90.2%; SPARK: 85.5%) reported oronasal or throat sounds as\namong their misophonic triggers (deﬁned as endorsing “ Mouth\nsounds while eating , ” “Nasal/throat sounds , ” and/or “ Mouth\nsounds while not eating ” on the DMQ trigger list).\nWithin the Proliﬁc sample, individuals meeting criteria\nfor clinically signiﬁcant misophonia were slightly younger\n(Misophonia: 29.69 years, Other: 32.48 years; d=\u00000.22,\nCI95% [\u00000.42,\u00000.02]), more likely to be female (Misophonia:\n72.5%, Other: 49.4%; OR = 2.70, CI 95% [1.73, 4.23]), and less\nlikely to have completed a 4-year college degree (Misophonia:\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org"

Item endorsement at levels\ncorresponding to the diagnostic criteria was highly variable\nand ranged from 7.4% ( Impairment – Community ) to 55.2%\n(Intense irritation or annoyance ). Corrected item-total polyserial\ncorrelations were high (median rit= 0.677, IQR [0.636, 0.765]),\nwith all correlations greater than 0.5 with the exception of item\n4 (Disgust ). Polyserial correlations between DVMSQ items\nand the DMQ-SS (median rpoly = 0.601, IQR [0.565, 0.639])\nwere somewhat higher on average than correlations with either\nthe IHS-LOUD subscale (median rpoly = 0.479, IQR [0.405,\n0.634]) or the DSM-SP score (median rpoly= 0.479, IQR [0.417,\n0.619]). Notably, the DVMSQ items assessing misophonia\nsymptoms tended to correlate more strongly with the DMQ-SS\nthan the IHS-LOUD or DSM-SP , but this was not typically\nthe case for the DVMSQ impairment items, several of which\ncorrelated more strongly with the IHS-LOUD and/or DSM-SP\nthan the DMQ-SS.\nDimensionality assessment\nExploratory graph analysis of the original 20 DVMSQ\nitems was conducted in the subset of Proliﬁc participants\nwho screened positive on DVMSQ item S1 ( n= 833),\nrevealing a partial correlation network with four communities.\nThese communities were interpreted as Symptoms: Anger and\nAggression (items 1, 2, 4, and 7). Symptoms: Distress and\nAvoidance (items 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12); Impairment: Speciﬁc(items 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17); and Impairment: Global Impact\n(items 3, 18, 19, and 20). Notably, item 3 ( Fear or panic )\nwas assigned to the “Impairment: Global Impact ”community\nrather than either of the symptom communities, suggesting\nthat it likely represented a separate latent variable than the\nother items tapping distress and avoidance. Thus, item 3 was\ndropped from the model, and the EGA was repeated with the\nremaining items. After removing item 3, the dimensionality and\ncommunity structure of the 19 remaining items did not change,\nand this structure was then used to inform the structure of IRT\nmodels for both symptoms (11 items) and impairment (8 items).\nFurther converging with the results of the EGA, the Factor\nForest method also found a four-dimensional structure to be\nmost likely, both before ( PkD4= 0.865) and after ( PkD4= 0.801)\nremoving item 3.\nItem response theory analyses\nMisophonia symptoms\nIn the exploratory subsample of Proliﬁc participants, we ﬁrst\nﬁt the 11 symptom items with a bifactor model, in which all\nitems loaded on one general factor, and each item additionally\nloaded on a speciﬁc factor based on its community assignment\nwithin the EGA (i.e., items 1, 2, 4, and 7 on speciﬁc factor\n1 and items 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 on speciﬁc factor 2).\nThis initial model demonstrated global ﬁt indices that were\nadequate overall ( C2(33) = 92.55, p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.976,\nRMSEA C2= 0.066, CI 90% [0.050, 0.082], SRMR = 0.041), and\nno local dependence, but two standardized residuals (items 4\n[Disgust ] and 5 [ Urge to run away ]:rres= 0.156; items 4 [ Disgust ]\nand 11 [ Excessive/unreasonable reactions ]:rres=\u00000.115) were\ngreater than 0.1, suggesting additional local misspeciﬁcation.\nFurthermore, while examination of factor loadings in this model\ndemonstrated large positive loadings on the general factor for\nall items (median lG= 0.714, range [0.464, 0.815]), loadings\non the “Distress and Avoidance” factor were negligible for\nitems 8 ( Loss of control ;lS2=\u00000.065) and 9 ( Attention\ncapture by trigger ;lS2= 0.008). Item 11 also demonstrated\nan unexpected loading pattern, with a strong general factor\nloading ( lG= 0.743) and a moderate negative loading on\nthe “Distress and Avoidance” factor ( lS2=\u00000.309). Thus,\nto correct the model misspeciﬁcation, we allowed item 4 to\nload onto both speciﬁc factors, ﬁxed the loadings of items\n8 and 9 on speciﬁc factor 2 to 0, and removed item 11\n(Excessive/unreasonable reactions ) from the model entirely. The\nresulting model demonstrated signiﬁcantly improved ﬁt in the\nexploratory subsample ( C2(26) = 33.53, p= 0.147, TLI C2= 0.996,\nRMSEA C2= 0.026, CI 90% [0.000, 0.050], SRMR = 0.028),\nno local dependence, no large residuals, and factor loadings\nall greater than 0.1.

This initial model demonstrated adequate global ﬁt\n(C2(17) = 55.19, p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.985, RMSEA C2= 0.073,\nCI90% [0.052, 0.095], SRMR = 0.041), no local dependence,and no large residuals. Additionally, loadings on the general\nfactor were strong for all items (median lG= 0.846, range\n[0.817, 0.886]), and all speciﬁc factor loadings were greater than\n0.1. However, when this model was re-ﬁt in the conﬁrmatory\nsubsample, the global ﬁt was substantially worse ( C2(17) = 75.01,\np<0.001, TLI C2= 0.978, RMSEA C2= 0.091, CI 90% [0.070,\n0.112], SRMR = 0.053). This decrement in ﬁt was accompanied\nby two large residual pairs (item 14 [ Impairment – Occupational ]\nand item 17 [ Impairment – Concentration ]:rres= 0.122; item\n14 and item 20 [ Global impact – Life worse ]:rres=\u00000.120),\nas well as signiﬁcant local dependence between items 14\nand 17 (Q 3= 0.276 [99th percentile: 0.233]). In response\nto this local misﬁt, we removed item 17 from the model,\nresulting in adequate global ﬁt ( C2(11) = 19.95, p= 0.046,\nTLI C2= 0.995, RMSEA C2= 0.044, CI 90% [0.006, 0.075],\nSRMR = 0.035), no large residuals, and no locally dependent\nitem pairs within the conﬁrmatory sample.

Bifactor coeﬃcients indicated high reliability\n(&T= 0.958), with almost all reliable variance accounted for\nby a single general “misophonia-related impairment” factor\n(&H= 0.905, ECV = 0.902).\nAll duke-vanderbilt misophonia screening\nquestionnaire items (symptoms and\nimpairment)\nWithin the exploratory Proliﬁc subsample, we ﬁt a bifactor\nmodel to all 17 remaining DVMSQ items, including one\ngeneral factor and four speciﬁc factors ( Anger and Aggression :\nitems 1, 2, 4, and 7; Distress and Avoidance : items 4, 5,\n6, 10, and 12; Overall Impairment : items 13, 14, 15, 16,\n18, 19, and 20; and Global Impact : items 18, 19, and 20).\nThis model ﬁt the data in the exploratory subsample well\n(C2(100) = 144.33, p= 0.002, TLI C2= 0.994, RMSEA C2= 0.033,\nCI90%[0.020, 0.044], SRMR = 0.044) and demonstrated no local\ndependence. However, two residual correlations exceeded 0.15\n(item 12 [ Avoidance of triggers ] and item 13 [ Impairment –\nSocial ]:rres= 0.163; item 12 and item 16 [ Impairment –\nCommunity ]:rres= 0.152), prompting us to allow item 12 to\ncross-load onto the “Overall Impairment” factor. The revised\nmodel demonstrated slightly improved ﬁt ( C2(99) = 129.62,\np= 0.021, TLI C2= 0.996, RMSEA C2= 0.027, CI 90% [0.011,\n0.039], SRMR = 0.035), no residual correlations greater than\n0.15, and no locally dependent item pairs. This revised model\nwas then re-ﬁt in the conﬁrmatory sample, again exhibiting\nadequate global ﬁt ( C2(99) = 188.05, p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.988,\nRMSEA C2= 0.047, CI 90% [0.036, 0.057], SRMR = 0.046), no\nlarge residuals, and no local dependence. The same model\nﬁt in the SPARK sample also demonstrated adequate ﬁt in\nthe population of autistic adults ( C2(99) = 196.06, p<0.001,\nTLI C2= 0.991, RMSEA C2= 0.039, CI 90% [0.031, 0.047],\nSRMR = 0.042), as well as no local misﬁt or locally dependent\nitem pairs. Parameters for the combined model in both the\nProliﬁc and SPARK samples are presented in Table 5 . Notably,\nwhile reliability of the DVMSQ total score was very high\nin both samples (Proliﬁc: &T= 0.977; SPARK: &T= 0.957;\nSupplementary Tables 5 ,6), the “general misophonia” factor\nexplained a smaller relative proportion of total score variance\n(Proliﬁc: &H= 0.756, ECV = 0.586; SPARK: &H= 0.740,\nECV = 0.567), seemingly due to the sizable minority of\nvariance in DVMSQ impairment items attributed to the “Overall\nImpairment” factor (Proliﬁc: &HS= 0.457; SPARK: &HS= 0.474).\nMoreover, the DVMSQ symptom and impairment scales\ndemonstrated signiﬁcant convergence (Proliﬁc: r= 0.560, CI 95%\n[0.512, 0.605]; SPARK: r= 0.617, CI 95%[0.567, 0.662]), although\nthe magnitude of their intercorrelation was low enough to\nsuggest that the two scores may diﬀerentially correlate with\nexternal variables in some cases (Carlson and Herdman, 2012).\nFor the 17 DVMSQ items included in the ﬁnal model, DIF\nwas evaluated using the iterative Wald test procedure. Based onthese tests, statistically signiﬁcant DIF (i.e., pFDR<0.05 and |\nESSD| >0.2) was detected in four DVMSQ items (4, 10, 12,\nand 16; Table 6 ), although only the DIF in item 12 ( Avoidance of\ntriggers ; ESSD = 0.587) was large enough to meet our threshold\nof practical signiﬁcance. Moreover, the total impact of DIF on\nbetween-group score diﬀerences was relatively low, on average\nsumming to a less-than-one point diﬀerence on a 68-point scale\n(UETSDS = 0.722, ETSSD = 0.053). As this was within the\namount of DTF that we deemed ignorable in practice (i.e., |\nETSSD| <0.1), we concluded that the DVMSQ is approximately\ninvariant according to autism status. DIF was also evaluated\nwithin the Proliﬁc sample with respect to age group ( <30 years\nold vs.\u001530 years old), sex (female vs. male), and education level\n(any college degree vs. “some college” or less). No statistically\nsigniﬁcant DIF was found according to age (all pFDR>0.169; all\n| ESSD| <0.387) or education level (all pFDR>0.607; all | ESSD|\n<0.192), although practically signiﬁcant DIF between males\nand females was observed for item 12 (ESSD = 0.650). However,\nas in the case of DIF by diagnostic group, the degree of DTF by\nsex was less than one DVMSQ scale point (UETSDS = 0.420,\nETSSD = 0.040) and was deemed small enough to not result in\na practically signiﬁcant amount of bias. Thus, based on these\nresults, the DVMSQ was judged to be approximately invariant\nacross age, sex, education level, and diagnostic status.\nValidity testing\nZero-order correlations between the DVMSQ scales and\nexternal variables of interest are presented in Table 7 . Notably,\nthe DVMSQ total score correlated very highly with the\nDMQ-SS score in both the full sample ( r= 0.802, CI 95%\n[0.783, 0.820]) and the S1 Positive sample ( r= 0.855, CI 95%\n[0.835, 0.872]), strongly supporting the convergent validity\nof these two measures. Although most observed correlations\nwere similar in magnitude to our predictions, correlations\nbetween all DVMSQ scores and non-misophonia forms of\ndecreased sound tolerance (i.e., the IHS-LOUD and DSM-\nSP) were substantially larger than expected, and correlations\nbetween the DVMSQ scores and the RLSS were somewhat\nsmaller than expected. When statistically comparing correlation\ncoeﬃcients, the DVMSQ total score was more strongly\ncorrelated with the DMQ-SS than either the IHS-LOUD score\n(Whole Sample: 1r= 0.192, CI 95% [0.165, 0.222]; DVMSQ-\ncomplete Sample: 1r= 0.175, CI 95% [0.143, 0.210]) or the\nDSM-SP score (Whole Sample: 1r= 0.204, CI 95% [0.177,\n0.233]; DVMSQ-complete Sample: 1r= 0.153, CI 95% [0.124,\n0.185]), providing modest evidence of divergent validity despite\nthe relatively high correlations with measures of hyperacusis\nand misophonia. This same pattern of correlation diﬀerences\nwas present for the DVMSQ symptom score but not the\nDVMSQ impairment score ( Table 7 ), suggesting that the\nlatter score does not necessarily diﬀerentiate impairment\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org"

Examining DVMSQ\nresponses from over 2,000 autistic and non-autistic adults, we\niteratively tested and subsequently replicated the latent structure\nof the questionnaire, which was found to be approximately\ninvariant according to autism status, age group, sex, and\nlevel of education. Model-based reliability of the DVMSQ\ntotal score was high, and the pattern of correlations between\nthe DVMSQ and other related variables strongly supported\nits construct validity as a measure of misophonia severity\nand impairment. Although further studies are needed to\nestablish the diagnostic eﬃciency (e.g., sensitivity, speciﬁcity,\nand positive/negative predictive values), temporal stability, and\nsensitivity-to-change of this measure, initial psychometric data\non the DVMSQ support its use as a measure of misophonia\nsymptoms and impairment in both general population adults\nand adults on the autism spectrum. The revised DVMSQ\nform is freely available for use and can be found in\nSupplementary Material .\nBy incorporating the recent consensus deﬁnition of\nmisophonia (Swedo et al., 2022) into our DVMSQ-based\ndiagnostic algorithm, this study represents the ﬁrst attempt\nto operationalize the misophonia consensus deﬁnition intoa formal set of diagnostic criteria to be applied in research\nor clinical practice (Williams, 2022). Using the DVMSQ\nalgorithm to deﬁne misophonia caseness, the prevalence of\nclinically signiﬁcant misophonia was 7.3% (102/1403) in a\nsex-balanced crowdsourced sample from Proliﬁc and 35.5%\n(332/936) in a female-predominant sample of independent\nautistic adults recruited from the SPARK cohort. An additional\n10% of each sample (i.e., 144 adults in the Proliﬁc sample\nand 97 adults in the SPARK sample) met DVMSQ criteria\nfor “subclinical misophonia” (i.e., misophonia symptoms\nabove the clinical threshold but without signiﬁcant functional\nimpairment).

Moreover, 29 of 31 individuals in the current\nstudy who had previously received clinical diagnoses of\nmisophonia (93.5%) were ﬂagged by the DVMSQ as meeting\nall misophonia symptom criteria necessary for a diagnosis,\nproviding further evidence to support the validity of the\nscreening algorithm.\nThis study was also the ﬁrst to examine the prevalence\nand features of misophonia in a sample of autistic adults,\na clinical population that anecdotally reports high rates of\nmisophonia-like symptoms (Landon et al., 2016; Scheerer et al.,\n2021; Williams et al., 2021c) but that has not previously been\nsystematically studied using validated misophonia symptom\nmeasures. Based on the DVMSQ criteria, clinically signiﬁcant\nmisophonia was present in slightly over one-third of our\nSPARK sample (44.2% of autistic females and 20.5% of\nautistic males), a rate substantially higher than that found\nin the general population Proliﬁc sample. Notably, autistic\nindividuals have been largely excluded from misophonia\nresearch to date (though see Haq et al., 2021; Tonarely-\nBusto et al., 2022), potentially due to prior iterations of\nmisophonia diagnostic criteria attempting to diﬀerentiate\nmisophonia from other forms of decreased sound tolerance\noften observed in autism (Schröder et al., 2013; Jager et al.,\n2020). Though a substantial majority of individuals with\nclinically signiﬁcant misophonia are likely non-autistic (e.g.,\nonly 7 of 102 in our Proliﬁc sample [6.9%] reported a\nformal autism diagnosis), our data demonstrate that many\nautistic individuals meet full criteria for misophonia, and\nthat most of these individuals (around 85%) report “classic”\noronasal sounds as among their speciﬁc triggers. Furthermore,\nempirical analyses of the DVMSQ found that the structure of\nmisophonia symptoms does not diﬀer meaningfully between\nautistic and non-autistic adults, with practically ignorable\namounts of DTF between groups. These data suggest that\nmisophonia associated with autism is not a qualitatively\ndiﬀerent entity from misophonia in non-autistic individuals,\nproviding empirical support for the idea that misophonia\nshould be considered a separate diagnostic entity in autistic\nindividuals rather than being attributed to autism-associated\nsensory reactivity (Swedo et al., 2022). Though misophonia\nis likely less prevalent than hyperacusis in autistic individuals\n(Williams et al., 2021e; Carson et al., 2022), both disorders\nappear to contribute substantially to the overall burden of\ndecreased sound tolerance in the autistic population, arguably\nwarranting additional attention within autism research and\nspecialist autism clinics. As the DVMSQ is the ﬁrst measure\nof misophonia symptoms and impairment validated for use\nin the autistic population, autism researchers and clinicians\ntreating autistic adults may ﬁnd this measure particularly\nuseful for understanding the misophonia phenotype in autismand monitoring the success of treatments aimed at reducing\nmisophonia symptoms.\nWhen examining the latent structure of the DVMSQ,\nwe found that the scale’s items conformed to a bifactor\nstructure with speciﬁc dimensions of anger/aggression,\ndistress/avoidance, impairment, and global impact. Notably,\nthe ﬁnal measurement model excluded three of the original\n20 DVMSQ items, namely (a) panic or fear in response to\ntrigger stimuli, (b) perceptions of one’s misophonic reactions\nas being excessive or unreasonable, and (c) impairment in\none’s ability to concentrate. With regard to the fear/panic\nitem, it is notable that this item was endorsed at substantially\nlower rates than other emotional responses thought to be\nmore typical of misophonia (i.e., irritation/annoyance, anger,\nand disgust). Furthermore, the fear/panic item was not\nassigned to either symptom-related community in the EGA,\nsuggesting that it represented a latent construct separate from\nanger/aggression and distress/avoidance. This ﬁnding is in\nconcordance with the large study of Jager et al. (2020), which\nfound that despite individuals with misophonia reporting\nanticipatory anxiety surrounding triggers, none reported that\nthe triggers themselves evoked feelings of fear or anxiety\nin the same manner that they evoked anger and/or disgust.\nAlthough the item assessing fear/panic was removed from\nthe DVMSQ total score, we chose to retain it in the revised\nDVMSQ questionnaire in order to capture information about\nthese emotions that may be relevant in deciding whether an\nindividual has misophonia, phonophobia, or a combination\nthereof. The other two items excluded from the measurement\nmodel were both removed from the questionnaire, as neither\nwas judged to contribute meaningful diagnostic information\non its own in the way that the fear/panic item does. Since\nthe collection of the data in the current study, the text of the\ninitial DVMSQ “screening” item has also been modiﬁed to\ncontain the following clarifying text: “ These sounds should cause\nsigniﬁcant emotional distress (e.g., extreme irritation, anger,\ndisgust, rage, anxiety, or panic). Do NOT count sounds that\nbother you only because you ﬁnd them too loud or physically\npainful. ” Though this version of the DVMSQ screening\nquestion has not been empirically tested, we believe that\nthis clarifying text will be helpful in increasing the measure’s\nspeciﬁcity for misophonia (i.e., eliminating false-positive “Yes”\nresponses due to hyperacusis) without lowering its sensitivity\nfor persons with misophonia who would have otherwise\nresponded aﬃrmatively to that initial question. Full text of the\nupdated DVMSQ and scoring guidelines can be found in the\nSupplementary Material .\nThe present study also investigated the construct validity\nof the DVMSQ and its component scores by examining\ncorrelations between these measures and (a) another\npsychometrically validated misophonia questionnaire\n(the DMQ), (b) measures of other forms of decreased\nsound tolerance (the IHS-LOUD and DSM-SP , measuring\nFrontiers in Psychology 17 frontiersin.org"

Correlations between the DMVSQ and\nthe DMQ-SS were exceptionally high ( rs>0.8 for the DVMSQ\ntotal score and rs>0.7 for the symptom/impairment scores),\nsupporting the convergent validity of these two misophonia\nseverity measures in the general population (Carlson and\nHerdman, 2012). Correlations with other DMQ-derived\nmeasures, including the number of trigger categories, the\nfrequency of trigger exposure, and the impact on one’s life,\nwere lower but still in the moderate-to-large (0.4–0.65) range,\nsuggesting that these aspects of misophonia are separable but\nrelated constructs. The DVMSQ also correlated with measures\nof anxiety, depression, anger, and somatic symptom burden\nin a way similar to our hypotheses. However, contrary to our\npredictions, misophonia symptoms did not correlate more\nstrongly with anger than with other forms of emotional distress\nor somatic symptoms. Correlations between the DVMSQ scores\nand quality of life were also slightly smaller than predicted,\nalthough all were non-zero and in the anticipated direction.\nNotably, discriminant correlations between the\nDVMSQ and other measures of non-misophonia decreased\nsound tolerance (i.e., the IHS-LOUD and the DSM-SP)\nwere unexpectedly high, particularly for the DVMSQ\nimpairment score. Though the DVMSQ total and symptom\nscores demonstrated signiﬁcantly stronger correlations\nwith measures of misophonia symptoms as opposed to\nhyperacusis/phonophobia symptoms, this was not the case for\nthe DVMSQ impairment score, which shared similar amounts\nof variance with the measures of misophonia, hyperacusis,\nand phonophobia symptoms. This ﬁnding suggests that the\n“misophonia-related impairment” domain of the DVMSQ\nlikely measures more general impairment due to all types\nof decreased sound tolerance. Although the diﬀerential\ncorrelations between measures of decreased sound tolerance\ndo provide some evidence of discriminant validity for the\nDVMSQ total and symptom scores, measures of “misophonia\nsymptoms” in the general population may potentially be\nsubstantially confounded by other forms of decreased sound\ntolerance such as hyperacusis or phonophobia. Given these\nresults, we strongly recommend that all putative measures\nof misophonia or other sound tolerance disorder symptoms\nbe demonstrated to correlate more strongly with other\nmeasures of the same symptom domain than with measures\nof phenomenologically diﬀerent symptoms. Otherwise,\nresearch on misophonia risks conﬂating misophonia with\nmore broadly deﬁned decreased sound tolerance, potentially\nleading to incorrect conclusions about the most eﬀective\ndiagnostic/screening methods for misophonia or the overlap\nof misophonia with other sound tolerance disorders such as\nhyperacusis and phonophobia. Future research is, therefore,\nmuch needed to determine the most appropriate ways topsychometrically distinguish diﬀerent forms of decreased\nsound tolerance from one another, particularly when using\nself-report questionnaires.\nThis investigation has a number of strengths, including a\nlarge and diverse sample of autistic and non-autistic adults;\nrigorous data-quality checks to ensure valid survey responses;\nclinical characterization that included additional measures\nof misophonia, hyperacusis, phonophobia, psychopathology,\nand somatic symptoms; conﬁrmation of dimensionality with\nestablished and novel methods; sophisticated bifactor latent\nvariable models with out-of-sample model ﬁt assessment;\nand robust tests of diﬀerential item and test functioning\nacross multiple subpopulations. However, it is not without\nlimitations. Most notably, there was no interview-based “gold-\nstandard” used to determine misophonia status, and we\nwere therefore unable to report on the criterion-related\nvalidity or diagnostic eﬃciency (e.g., sensitivity, speciﬁcity,\npositive/negative predictive values) of the DVMSQ diagnostic\nalgorithm in either sample. Future work is, thus, necessary\nto determine whether the DVMSQ algorithm is calibrated\nappropriately to screen for misophonia that rises to the level of\nclinical signiﬁcance as judged by a trained clinician interviewer.\nIn addition, the consensus deﬁnition-based diagnostic criteria\nused by our team were created after DVMSQ data were\ncollected; consequently, the DVMSQ did not encompass all\naspects of the condition mentioned in the consensus deﬁnition\n(e.g., “indirect” forms of avoidance such as altering others’\n“triggering” behavior; Cowan et al., 2022). Future versions of the\nDVMSQ and other criterion-based misophonia screening tools\nshould, therefore, be developed to fully capture the features of\nmisophonia as reﬂected in the current diagnostic criteria or any\nmore rigorously developed consensus criteria that are proposed\nin the literature. Another limitation of the current study was\nits cross-sectional design, as this precluded any analyses of the\ntest-retest reliability of the DVMSQ total or subscale scores,\nthe temporal stability of DVMSQ misophonia classiﬁcation,\nor assessment of DIF across multiple administrations. As\nsuch, additional studies are needed to assess these properties\nof the measure, particularly if researchers are interested\nin using the DVMSQ to quantify change in misophonia\nsymptoms due to treatments such as cognitive-behavioral\ntherapy (Jager et al., 2021) or pharmacological interventions\n(Webb, 2022). Additional IRT-based psychometric analyses,\nsuch as determining the level of latent misophonia severity\nthat can be measured precisely by the DVMSQ and validating\nscoring algorithms that diﬀerentially weight each item from the\nmeasure represent worthwhile future directions. Finally, despite\npromising data in the general population and independent\nautistic adults, the DVMSQ has not yet been validated for use in\nadolescents, autistic adults with intellectual disabilities, or other\nclinical populations of interest, and further research is warranted\nto determine whether this measure is appropriate to assess\nmisophonia in these groups.

Independent replication of the latent\nstructure of the revised DVMSQ in general-population datasets\nwould also be informative regarding the structure of the items\nin the context of the new screening item clariﬁcation text and\nthe removal of two additional Likert items from the original\nscale.\nConclusion\nThe DVMSQ is a novel self-report measure of misophonia\nsymptoms and associated functional impairment designed\nto capture the core aspects of this disorder and to assign\nmisophonia caseness according to a theory-based diagnostic\nalgorithm. Based on initial psychometric testing of the DVMSQ\nin over 2,000 adult participants, the measure demonstrates\na robust and replicable latent structure, adequate reliability\nand construct validity, and practically ignorable diﬀerential\nitem and test functioning between autistic and non-autistic\nadults. The DVMSQ total score can be used as a global\nsummary measure of misophonia symptoms and impairment,\nand separate symptom and impairment subscale scores are also\navailable to investigate these two aspects of the misophonia\nconstruct. Despite encouraging preliminary psychometric data,\nfurther research is needed to independently validate these\nﬁndings and extend them to other measurement properties (e.g.,\ntest-retest reliability and diagnostic eﬃciency) and respondent\npopulations (e.g., adolescents, individuals with intellectual\ndisability). However, in light of these initial data, we believe\nthat the DVMSQ represents a promising measure of misophonia\nfor use in research and clinical practice, particularly when\nassessing the features of misophonia seen in adults on the\nautism spectrum. As the ﬁeld of misophonia research is\nrapidly growing and changing, additional revisions of this\nscale will undoubtedly be necessary as the very deﬁnition of\nmisophonia is revised and updated to more accurately capture\nthe lived experiences of individuals with this poorly understood\ndisorder.\nData availability statement\nThe names of the repository/repositories and accession\nnumber(s) can be found below: the general population (Proliﬁc)\ndataset analyzed for this study can be downloaded from the\nOpen Science Framework at https://osf.io/y6edb/.
