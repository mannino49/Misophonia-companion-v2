      "text": "MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   3 \n \nMisophonia is associated with heightened emotion evocation in music  \nYou hear your friend sniffling next to you and are instantly enraged. Your coworker is \ntapping their pen on the table during a meeting, and your physiological stress response  is \nactivated. You avoid eating dinner with your family, so you don’t have to hear them chewing. In \nhuman auditory processing, the response to everyday sounds , such as chewing, breathing, or \nkeyboard tapping typically garners little attention. But for some individuals  with misophonia , \nthese everyday sounds can turn into a cacophonous ni ghtmare, invoking a visceral and \nuncontrollable negative response.  \nMisophonia  is a condition where  individuals experience  an exceptionally  strong negative \nemotional response  (e.g., anger, anxiety)  to specific “trigger” sounds  or stimuli associated with \nsuch sound s (for review see Brout et al., 2018; Potgieter et al., 2019) . These negative responses \ndo not seem to be elicited by general psychoa coustic  features of a sound (e.g.,  loudness , \nroughness ), but rather  by the specific meaning to an individual (Swedo et al., 2022) . Trigger \nsounds tend to be repetitive and generated by the body ( e.g., orofacial sounds ); however , any \nsound in principle could serve as a trigger for someone with misophonia. Although the \nmechanisms underlying misophonia are still debated (e.g., see Palumbo et al., 2018) , one \npossibility is that affective  brain  networks are  in a heightened state of excitation  in response to \nauditory input  amon g individuals with misophonia  (Møller, 2011) . In support of this framework, \nKumar et al. (2017)  found heightened activity  and altered functional connectivity of the anterior \ninsular cortex  – a core component of the salience network  - among individuals with misophonia  \nwhen  listen ing to trigger sounds . \nMisophoni a is distinct from other auditory processing conditions, such as  hyperacusis, \nwhich is characterized by physical discomfort or pain upon hearing  sounds at a level of loudness"

Unlike misophonia, hyperacusis is \nnot confined to specific trigger sounds but encompasses a wide array of everyday noises, often \nrendering even moderate  decibel  sounds unbearably loud and uncomfortable for those \nexperiencing it. While auditory disorders, including hyperacusis, are often comorbid with \nmisophonia (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) , it is worth noting that the field of audiology \ngenerally classifies misophonia as a subtype of hyperacusis, rather than a distinct disorder (Tyler \net al., 2014) . The potential link between experiencing misophonia and hyperacusis remains \nunclear. It is theorized that distressing hyperacusis might amplify anxiety and depression, \nheightening an individual's likelihood of developing a strong reaction to trigger sound s, as seen \nin misophonia (Aazh et al., 2022) . Alternatively, hyperacusis could potentially divert an \nindividuals' attention, preventing them from attending to potentially bothersome misophonic \ntrigger sounds (Aazh et al., 2022) . The relationship between misophonia and hyperacusis thus \nremains uncertain. There is no clear indication of whether the likelihood of experiencing \nmisophonia is associated with hyperacusis. It is important to note that previous studies have not \nthoroughly examined the relationship between the impact of hyperacusis and t he presence of \nmisophonia. However, a study by Aazh et al.  (2022)  identified that among a population seeking \nassistance from an audiology clinic for tinnitus  (a perceived ringing or buzzing sound that does \nnot have an external source)  and/or hyperacusis, 23% were classified as  also having misophonia.  \nInitially, misophonia was not thought to be associated with psychopathology (Jastreboff \n& Jastreboff, 2014) . However , accumulating research shows that the condition is associated with \nelevated anxiety and stress -related  symptoms, as well as increased co -occurrence with anxiety \ndisorders, post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),  autism spectrum disorder (ASD), mood \ndisorders , and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (Abramovitch et al., 2024; Erfanian et al.,"

Research has even found genetic correlations between misophonia \nand psychiatric personalities/disorders including major depression disorder, PTSD, generalized \nanxiety disorder, and neuroticism (Smit et al., 2023) . Neuroticism is the tendency to experience \nfrequent and intense negative emotions in response to various sources of stress. The responses \ninclude anxiety, irritability, anger, and the experience of anxious or depressive moods (Barlow et \nal., 2014) . Anger and anxiety are common emotional responses to misophonic triggers  (McKay \net al., 2018) , suggesting  that neuroticism could be useful in understanding misophonia. It has \nbeen suggested that neuroticism may be a potential vulnerability factor for misophonia, as \nneurotic individuals may be prone to developing misophonic reactions to sounds they find \naversi ve (Cassiello -Robbins et al., 2020) .  \nLess is known about misophonia as it relates to musicianship and music processing, \nalthough there is some evidence that active musicians experience higher noise sensitivity than \nnon-musicians (Franěk, 2009; Jansen et al., 2009) . Although there ar e anecdotal accounts of \nmusicians who experience misophonia (Kuehn, 2015) , few studies have directly examined \nwhether musicians are more likely than non -musicians to experience misophonia . It is evident \nthat musicians differ from non -musicians in their response to both musical and non -musical \nsounds, particularly affective sounds. There is overwhelming evidence that musicians process \nfundamental musical components such as pitch, melody, timbr e, chords, and musical rhythm \nmore efficiently than non -musicians (Franěk et al., 1991; Matthews et al., 2016; Rammsayer et \nal., 2012; Repp, 2010) . Musicians also outperform non -musicians in recognizing emotion \nconveyed through music, and they have more consistent, rapid, and intense experiences with \nboth positive and negative musical emotion (Akkermans et al., 2019; Castro & Lima, 2014; Park \net al., 2014; Steinbeis et al., 2006) . Musicians have been shown to have stronger emotional"

In summary, musicians differ from non -musicians in their \nemotional responses to both musical and non -musical sounds ; thus, if individuals higher in \nmisophonia symptomology are also more likely to be musicians, this could be one poten tial \nexplanation for why individuals with misophonia might experience heightened emotional \nresponses to music.  \nEven if misophonia is not associated with greater amounts of musical training , there are \nother reasons to expect that misophonia might relate to the emotional processing of music.  If \nmisophonia is characterized by  altered auditory -limbic connections , as has been suggested  (e.g.,  \nJastreboff & Jastreboff, 2023) , then individuals experiencing misophonia might demonstrate \naltered (heightened) affective responses to positive sounds , such as  music . In support of th is idea, \nrecent work has found a positive correlation between  video -induced misophonic experiences and \nfrisson  reactions  to music  (“chills” or “goosebumps”) , indicating that listeners who experience \ngreater misophonic reactions a lso have increased  physiological reactions associated with emotion \nprocessing  in the context of music (Mednicoff et al., 2023) . These authors also fin d positive \nassociations between misophonic experiences and autonomous sensory meridian response \n(ASMR) , which is commonly described as a  pleasant  tingling sensation  across the  head or back \nof the neck in response to certain auditory stimuli (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018) . These studies \nsuggest that individuals with more severe misophonia symptoms may experience overall \nheightened associations between sounds and affect , regardless of positive or negative valence."

First, participants had to pass both \nattention checks. Second, participants could not have completed the entire survey in under two \nminutes, as this represented a completion time that was over twice as fast as the average \ncompletion time of 4 minutes and 26 seconds , and  was considered by the researchers to represent \nan insufficient amount of time to thoroughly read the  prompts and response options of the A -\nMISO -S. The third consideration was that participants could not have skipped questions,  as this  \neither  invalidated the calculation of their misophonia score or did not allow for proper \ndemographic comparisons across the constructed misophonia groups.

The present study \nfinds several factors are associat ed with misophonia, including  musicality, emotion evocation \nfrom music,  sound sensitivity,  language perception,  personality, autism traits, and symptoms \nrelated to PTSD, anxiety , and depression . These findings  support the conceptualization of \nmisophonia as a multifaceted construct  with both positive and negative associations . \nAs hypothesized, individuals with misophonia reported greater active engagement with \nmusic, greater amounts of musical training , and stronger emotion evocation from music . This \nsuggests that individuals with misophonia might seek out and engage with music more compared \nto those without misophonia. This  additionally supports the contention that misophonia can \ninvolve heightened affective responses to positive sounds, like music, in addition to negative \ntrigger sounds. Further research could explore whether m usic serves as a distraction, or  coping \nmechanism  to modulate emotional arousal , in individuals with misophonia. The  finding that \nindividuals higher in misophonia  scored higher on the emotion evocation subscale of the BMRQ  \nconceptually supports recent work examining  how misophonia relates to positive emotional \nresponses to sounds, including  musical frisson (Mednicoff et al., 2023)  and is more broadly \naligned with the framework that misophonia is characterized by altered auditory -limbic \nconnections (cf. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2023) .  \nHowever, Mednicoff et al. (2023) also f ound  that misophonia was not related to \nmusicality and was positively associated with ASMR. In the present study, we found that \nmisophonia related to some facets of musicality  (overall musicality scores, active engagement,"

These differing results could be due to differences in study design as well as task \nconstruction. Although the musicality assessment  (Gold -MSI)  was the same in both studies,  \nMednicoff (2023)  used a correlational design (i.e., examining variability in misophonia across \nthe full range of responses) whereas we used a quasi -experimental design (constructing groups of \nindividuals who have low and high misophonia e xperiences). If musicality is related to \nmisophonia in a non -linear manner, this could potentially explain why we found associations \nbetween misophonia and musicality and Mednicoff et al. (2023)  did not. With respect to ASMR, \nthe present study differed from Mednicoff et al. (2023)  by only assessing ASMR using a single \nitem, self -report measure. In contrast, Mednicoff et al. (2023)  played ASMR -inducing videos to \nindividuals and examined self -reported emotional responses. Thus, it is possible that individuals \nhigh in misophonia might expect to dislike ASMR videos  (particularly given that the source of \nthe sounds can be orofacial, such as whispering)  but ultimately deriv e emotional enjoyment from \nthem when experiencing  them. Nevertheless, these divergent findings highlight the need for \nfurther  researc h to clarify  the underlying mechanisms of misophonia , ASMR , and musical frisson \ngiven  that there m ight be some overlap or interaction between the sensory process es involved in \nthese phenomena.  \nParticipants in the high misophonia group reported  hypersensitivity to sound and greater \naversion to specific words compared to participants in the low misophonia group.  Specifically, \nfunctional, social, and emotional hyperacusis handicaps were significantly elevated  in the high \nmisophonia group. This suggests that individuals with misophonia experience not only \nheightened aversion to specific trigger sounds , but also significant impairments in daily \nfunctioning, social interactions, and emotional well -being due to their sensitivity to sound."

Engaging in thoughts or imaginings involving \nverbalization often conjures images of forming words, a process that inherently involves the \norofacial region, potentially leading to negative associations for those with misophonia. For the \ntrigger words, this suggests that the mere anticipati on of encountering a trigger, can sometimes \nsuffice to elicit a response on its own. This suggests that the anticipation of discomfort or \naversion can itself serve as a trigger, underscoring the complex interplay between cognitive \nprocesses, sensory experi ences, and emotional responses. In terms of the control words, an \nexamination of discourse on Reddit (2022) revealed discussions among individuals with \nmisophonia concerning specific letter sounds that evoke aversive responses . This discussion \ninformed the  use of non -food related words ( silk, teal, new ) as control words. Notably, letters \nsuch as \"p,\" \"k,\" and \"s\" emerged as salient triggers within these conversations. This observation \nunderscores the nuanced nature of misophonia, indicating that the condition extends beyond \nconventional triggers such as c hewing or sniffling. The identification of phonetic elements as \ntriggers highlights the potential for misophonia to manifest in response to a broader range of \nstimuli, including linguistic components intrins ic to speech production.
