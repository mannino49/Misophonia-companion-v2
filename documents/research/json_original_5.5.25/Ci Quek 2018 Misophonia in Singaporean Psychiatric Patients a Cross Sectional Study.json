To date,\nmisophonia is still poorly understood. This study aimed to identify factors associated with severity\nof misophonic symptoms in Singaporean psychiatric patients. Ninety-two psychiatric patients were\nrecruited from a large teaching hospital in Singapore in a cross-sectional study. Socio-demographics,\nseverity of depression, anxiety and stress, and severity of misophonic symptoms were analyzed.\nCorrelation analysis showed that anxiety, depression, and stress scores—as measured by the\nDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21)—were signiﬁcantly positively correlated with\nthe Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) scores. After adjustment for confounding factors,\nmultivariate regression analysis showed that anxiety ( \f= 0.385, p= 0.029) remained signiﬁcantly\nassociated with A-MISO-S. Age, gender, depression, and stress were not signiﬁcantly associated with\nthe severity of misophonia. The ﬁndings showed that the severity of anxiety was associated with\nseverity of misophonia in Singaporean psychiatric patients. Further research is needed to explore the\nnature of misophonia and its relationship with other psychiatric disorders.\nKeywords: misophonia; selective sound sensitivity syndrome; sound sensitivity; anxiety; depression\n1. Introduction\nMisophonia—literally “hatred of sound” and also known as selective sound sensitivity\nsyndrome—is characterized by an intense dislike of speciﬁc sounds and is accompanied by distressing\nemotional and physical reactions [ 1,2]. Recently, this condition has been expanded to include sights\nand images sufferers see that can provoke similar reactions [ 3]. These stimuli are termed “triggers”\nby sufferers and are highly speciﬁc. Examples of auditory triggers described include chewing, low\nfrequency bass sounds, pen clicking, and typing [ 2], while visual triggers described include pointing\nof ﬁngers, legs jiggling, and the twirling of hair [ 4]. After an in-depth study into triggers and reactions\nof 26 misophonics by Dozier and Morrison [ 3], the authors concluded that the severity of misophonic\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

[ 2] demonstrated that misophonics increases skin conductance responses in response to\nauditory triggers, leading to the conclusion that a heightened autonomic response to triggers may be\npresent in sufferers.\nStudies into the nature of misophonia have been inconclusive [ 5], although it is evident that\nmisophonia causes major functional impairment in sufferers [ 6]. Given the prevalence of trigger\nsounds, which is inevitable in modern society, and the rising number of self-identiﬁed misophonia\nsufferers in online support groups, it is imperative that this condition garner more attention among\nresearchers and clinicians alike.\nMisophonia has been described in the literature possibly as part of a psychiatric disorder [ 6]\nor as a separate entity with its own set of psychopathology [ 7,8]. A recent large-scale online study\nof more than 300 misophonia sufferers conducted by Rouw and Erfanian [ 9] found post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) to be associated with the severity of misophonia. A study in Amsterdam\nof 42 self-reported misophonics conducted by Schröder et al. in 2013 [ 1] found 52.4% of sufferers\nhad comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). A recent large-scale study of\n483 undergraduates conducted by Wu et al. [ 6] in 2014 found that anxiety and depressive symptoms\nwere correlated with misophonia symptoms. However, it remains unclear if studies done in other\ncountries can be extrapolated to the local Singaporean context. To expand on this ﬁnding, the aim of\nthis study was to investigate factors associated with the severity of misophonia in psychiatric patients\nin Singapore.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThe methodology adopted in this study is based on a previous cross-sectional study conducted\nby Ho et al. [10].\n2.1. Recruitment of Patients\nThe study was approved by the Domain Speciﬁc Review Board (DSRB) of National University\nHospital (reference number: 2016/01377; approval period: 14 February 2017 to 13 February 2018).\nPatients were recruited from the outpatient psychiatric clinic at the National University Hospital\nlocated in Singapore from 14 February 2017 to 13 February 2018. Patients over the age of 21 were\nrecruited. These patients were not preselected based on whether they self-reported misophonic\nsymptoms. The exclusion criteria of this study were patients with severe cognitive deﬁcits (e.g., learning\ndisability and dementia) and those showing evidence of alcohol and/or drug abuse. All patients\nrecruited gave written informed consent before their participation in the study.\n2.2. Demographics and Data Collection\nSocio-demographic and clinical data were obtained from patients’ medical records and clinical\ninterviews with the research assistant. This included age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and primary\ndiagnosis at time of interview.\n2.3. Assessment of Psychiatric Status\nPsychiatric evaluation was assessed with the self-rated Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales 21\n(DASS-21) in the presence of a research assistant during the clinical interview. The DASS-21 consisted\nof three 7-items, self-report subscales that quantiﬁed the severity of the patients’ depression, anxiety,\nand stress over the past week. The DASS-21 was validated to reliably assess these three dimensions in\nclinical and nonclinical groups [11]."

Assessment of Misophonia Severity\nThe severity of the patients’ misophonia was assessed with the self-rated Amsterdam Misophonia\nScale (A-MISO-S), which was developed by Schroder et al. based on the Yale–Brown Obsessive\nCompulsive Scale. It was developed after the authors studied 42 patients who reported they had\nmisophonia [1]. To date, the scale has not been validated.\nBefore completing the A-MISO-S, the research assistant educated the patients on what\nmisophonia is and gave examples of the emotional reactions (e.g., anger, fear) and physical reactions\n(e.g., palpitations, muscle tension) sufferers might experience [3].\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package program version 24.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, values were expressed as mean \u0006SD.\nCorrelations among the continuous variables were studied using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (r).\nWhen the data did not conform to a normal distribution, non-parametric Spearman’s rank correlation\ntest was used. Using the A-MISO-S score as the dependent variable, univariate and multivariate linear\nregressions were performed to identify factors associated with severity of misophonia. The validity of\nthe regression model was ascertained by a tolerance test and analyses of residuals. The tolerance test\nwas adopted to detect multicollinearity of the confounding independent variables and a value of >0.6\nwas accepted. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p< 0.05.\n3. Results\n3.1. Demographics\nThe demographic features of the patients are illustrated in Table 1. Ninety-eight patients were\ninvited, and 92 of them gave their consent to participate (93.9% response rate). The mean age was\n39.85 \u000613.26 years. The majority of the patients were Chinese (82.6%). At the time of the interview,\nthe most prevalent primary diagnoses of the patients were depression (52.2%), schizophrenia, (22.2%)\nand anxiety disorders (12.2%).\nTable 1.

Misophonic Symptoms in Anxiety Disorders\nOur result showed that the severity of anxiety in psychiatric patients was associated with\nthe severity of misophonia symptoms. This is consistent with Wu et al.’s [ 6] 2014 study which\nfound that misophonia is correlated with anxiety and that anxiety is a signiﬁcant mediator between\nmisophonia symptoms and rage. The pathology of anxiety may mean that sufferers become more\nsensitive and hyper-aware to their environment due to hypothesized dysfunction of the locus\ncoerulus-noradrenaline-sympathetic nervous system [ 12]. Hence, it could be possible that misophonia\nis a consequence of their state of anxiety. The challenge for clinicians then would be to determine\nwhether the misophonic symptoms are on a background of a patient’s underlying anxiety disorder or\na standalone occurrence with no underlying psychiatric comorbidity.\nMisophonia symptoms also co-occur in patients with other psychiatric disorders, such as\nOCPD and mood disorders, as found by Schroder et al. [ 1]. However, this study was limited by\na small sample size and the lack of inter-rater reliability for psychiatric diagnostic assessment [ 5].\nHence, further research should explore the relationship between these psychiatric disorders and\nmisophonic symptoms.\n4.2. Factors Not Associated with Severity of Misophonia\nAfter adjusting for confounding factors, our results showed that gender and age were not\nsigniﬁcantly associated with the severity of misophonia symptoms. This is consistent with\nWu et al.’s [ 6] 2014 study of 483 undergraduate students which found no signiﬁcant gender and\nage differences in severity of misophonia symptoms.\nWe found that A-MISO-S was signiﬁcantly positively correlated with the DASS-21 depression\nscore, a ﬁnding comparable to Wu et al.’s study [ 6]. However, after adjusting for confounding factors,\nmultivariate regression revealed that depression as measured by the DASS-21 depression score was no\nlonger signiﬁcantly associated with the severity of misophonia symptoms. This could suggest that\ndepression may not play a role in the psychopathology of misophonia.\nWe also found that A-MISO-S score was not signiﬁcantly associated with the DASS-21 stress\nscore after adjusting for confounding factors. This could be because the DASS-21 stress scale assesses\n“features of both anxiety and depression” [ 11] and hence, the qualities of a patient’s anxiety and\ndepression will be compounded in the stress scale.\n4.3. Strengths and Limitations\nOur study had two main strengths. Firstly, the subjects were recruited from a psychiatric\noutpatient clinic and hence, the study sample should be representative of psychiatric outpatients\nin a large hospital in Singapore. Secondly, the DASS-21 is a brief and validated [ 11] instrument, which\nallowed us to reliably assess the current psychiatric status of patients during the point of interview.\nThis is a better measure than the primary diagnoses of patients, which may not be the most accurate\nrepresentation of mental health as the conditions can be well-controlled under the management plan\nprescribed by psychiatrists.\nNevertheless, our study also had several limitations. Firstly, the DASS-21 is indicative of the\nseverity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms based on the subjects’ self-reports, instead of a\nmore objective and comprehensive clinical interview. Secondly, there was no control (non-psychiatric)\ngroup for the comparison of DASS-21 scores and A-MISO-S scores. The recent large-scale study of\nover 300 misophonia sufferers conducted by Rouw and Erfanian [ 9] found that half of the misophonia\nsufferers reported no clinical comorbidities. Hence, it could be possible that our study was biased\nin selecting for the subgroup of misophonia sufferers with existing comorbidities. Thirdly, other\nfactors such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms [ 6] have also been associated with misophonia, but\nthese factors were not investigated in this study. Fourthly, to date, A-MISO-S has not been validated"

Lastly, as this was a cross-sectional study, the\ncausality between anxiety and misophonia could not be ascertained. Future research should examine\nthis relationship in a longitudinal study. Within the limits of this study, we explored factors that were\nassociated with misophonia in Singaporean psychiatric patients and we hope this can prompt further\nresearch in misophonia in Asian populations.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the severity of anxiety in Singapore psychiatric patients was found to be associated\nwith the severity of misophonic symptoms they experienced. This might offer valuable insights into\nthe psychopathology of misophonia, either as part of a psychiatric disorder or as a yet to be understood\ncondition.
