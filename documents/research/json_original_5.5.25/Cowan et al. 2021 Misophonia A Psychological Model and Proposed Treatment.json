The condition can be debilitating due to the distress and avoidance that it involves, at times resulting in \nsignificant occupational and relational dysfunction. The aim of this paper is to offer a theoretical account that \ncan explain the phenomenology of misophonia that has been reported in the literature. To this end, we argue that \nmisophonia emerges out of a rigid character style in combination with contextual factors and classical and \noperant conditioning processes. Based on this model, we also offer a treatment approach called experiential \nacceptance and stimulus engagement (EASE). It consists of three main components: ending toxic hope, reduction \nof avoidance, and stimulus engagement. .   \nMisophonia is a condition characterized by the experience of intense \nnegative emotions in reaction to specific sounds (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, \n2002 ). The emotional response is often described as strong feelings of \nanger or annoyance towards the source of the sound, which is typically \nanother person. The most common sound triggers are made by the \nmouth and include chewing, crunching, lip-smacking, and sipping. \nFurther, other triggers include repetitive sounds such as foot tapping and \npen clicking (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). While anger is the most commonly \nreported reaction, irritability, annoyance, anxiety, and disgust may also \nbe experienced (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Many sufferers report expe-\nriencing violent urges towards the source of the sound, although rarely \ndo any act on their urges (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Many also report a \nstrong physiological response, including the body tensing up and other \nreflexive behaviors (Dozier et al., 2017 ; Schwartz et al., 2011 ). In-\ndividuals experiencing misophonia describe not only distress upon \nhearing these sounds but also a state of anxious apprehension and \nhypervigilance for future occurrences of the sound (Edelstein et al., \n2013 ). Moreover, these individuals report avoiding places where they \nwill likely encounter unwanted sounds, such as the family dinner table, \nleading in many cases to reduced quality of life and functional impair -\nment (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Indeed, some patients distance themselves \nfrom the people they are closest to, resulting in social isolation \n(Schwartz et al., 2011 ). Patients report often engaging in coping behaviors involving blocking out sounds using headphones and other \ndevices, although these methods are often found to be impractical \n(Frank & McKay, 2019 ). The significant distress and social and occu-\npational dysfunction associated with misophonia make it a public health \nconcern. As yet, however, misophonia has not been categorized as a \ndiscrete disorder for diagnostic purposes, although some have argued \nthat it should receive this status based on the reduced functioning \nassociated with it (Schroder et al., 2013 ). \nThe prevalence rate for misophonia is not yet known despite several \ncalls for additional epidemiological research (Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; \nDozier et al., 2017 ; Taylor, 2017 ). In a study which surveyed 483 un-\ndergraduate students, 22.8% reported that they were “often ” or “al-\nways ” sensitive to specific sounds (Wu et al., 2014 ). In a different \nundergraduate sample (N 336), 49.1% reported significant symptoms \nof misophonia, with 37% reporting mild symptoms, 12% reporting \nmoderate symtoms, and only 0.03% reporting severe symptoms (Naylor \net al., 2020 ). Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2014) estimated that 3.2% of the \npopulation suffers from the condition, which would make it more \ncommon than OCD and related disorders. Misophonia was first recog -\nnized and treated within the context of tinnitus treatment, as high co-\nmorbidity rates have been observed between the two conditions \n(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002 ). Misophonia has been reported to be \ncomorbid with other conditions, as well, such as obsessive-compulsive \n*Corresponding author.

The average age of onset has been consistently reported to \nbe in childhood or adolescence, with symptoms often worsening over \ntime (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). \nCurrently, the etiology of misophonia remains unclear with no \ncomprehensive theoretical framework available to explain the various \nsymptoms associated with the condition. Jastreboff and Jastreboff \n(2002) have offered a neurophysiological model to explain the condi -\ntion, which is discussed explored later in this paper. While under -\nstanding neurophysiological contributors to misophonia symptoms is \nimportant, the growing body of research suggests that there are salient \npsychological variables at play in this condition, which may hold the \nkeys to the development of a comprehensive treatment. The aim of this \npaper is to highlight some of these psychological processes through a \ncritical review of important findings that have emerged in misophonia \nresearch. Through examination of these factors, the paper will offer a \npsychological framework for understanding the development and \nmaintenance of misophonia symptoms. Finally, a treatment approach \nthat follows from this psychological model will be outlined. To achieve \nthese aims, the paper is divided into three sections. The first section will \ncritically review prominent features of misophonia, which we believe \noffer direction for the development of a psychological model. These \nfindings consist of contextual variables often associated with misopho -\nnia and visual triggers for the misophonia response. In the second sec-\ntion, we will suggest a theoretical model for misophonia that \nincorporates these factors, as well as findings that personality-related \nvariables (e.g., rigidity, rule-governed behavior) may play a substan -\ntial role in development of the condition. Lastly, in the third section, a \ntreatment approach will be proposed. Within the treatment section, we \nwill also discuss some of the potential obstacles to misophonia treatment \nand ways to effectively address them. \n1.Misophonia: important findings and questions \nOne intriguing phenomenon consistently reported by the majority of \npatients diagnosed with misophonia is the adverse reaction to sounds \nwhich emanate from specific individuals. Edelstein et al. (2013) found \nthat 82% of their clinical sample (N 11) reported that the sound \ntriggers were localized around certain individuals, often family mem-\nbers. This phenomenon is also reported in almost all of the misophonia \ncase studies (Bernstein et al., 2013 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ; McGuire et al., \n2015 ; Neal & Cavanna, 2013 ). Why, we might ask, would someone be \ntriggered only by one person making the specific sound and not another? \nFurther, even with individuals that experience the same reaction in \nresponse to many people (e.g. family, friends, and strangers), the \nstrength of the response is not the same across all individuals. That an \nindividual develops such a unique reaction to the behavior of specific \nindividuals suggests that there is, at least in part, a context-specific re-\naction and not a general neurological deficit that results with heightened \nsensitivity to specific sounds. Further, individuals with misophonia \nreport they experience no differences in response to sounds that the \ngeneral population find aversive (Kumar et al., 2017 ) indicating that the \nresponse is not a general sensitivity to all sounds, and denoting a \npossible contextual explanation. \nA second finding of importance is that a significant portion of pa-\ntients with misophonia are not only triggered by sounds, but also \nexperience a similar reaction to visual stimuli (Dozier, 2015 ; Edelstein \net al., 2013 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). These include \nrepetitive movements, such as shaking of the leg or other body parts. The \nfact that patients with misophonia report that they experience anger in \nreaction to both auditory and visual triggers leads to questions about the \nimportance of the perceptual source relative to how the individual reacts \nto any stimulus – auditory or visual – in a situation. This is significant as \na substantial portion of the literature on misophonia has viewed the \nproblem as an audiological condition. Indeed, misophonia was first identified by audiologists and assumed to be primarily a hearing-related \nconcern. Yet the phenomenology of the condition appears to be broader \nthan hearing alone. That many individuals who experience anger in the \ncontext of specific sounds also experience it from visual cues suggests \nthat it is something in the interpersonal context that makes these per-\nceptions so deeply bothersome. Any adequate conceptual model of \nmisophonia will need to account for this finding. \nIn summary, there are two findings associated with misophonia \nwhich seem to be vital in further understanding the condition. First, \nmost patients presenting with misophonia report that they respond to \nsounds from specific people, often family members (Edelstein et al., \n2013 ). Second, these individuals report similarly intense negative re-\nactions to both auditory and visual stimuli (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Our \naim in the next section is to develop a psychological model for miso-\nphonia which will address these two points. \n2.A psychological model of misophonia \nWhile there is currently no comprehensive psychological model for \nmisophonia, existing explanations of the phenomenon do include psy-\nchological variables. Some have pointed out that Jastreboff and Jas-\ntreboff ’s (2002) neural mechanism model of misophonia is supported by \nclassical conditioning, given that it postulates that patients with miso-\nphonia have an enhanced connection between their limbic system, \nautonomic nervous system, and auditory system (Palumbo et al., 2018 ). \nAccordingly, anger would be the unconditioned response and the sound \ntriggers acting as the conditioned stimulus (Palumbo et al., 2018 ). Op-\nerant conditioning is also present as exhibited by the avoidance of the \nsounds, which negatively reinforces the association between the nega-\ntive affect and the sound triggers (Palumbo et al., 2018 ). Moreover, \navoidant behaviors and the use of anger expression as stimulus control \nare also negatively reinforced to the extent that they reduce exposure to \nthe aversive sound trigger. \nWhile we agree that classical conditioning is important to under -\nstanding misophonia, we would argue that this specific conceptualiza -\ntion does not fully explain the learning from a Pavlovian perspective. We \nagree that sound triggers serve as the conditioned stimulus and that the \nanger serves as both the unconditioned and conditioned responses . What \nneeds to be clarified, however, is what constitutes the unconditioned \nstimulus in this model. That is, what is the variable which originally \nelicited the anger response which came to be associated with the sound \ntrigger? What makes one person initially respond with anger that would \nestablish the conditions for Pavlovian learning? We believe that the \nunconditioned stimulus in this case pertains to both the relational \ncontext and the psychological profile of patient – specifically, the pa-\ntient ’s personality, cognitions and emotions, and experiential \navoidance. \n2.1. Personality traits \nPsychological factors that can contribute to responding to a neutral \nsound with intense negative emotions include features of the patient ’s \ncharacter (i.e., the style of interpersonal behavior). One potential per-\nsonality trait, which could potentially be related to the development of \nmisophonia, are traits of rigidity, inflexibility, and a strong need for \ncontrol. This is indicated by the high rates of traits of obsessive- \ncompulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and perfectionism found to \nbe associated with misophonia. Prior to reviewing these findings, it is \nmay be useful to offer some background on OCPD and perfectionism. \nThe former is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5 ; American Psychiatric Association [APA], \n2013 ) as a “pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, \nperfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of \nflexibility, openness and efficiency as indicated by four (or more) ” traits \n(p. 678). The DSM-5 lists eight traits associated with OCPD: (a) excessive \npreoccupation with details, (b) task-interfering perfectionism, (c) E.N. Cowan et al."

A subset of individuals \nwith OCPD are typically seen as rigid and overly controlling as they are \nexcessively concerned about doing things the “right ” way (Pinto, 2016 ). \nThey tend to experience significant interpersonal difficulties as a result \nof setting impossibly high standards that can lead to reactions of anger \nand hostility when not met (Pollack, 1987 ). Relatedly, perfectionism is \noften considered a multidimensional construct characterized by a strong \naversion of making mistakes, high personal standards, perception of \nhigh parental expectations and parental criticism, doubting quality of \none’s actions, and a strong preference for order (Frost et al., 1990 ). \nAs indicated above, rigidity and associated traits have been found to \nbe highly prevalent among individuals with misophonia. For example, \nSchroder et al. (2013) found that 52% of their misophonia clinical \nsample (N 42) met full criteria for OCPD. This was the highest co-\nmorbidity rate found in their study, followed by a 7% comorbidity with \nmood disorders. The authors suggested that a potential hypothesis for \nthe etiology of misophonia is that the pattern of behavior found in OCPD \npredisposes misophonia. Further they suggested that “a morally strict \nperson may have difficulties coping with impolite eating sounds, even-\ntually resulting in avoidance. ” In a subsequent study with a significantly \nlarger misophonia clinical sample (N 575), 26% reported traits of \nOCPD (Jager et al., 2020 ). Most notably, they also found that 97% of \ntheir sample reported symptoms of clinical perfectionism . Edelstien et al. \n(2013) found 18% of their sample reporting traits of \nobsessive-compulsive personality. Rouw and Erfanian (2018) , however, \nfound an 8% comorbidity rate. The large disparity between the findings \nare likely due to differences in methodology between the studies. Spe-\ncifically, Schroder et al. (2013) and Jager et al. (2020) conducted full \nstructured interviews, whereas Rouw and Erfanian (2018) asked the \nparticipants to indicate if they had a diagnosis from a list of disorders, \none of which was OCPD. From our clinical observations, individuals \nmeeting criteria for OCPD may not be aware that they demonstrate these \ncharacteristics. Indeed, personality conditions typically require a degree \nof insight to realize that their challenges are related to their personality. \nThat said, 8% still is a notable comorbidity rate despite these method -\nological limitations and is consistent with other findings. Further, across \nall of these studies misophonia had significantly higher comorbidity rate \nwith OCPD traits relative to any other diagnosis. \nRigidity and inflexibility was also reported in all published miso-\nphonia case studies that we are aware of. In a study of three patients \nwith misophonia, all three patients were found to meet full criteria for \nOCPD (Natalini et al., 2019 ). Consistently, all three presented with \nschemas of “unrelenting standards/hypocriticalness. ” In another study, \na 14-year-old female being treated for misophonia was described by her \nparents “as a high achiever with a history of perfectionistic tendencies ” \nwho “showed signs of scrupulosity at a young age, with excessive \nconcern for following rules and not hurting her friends ’ feelings ” (Muller \net al., 2018 ). In a study which reported on two cases, one of the patients \nwas a 29-year-old married female who was described by her husband as \n“meticulous, huffy, ” and “prescriptive ” (Hocaoglu, 2018 ). The authors \nadded that this patient was reported to have a “rigorous, prescriptive, \nand punctual personality since her adolescence. ” Further, on the Min-\nnesota Multiplex Personality Inventory (MMPI), which they adminis -\ntered, they found she “could have a perfectionistic attitude. ” The second \npatient ’s MMPI also yielded this finding. Lastly, Kluckow et al. (2014) \nexplored the relationship between eating disorders and misophonia in \nthree patients. In screening for personality factors, they found that all \nthree patients reported features of OCPD. \nRigidity in misophonia was also indicated in a study which perhaps \ntook the closest look at the relationship between personality and miso-\nphonia (Cassiello-Robins et al., 2021 ). Using both the SCID-I and \nSCID-II, they found in their clinical sample (N 49) that full criteria for \nOCPD was met by 10.2%, 12.2% for borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 8.2% for avoidant personality disorder (APD). Natalini et al. \n(2019) also found in her case study of three patients, at least one met \ncriteria for BPD and one for APD. Both BPD and APD exhibit an avoidant \nand inflexible disposition; while the underlying reasons for avoiding \nmay be different in these conditions (e.g. interpersonal rejection and/or \nabandonment) an inflexible disposition is generally present. \n2.2. Rigidity-related cognitions and emotions in misophonia \nFindings suggesting a relationship between misophonia and rigidity \nare consistent with research related to the cognitions and emotions of \nmisophonia patients. For example, McKay et al. (2018) found that the \ncognitions associated with misophonia are an inflated sense of re-\nsponsibility, perfectionism, and intolerance for uncertainty. Individuals \nwith rigidity often engage in perfectionistic behaviors and hold \nexceedingly high standards for themselves (Pinto, 2016 ), which can \ngenerate an inflated sense of personal responsibility. Holding high and \nrigid standards is also consistent with the finding that the majority of \npatients with misophonia described the trigger sounds as invasive, \nintrusive, insulting, violating, offensive, disgusting, and rude (Edelstein \net al., 2013 ), suggesting that they held an expectation or judgement that \npeople should not make these sounds and that this expectation was \nviolated. Intolerance of uncertainty has also been found to be signifi -\ncantly associated with rigidity (Gallagher et al., 2003 ), and is highly \nconsistent with the environmental and situational control that in-\ndividuals with rigidity seek to exercise. \nThe emotions associated with misophonia are also consistent with \nthe rigid personality profile. As indicated above, common misophonic \nreactions to sounds are anger, annoyance, disgust, and irritability \n(Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002 ). Increased anger \nand irritability are often experienced by individuals with OCPD char-\nacterological features (Pollack, 1987 ). Their high standards and rigid \nexpectations for themselves and their environment may lead to anger \nwhen unwanted or unanticipated events or experiences occur. Consis -\ntent with this, findings indicates that when experiencing lower levels of \nanger, patients are less likely to experience misophonic reactions to their \ntypical triggering sources (Natalini et al., 2019 ). For example, one re-\nported absence of a misophonic reactions from his typical triggering \nsource because he felt guilty about something he did towards that per-\nson. Another example involved a female patient who did not experience \nthe reaction when she felt her husband was affectionate towards her. \n2.3. Experiential avoidance in rigidity \nAnother variable that is likely to play an important role in the \ndevelopment of misophonia is experiential avoidance (EA). A trans -\ndiagnostic construct, EA is defined as an unwillingness to be in contact \nwith unpleasant, uncomfortable, aversive private experiences, including \nbodily sensations, memories, and feelings, as well as engagement in \nbehaviors and actions to evade these unwanted experiences and the \nevents which elicit them (Hayes et al., 1996 ). EA is associated with a \nrange of psychopathology, particularly mood and anxiety disorders \n(Chawla & Ostafin, 2007 ). The basic premise of EA is that it is not the \nexperiencing of the unpleasant stimulus which is problematic but rather \nhow one relates to the experience. Within the context of misophonia this \nappears relevant as individuals often attempt to avoid and rid them -\nselves of the aversive experience associated with the sound triggers. \nEA is believed to play a role in the functional impairment associated \nwith several conditions. For example, in obsessive-compulsive disorder \n(OCD), which typically involves intrusive thoughts that create anxiety \nand are followed by compulsions which function to neutralize the anx-\niety. Unwanted cognitions of this kind are reported to be experienced by \n90% –99% of the general population (Freeston et al., 1991 ; Rachman & \nde Silva, 1978 ). However, only a small segment of the population \n(approximately 2.5%) develops symptoms of OCD, in which affected \nindividuals respond to intrusive thoughts with ritualistic behavior to E.N. Cowan et al."

Models in the OCD literature suggest that \ncompulsions result in part from an unaccepting disposition, and efforts \nto get rid of the intrusive thoughts lead to further distress (Eifert & \nForsyth, 2005). It could be argued that patients with misophonia share \nthe same disposition towards the sounds as those with OCD. Since the \nsounds are unwanted, avoided, and “pushed away,” they are more likely \nto be salient and distressing. This paradoxical condition is similar to the \nwhite bear phenomenon, or the ironic process theory of mental control, \nwhich describes the process by which attempts at thought suppression \nincrease the frequency of the unwanted thoughts (Wegner et al., 1987). \nThe presence of this phenomenon in association with misophonia has yet \nto be explored empirically, however, it does appear to play a role as it \ndoes with OCD (Abramowitz et al., 2001), as well as chronic pain (Burns \net al., 2008) and tinnitus (Hesser et al., 2013). An EA-based conceptu -\nalization of misophonia was suggested by Schneider and Arch (2017) \nand was utilized to successfully treat a misophonia patient using an \nacceptance-based protocol they developed. \n2.4. Theoretical model for misophonia \nWe will now turn to our proposed psychological model for miso-\nphonia. Prior to doing so, it may serve useful to provide a vignette of a \nmisophonia case: \nEmily, a 14-year-old high school freshman, was referred by her \nmother for experiencing an extreme aversion to a range of sounds \nincluding chewing, slurping, yawning, sniffling. When triggered she \nwould experience a strong feeling of anger– at times even rage–towards \nthe person making the sounds. These sounds were particularly triggering \nwhen a family member would emit them, with her mother and sister \neliciting the strongest reactions. Emily would primarily cope by asking \nthe triggering individual to stop making the triggering sound, leaving \nthe room, or generally avoiding situations where the trigger might \noccur. The situation created tension in the household as Emily consis -\ntently asked people to stop producing the trigger sounds, which often led \nto arguments and verbal altercations. Emily also reported that she ten-\nded to worry about the triggers and how she would deal with situations \nwhere she would likely encounterthem. \nEmily was described by her mother as someone who has a tough time \nwith change, especially changing social environments. Starting high \nschool had been a difficult transition from middle school. She exceled in \nschool, but tended toexperience significant stress before exams and \n“berated” herself if she did not get a grade as high as she was expecting. \nSocially she tended to be people pleasing, but also had a tough time \ndealing with friends that did not act in accordance with her expecta -\ntions. She had recently cut off a close friend whom she felt “should have \nbeen more thoughtful” when she wore t-shirt depicting a popular singer \nthat she “can’t stand.” Emily’s father was reported to run the house like a \n“tight ship” and did not easily overlook mistakes or mishaps, often \nexhibiting frustration towards family members that violated his ex-\npected rules such as not taking food outside eating areas or failing to be \npunctual with time. \nEmily stated that she was willing to try therapy when she realized \nthat the triggers were “spreading” to other people outside of her family. \nThis awareness led her to consider that her responses may not stem \nmerely from the behavior of her family members and to acknowledge \nthat she might play a part in the problem. \nAs indicated in the aforementioned literature review, rigidity ap-\npears to be associated with misophonia. In this vignette as well, Emily \nappears to be presenting with some symptoms of rigidity such as her \nexpectation that her friend should follow a rule to not wear a shirt that is \nnot agreeable to her, strict expectations of her own academic success, \nand difficulty with changes to her routine. Based on the possibility that \nrigidity and EA play an active role in the development of misophonia, \nthe following can be proposed as a psychological model of misophonia. \nAs suggested by Schroder et al. (2013), the presence of rigidity pre-\ndisposes the development of misophonia. Rigidity leads to the rejection of specific sound, which results in an emotional reaction of anger. This \nreaction serves as the initial pairing between the sound triggers and \nnegative emotional reactivity. \nRigidity can also explain why individuals with misophonia experi -\nence a negative reaction to the behavior of specific individuals. It is not \nthe sound itself that elicits their reactions but the person emitting the \nsound. Importantly, we believe that there are predisposing events that \ninfluence the negative reaction to this specific person. Being irritated or \nannoyed at a parent, for example, can lead one to be less tolerant of \nthings which would otherwise not be noticed. It is entirely possible to \nimagine a child with perfectionistic traits who is disappointed or \nannoyed at one of her parents, and she became more judgmental and less \ntolerant of unpleasant sounds emitted by this parent. For example, in \nEmily’s case, she has been feeling frustrated towards her mother because \nshe has not supported her decision to cut off her friend, she felt betrayed \nby her mother leaving her feeling anger towards her. Unlike someone \nwho is more flexible, Emily relying on rigid, perfectionistic, and control- \noriented strategies may not habituate to the sound, instead viewing the \nsound as wrong and not “permitting” the sound to be there. \nWith rigidity leading to greater awareness of the sound, the indi-\nvidual finds him or herself hearing a sound that is unwanted. To avoid the \nunwanted sound, he or she can either physically leave the room or \nattempt to ignore the sound, as exemplified in Emily’s case. This \navoidance paradoxically leaves one with even greater awareness of the \nsound, which can lead to further distress and anger. This situation, \nwhich has been described as being “trapped” (Edelstein et al., 2013), \nleaves the individual in an emotional upheaval capable of creating a \nstrong association between the person making the sound and the \nnegative emotions. It is at this point where classical conditioning be-\ncomes relevant, in the following manner: the unconditioned stimulus is \nthe negative interpersonal interactions with a family member (such as \nEmily’s mother who did not support her) which, in combination with \nrigidity, leads to unconditioned response of anger. Specifically, a family \nmember makes a neutral sound (such as chewing) which elicits a \njudgement that the sound is wrong (“why is he/she chewing so loudly?“), \nwhich leads to a response of anger. This affective response subsequently \nbecomes paired with otherwise neutral sounds from that person, making \nthose sounds a conditioned stimulus, which elicits anger as a condi -\ntioned response. Once this connection has been developed, it is also \nreinforced through operant conditioning since the individual avoids the \nsituations in which the specific sounds are often emitted (e.g., meal \ntimes, such as in the case with Emily) or engages in anger expression (e. \ng., criticism) designed to punish (and thereby control) the other person’s \nbehavior. \nEvidence suggests that thinking about the sounds, which occurs \nduring states of hypervigilance and worry, also reinforces the associa -\ntion (Joos et al., 2013). Further, generalization may occur in some in-\nstances, creating associations to similar situations and other sounds. \nGeneralization could extend to other classes of stimuli, too. Visual \nstimuli, for example, can be viewed as unacceptable and lead to the same \nreaction hypothesized with misophonia. Though they may develop from \na similar process, visual stimuli seem to be less often reported as the \nsource of distress. This may be attributable to the fact that it is easier to \navert one’s gaze and avoid looking at something than it is to avoid \nhearing a sound. Generalization, too, can explain how the misophonia \nreaction can be experienced outside of the close family context. That is, \nthe trigger itself becomes associated with aversive sensations and feel-\nings which can be elicited by ones broader context (e.g. school, work) \nwhich can then lead to further avoidance and dysfunction. Thus, the \ndeleterious impact of misophonia can spill over beyond the confines of \nthe original triggering context. However, the strongest reactions to \ntriggers still appear to consistently be reported with those from closer \ninterpersonal relationships. This may be related to the “personal” nature \nof triggers; it is more hurtful when someone who is expected to be caring \nsuch as a family relative or intimate partner, as compared to those who \nare less likely to be held to that expectation. Further, those outside the E.N. Cowan et al."

An unaccepting \ndisposition towards the sounds, ironically, leads to a heightened \nawareness of the sound. Efforts to avoid (both physical and cognitive) \nmay provide temporary relief but also yield a hypervigilant attention to \nthe sound, thus leaving the individual even more acutely aware of the \nsound ’s presence, and less accepting of the sounds. The more awareness \nthere is, the more distressing it is, and thus the more it is resisted. The \nresult is a vicious cycle as the greater awareness of distress around the \nsound, the more rigid one can become about the sounds (Fig. 1). An \nassociation is developed between the sounds and the negative emotion \nof anger, which is then maintained by negative reinforcement, and \nsubsequently can generalize to other sounds and triggering sources \n(including visual stimuli) due to generalization (Fig. 2). \nIt should be noted that there is growing body of evidence suggesting \nthat anxiety may play a role in the etiology of misophonia. For example, \nCassiello Robins et al. (2021) found that anxiety symptoms partially \nmediated the relationship between symptoms of personality disorders \nand symptoms of misophonia. These findings are consistent with our \nmodel as it is possible that the fear of getting triggered can generate a \ngreater effort to attempt to control and avoid the trigger which can, in \nturn, worsen the symptoms of misophonia. Thus, from the perspective of \nthis model, we believe the presence of anxiety is secondary to the initial \ndevelopment and maintenance of the misophonia. Specifically, once the \naforementioned processes are in place, the individual experiences anx-\niety over getting trapped in triggering situation and not having any \nstrategies to cope. A similar example is individuals with OCD who fear \ngetting into a situation where their fear of contamination is triggered \n(such as an important meeting in a restaurant) and they won ’t have the \nability to get away from the situation to conduct a time-consuming \nritual. Besides for the actual problem (OCD) there is an additional fear \n(impaired access to relief). So too, with misophonia, besides for the \nactual problem (misophonia) there is a secondary anxiety (getting \ntrapped with triggers). Importantly, these findings relating to anxiety \nwill have practical implications for the treatment, as we will discuss \nfurther down. 2.5. Misophonia treatments \nThis conceptualization of misophonia is only relevant to the degree it \ncan enhance the efficacy of treatment for the condition. There are \nseveral case studies that reported psychological interventions that were \ndeveloped using existing therapeutic techniques, with many of them \nreporting reductions in misophonia symptoms (Bernstein et al., 2013 ; \nMcGuire et al., 2015 ; Muller et al., 2018 ; Schneider & Arch, 2017 ). \nAlmost half of 90 patients in an open trial showed significant reductions \nin misophonic symptoms (Schroder et al., 2017 ). Frank and McKay \n(2019) found evidence supporting the suitability for utilizing exposure \nstrategies based on an inhibitory learning approach. The interventions \nin these studies primarily consisted of protocols that derived their \ncomponents from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and \ncommitment therapy (ACT), and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). \nThese components included cognitive restructuring (i.e., Bernstein et al., \n2013 ; McGuire et al., 2015 ), exposure and response prevention (ERP; i. \ne., Frank & McKay, 2019 ; McGuire et al., 2015 ; Muller et al., 2018 ), \ncounterconditioning (i.e., Dozier, 2015 ; Frank & McKay, 2019 ; Schroder \net al., 2017 ), relaxation exercises (i.e., Schroder et al., 2017 ), acceptance \nand distress tolerance strategies (i.e., Schneider & Arch, 2017 ), and \nimproving interpersonal communication skills (i.e. Bernstein et al., \n2013 ; Muller et al., 2018 ). Overall, a large emphasis was placed on \nexposure to the sound, a treatment strategy that resembles ERP for OCD \nand anxiety. Indeed, some have argued that misophonia is an OCD \nspectrum condition (Schroder et al., 2013 ), suggesting that \nexposure-based approaches should be useful. \n2.6. Treatment considerations \nWe believe that the structure of ERP is consistent with our proposed \ntreatment for misophonia, though there are very significant differences \nbetween how exposures are applied to misophonia relative to OCD and \nits related conditions. The differences are related to the (1) interpersonal \nnature of misophonia and (2) the primary emotion associated with it \nwhich is consistently reported to be anger. \n2.7. Interpersonal nature of misophonia \nWe believe that the interpersonal element present in misophonia \nalters the structure of the exposures in a qualitative way. In exposure- \nbased interventions that target acceptance of something unwanted (e. \ng., emotion, outcome, sensation, memory), the reduction of symptoms \ntypically follows when one ceases to resist an unwanted experience and \ndevelops a willingness to experience it, to accept it. Importantly, \nacceptance appears to occur when an individual realizes that their ef-\nforts to get rid of pain, anxiety or any unwanted experience is a hopeless \nendeavor, thus leaving one “cornered ” with the choice of either \naccepting one’s experience, or further utilizing unhelpful coping stra-\ntegies that are associated with dysfunction and suffering (Hayes et al., \n2012 ). In order for acceptance to occur there must be qualitative shift in \nhow one relates to the unwanted experiences. It requires a willingness \nand openness to experience the unwanted experience, and the willing -\nness needs to be complete —it’s all or nothing (Hayes et al., 2012 ). If one \nis willing to experience the unwanted experience, acceptance can occur \nand symptoms often subside. For example, in OCD, intrusive thoughts \nare reduced when they are allowed to emerge without attempts to \ncontrol or neutralize them (Craske et al., 2008 ). With chronic pain, too, \nthe pain is less intrusive when attempts to get rid of the pain are ended \nand they are “allowed ” to be there (Dahl et al., 2004 ). \nIf a goal of treating misophonia is for the patient to accept the ex-\nistence of the triggering sounds and associated emotions, the path to \nacceptance appears different than OCD, chronic pain, and other forms of \nunwanted experiences. Misophonia has two core elements that make the \nacceptance process different: the misophonia response is perceived to be \nthe result of (a) someone else making a sound who (b) can choose to stop \nFig. 1.Vicious cycle which contributes to the development and maintenance \nof misophonia.

Within this paradigm, the mere exposure and acceptance of \nthe sounds will not be sufficient because it is not the sounds per se that \nare problematic but the people who are making them. Affected in-\ndividuals can tell themselves that they are willing to accept the sounds, \nbut in the back of their minds they may still be believing that the person \nmaking the sounds can (and should) stop. The fact that triggering sources \ncan willingly end the sound poses as a challenge to acceptance. People \nmay be less likely to accept a situation of suffering if there is a perception that \nothers (who are often perceived to be the cause of the suffering) are able to \nchange their behavior and reduce the suffering. Further, and importantly, \nthis situation is compounded by the reality that the individual with \nmisophonia has asked loved ones to refrain from the triggers only to find \ntheir request forgotten, ignored, or denied (as exemplified in Emily’s \ncase). Thus, misophonia patients may believe that the sounds are out of \ntheir control, but, importantly, they still consider the sounds to be in the \nvolitional control of others (which is often technically true). This di-\nchotomy can hinder the willingness to accept the sound because they \nmay see “hope” in the disappearance of the triggering sounds by others \nwithholding the producing of such sounds. This hope can reduce the \nwillingness to experience the sounds and emotions, thus hindering the \nacceptance process. Hence, one of the aims of misophonia treatment is to \nhelp the patient accept the sounds as an unchangeable phenomenon in \ntheir life despite the reality that others can technically control the \ntriggers from occurring. Additionally, this hope that others may refrain \nfrom the triggers may make the individual feel that they themselves may \nhave some control over the trigger in situations where they do have \nsome interpersonal influence over the source of the sound which can \nmake this unhelpful form of hope even stronger. \n2.8. Salience of anger in misophonia \nA second difference between the application of ERP for OCD versus \nmisophonia is related to the salience of anger in the misophonic \nresponse. In order to treat misophonia it is imperative to work towards \nunderstanding this emotion so it can be properly addressed. Anger is \noften described as an emotion which emerges in reaction to a perceived \ninjustice or unfair treatment (Berkowitz, 1990). For example, when \npatients with misophonia perceive that making chewing sounds is \ninvasive and disgusting (Edelstein et al., 2013), it elicits the emotion of \nanger as these perceptions suggest that the situation is wrong, unfair, \nand unjust. The emotion is sustained so long that the individual per-\nceives the situation is wrong and should be changed. If in OCD the \ntherapeutic process is focused in engendering a framework where the \nsufferer can learn to accept and be open to unwanted future outcomes, \nthen here the work is different in that the focus is accepting an unwanted \nsituation that is already present. The temporal element greatly shifts the \nfocus in qualitative way, such what is being accepting is an unwanted \nreality that is very unlikely to change. When an individual “come to \nterms” with a reality and refrains from working to change it, anger \nsubsides. How one comes accepts this reality will be the focus of the \nproposed therapy. \nTaking into consideration anger and the interpersonal nature of the \ncondition, we will now turn to suggest a treatment approach that flows \nfrom our psychological model for misophonia. In the following section \nwe will offer a description and rationale of our treatment framework for \nmisophonia which we have termed experiential acceptance and stimulus \nengagement (EASE). 3.A misophonia treatment framework: experiential acceptance \nand stimulus engagement \nIn this section we aim to outline a general framework for psycho -\ntherapy tailored for the treatment of misophonia. The goal here is to \nprovide the parameters and basic core components for a treatment \nwhich we believe can be effective, and thus warrant future research. \nEASE is currently not meant to serve as a formal treatment protocol or \nmanual. \nThe core goal of EASE for misophonia is to address the maintaining \nfactors of the condition, which we have postulated to be rigidity and \navoidance. As per our model, rigidity contributes to a resistant dispo -\nsition toward the sounds, which leaves the individual with greater cued \nawareness of the sounds. This heightened awareness, in turn, generates \neven greater resistance to the sounds, thus contributing to a negative \ncycle. Cultivating flexibility and openness, which can thereby lead to \nacceptance, will be the ultimate aim of the treatment. In other words, \nthe aim of the therapy is to address the conditions that give rise to ri-\ngidity in order to develop flexibility by using the following three com-\nponents: (1) ending toxic hope, (2) eliminating avoidance and control \nstrategies, and (3) engagement in situations with triggering stimuli. In \naddition to these components, the intervention begins with psycho -\neducation about misophonia, an outline of the treatment model, and a \nreview of the rationale for the treatment. In the following sections we \nwill describe each component of EASE. \n3.1. Ending toxic hope \nAs discussed earlier, when someone perceives that they are the \nvictim of an injustice, the associated emotion is anger. People generally \ndo not readily permit and allow themselves to be the subject of an \ninjustice and it follows that they will struggle to end the unjust condi -\ntions. However, if a person does not believe that the situation can be \nchanged, despite that it is unjust, there will likely not be a struggle as the \nmere behaviors to change the situation are hopeless. Embedded within \nthe rigidly held view that others should not make aversive sounds is the \nhope that the sounds and thus the distress will somehow end. The aim of \nthis step is to end the hope that the sounds will end; one will likely not \nplace hope in a possibility that has zero chances of occurring. Inversely, \nit is very likely that this hope is what fuels efforts to eliminate the \ntriggers (e.g., punishing those who emit the sounds, avoiding meal-\ntimes). Moreover, akin to hoping for something that is outside the realm \nof likelihood (such as the spontaneous resurrection of a deceased pet), \nthe mere hope itself is unhelpful, if not dysfunctional. This form of hope \nwe label “toxic hope.” We believe that toxic hope leaves a person feeling \nthat they may have some power to end the triggers in their life, despite \nthe enduring reality suggesting otherwise. It is then crucial to directly \naddress this feeling by cultivating, willingly, a powerlessness in the face \nof the triggers. This disposition powerlessness is necessary for the \nqualitatively reducing other forms of control that in turn maintain \nmisophonia. When the individual knows there are no options and feels \npowerless, he or she can accept the unavoidable reality of the triggers: \nthere are no options left. When this happens, the reaction of anger \nshould be less instense. Unavoidable experiences are less likely to be \nconstrued as injustices than events over which people can exercise \ncontrol. . \nThe idea of simply letting go and not trying to do something about \nthe triggers can be viewed as somewhat perplexing and even \nFig. 2.Initial development of misophonia explained in terms of classical and operant conditioning.

In this regard, it useful to use a metaphor called “playing dead,” \nwhich describes how to survive being attacked by a grizzly bear. The \npractice involves simply lying on the floor and “playing dead.” While \nthis is a very counterintuitive response, it also is the most functional one. \nSimilarly, in misophonia, the goal is to resist the instinctual response to \n“do something” and instead “do nothing.” By choosing “non-doing” and \nexpecting the trigger to stay the same, the individual can then learn to \naccept the presence of the trigger. \nThis step can be enhanced through usage of an imaginal technique \nwe termed “the victorious surrender.” This latter point involves imaging \noneself with a trigger and coming up with all the ways the individual \nwill try to escape the situation. The therapist guides the individual to \n“give up” each one of those strategies until they are left with nothing. \nAlso addressed is the mere feeling of “hope” that they can do something \nabout the trigger sound. Specifically, patients are asked to imagine \nthemselves as completely powerless. This allows the individual to see \nwhat it looks like to be powerless in the face of the trigger, which is \nultimately the ideal therapeutic position to be in since having “surren -\ndered” one need no longer focus on the sound, thus termed “victorious \nsurrender.” In addition to learning about choosing to let go of forms of \nbehavior that give one the illusion of control, this exercise is also helpful \nfor identifying all the different forms of avoidance. \nAnother important element of this step is discussing the fact the view \nthat others can technically stop making the triggering sounds, which can \nerroneously lead one to feel that there is hope in that possibility – a hope \nthat can undermine willingness to let go of control strategies. This \ninterpersonal nuance is very important to address and, indeed, may be \none of the most challenging steps in the process of acceptance. To \naddress this, it is important to shift the discussion away from the moral \ncertitude regarding who is responsible for changing behavior (i.e., “who \nis right”) since this will likely lead to a futile discussion that will leave \nthe patient defensive about rigidly held personal views. Importantly, it is \nuseful to affirm the patient’s position that the sounds feel wrong. From \nthe perspective of the misophonia sufferer, it feels like the world is \nperpetrating an ongoing injustice against him or her. The choice thus \npresents itself: trying to do something about the triggers (as informed by \ntoxic hope and the control strategies) or stop doing something about and \ncome to terms with the reality that he or she lives in a world where \npeople could technically end the misery created by the sounds yet are \nunlikely to do so. Acceptance emerges as a natural consequence when the \nindividual stops struggling against their reality despite that fact that it feels \nunjust. This is a choice that is available to the misophonia sufferer. In \norder to make this step easier for the patient, it is important for the \ntherapist to be very validating of the difficult interpersonal feelings that \narise in a situation where people—loved ones–continue create painful \ntriggers despite many requests to stop. \n3.2. Reduction of avoidance \nOnce the individual with misophonia is willing to stop trying to \navoid the unwanted sounds, it is important to identify and address all the \nvarious forms of avoidance. We have identified three main categories of \navoidance behaviors: physical avoidance, cognitive avoidance, and \naltering others’ behavior. \nPhysical avoidance. This includes physically removing oneself from \nthe vicinity of sounds, such as leaving the dinner table and eating alone \n(Schroder et al., 2013), reducing the audiological perception of the \nsound by wearing sound-cancelling headphones, and utilizing \nwhite-noise to wash-out sounds (Schroder et al., 2013). Further, some \nhave reported mimicking the triggering sounds with the goal to “cancel” \nout the sound (Edelstein et al., 2013). \nCognitive avoidance. This involves any attempt to utilize one’s \ncognitive capacities to reduce the perception of the sound. For example, \nattempting to shift the attention to a different sound or trying to ignore \nthe sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013). Another form is trying to “reframe” the sounds as something other than it is to make it less aversive. For \nexample, imagining the crunching sound as someone grinding rocks \ninstead of eating. \nAvoidance by altering others’ behavior. This involves asking the \nindividuals making the sounds to alter their behavior in an effort to \nreduce the sound, such as refraining from making the sound or having \nthem leave the room (Edelstein et al., 2013). Others methods include \nnon-verbal communication such as “glaring” at them. \n3.3. Stimulus engagement \nOnce toxic hope and control strategies have been identified, the goal \nis to end utilization of avoidant strategies to allow for proactive \nengagement with the triggering stimuli, akin to exposures. This can be \nconducted in several way, both in and out of session. This will likely \nrequire creativity as each person with misophonia have their own \nunique triggers. In session the most accessible form of engagement with \nthe stimulus through the imaginal medium. Other options include \nbringing “triggering” individuals into session and/or listening and \nwatching to recordings of triggers. Additionally, a hierarchy may be \nused in planning these exercises as there are subjective differences be-\ntween the levels of distress that triggers can elicit for each individual \n(Frank & McKay, 2019). \nIt should be noted that one potential obstacle to the engagements is \nthe anxiety of letting go of control of their unhelpful coping strategies \ndue to a variety of worries or fears. For example, a patient may avoid \nengaging with the triggering sounds as they are afraid they will never \nenjoy life again (“if I allow others to make sounds I will always be \nmiserable.“) Another concern might be related to a fear of losing control \nand acting out on an aggressive impulse (“if I just let the sound occur, I \nmight hurt someone out of rage.“). Whatever the fear may be, we would \nrecommend an acceptance-based approach involving acceptance of the \nunwanted outcome as possible (akin to ERP) as opposed to a cognitive \nrestructuring approach (e.g., examining the evidence). The aim here is \nfor a “wraparound” acceptance of all unwanted experiences and possible \noutcomes. \n3.4. Vignette: treatment with EASE \nWe will now present a vignette of applying EASE utilizing the \naforementioned vignette of Emily. \nSession 1. The first session was conducted with Emily and her \nmother. In addition to collecting standard intake information, the focus \nof this session was to collect data regarding Emily’s current forms of \navoidance and coping. This information will be used towards elimi -\nnating avoidance. \nSession 2. The second session focused on psychoeducation about the \npsychological model of misophonia and EASE. A particular emphasis \nwas placed on the discussion of toxic hope, and used the “playing dead” \nmetaphor to discuss the topic of letting go of control strategies and \navoidance. Also practiced the “victorious surrender” exercise to help \nwith making the experience of letting go more relatable and \nunderstandable. \nHomework: Collaboratively identify areas to start reducing physical \navoidance and engaging in triggering situations for a longer period of \ntime than usual without engaging in any form of control, including \ncognitive and behavioral strategies to avoid experience. Emily chose to \njoin the family for dinner for 5 min every day. Also, she agreed to \npractice twice a day the “victorious surrender” exercise to get used the \nphilosophy of the therapy. \nSession 3. The third session began with reviewing the week. Emily \nshared that she followed through on most days, but noted some days \nwhen she was stressed, it was “too much.” Emily shared that most days \nwere “difficult” but “tolerable” and that at times she even stayed at the \ndinner table for longer than 5 min. Emily stated that she particularly \nstruggled with triggers that occurred outside of mealtime because they E.N. Cowan et al."

In collaboration with her therapist, Emily agreed to expand the \ntime at dinner to 10 min every night and also to watch television with \nher family for 10 min each evening – all while not engaging in any \navoidant strategies. \nSession 4–12. These sessions review homework and engage in \ntroubleshooting for any issues that might arise. Each session includes \nexercises practicing engagement with triggers without resorting in any \nform of avoidance or toxic hope. \nHomework: After each session, homework assignments continued to \nemphasize practice of stimulus engagement, with Emily gradually \nincreasing the amount of time spent in family situations without using \navoidant strategies. \n3.5. Limitations and future research \nThere are several limitations to the model and therapy formulations \npresented in this paper. Firstly, this paper is based on theory and has not \nyet been subject to empirical testing. Another limitation is that our \nmodel heavily relies on the research measuring personality traits and \ndisorders, which generally have proven difficult to measure with reli-\nability. We believe that future research should examine efficacy of our \nproposed treatment called EASE. Specifically, we believe the following \nhypothesis should be examined: (1) EASE will lead to a significant \nreduction of symptoms of awareness of triggering sounds, (2) EASE will \nlead to decreased level of distress when sounds are heard, and (3) EASE \nwill lead to increased levels of functioning. \n4.Conclusion \nMisophonia is a debilitating condition which has recently gained \nattention that, to our knowledge, lacks a comprehensive psychological \nmodel. To this end, this paper sought to develop one grounded in the \ncurrent published research. Based on the consistent findings that a \nmajority of individuals with misophonia report traits of rigidity, we \ndeveloped an etiological model explaining its symptoms. This model \nsuggested that traits of rigidity combined with classical conditioning, \noperant conditioning, and generalization, play a role in the development \nand maintenance of misophonic symptoms. Flowing from the model, we \nconcluded with a proposed treatment, EASE, an acceptance-based pro-\ntocol that consists of ending toxic hope, reducing avoidance, and stim-\nulus engagement. \nDeclarations of interests \nNone. \nAuthor statement \nWe declare that this manuscript is original, has not been published \nbefore and is not currently being considered for publication elsewhere. \nDeclaration of competing interest \n☒ The authors declare that they have no known competing financial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \nthe work reported in this paper.
