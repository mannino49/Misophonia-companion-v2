Some experts consider misophonia an emotional \nresponse disorder while others consider misophonia a n emotional and physical reflex disorder. \nThe Safe  and Sound Protocol  (SSP)  is a five -hour music listening program based on polyvagal \ntheory designed in improve autonomic regulation , reduce auditory hypersensitivity , and increase \nsocial engagement . A brief misophonia therapy with emphasis on relaxation an d the five -hour \nSSP listening program was provided to nine participants . The median reduction in misophonia \nseverity was 15% on the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire and 25% on the Misophonia \nResponse Scale . Further investigation of SSP as a component of  treatment for misophonia is \nwarranted."

      "text": "Safe and Sound Protocol with Brief Therapy for Misophonia: A Pilot Study  \nMisophonia was first identified as a condition in 1997 and is not currently included in t he DSM -\n5 or the ICD -11 (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023) . Misophonia is an under -studied  condition in which a \nperson has an extreme reaction to subtle stimuli  (for example,  mouth or nasal sounds  or hair \ntwirling ), and there are no empirically validated treatments for misophonia . Misophonia is \ngenerally viewed as a poorly understood  emotional response disorder  (Swedo et al., 2022) and by \nothers as a physical and emotional reflex disorder (Dozier, Lopez, & Pearson, 2017) . A recent \ntheory of misophonia provides the model of misophonia as a physical and emotional reflex \ndisorder and is shown in Figure 1 (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023) .  \nFigure 1. Mitchell -Dozier model of misophonia. (1) Anticipatory anxiety and avoidance, (2) the \nmisophonic trigger stimulus elicits the i nitial physical reflex (e.g., muscle flinch), (3) intense emotional \nresponse of misophonia, physiological distress, thoughts, urges and emotion driven behaviors while the \ntrigger continues, (4) coping responses after the trigger, including covert mental re view and overt \nbehavior, and (5) environmental response and internal and external consequences. The dotted connection \nindicates phase 3 contributes to strengthening of the initial physical reflex, phases 2 to 5 contribute to \nstrengthening anticipatory anxi ety and avoidance of phase 1 and phase 5 contributes to strengthening \nphases 3 and 4. (Source: Dozier & Mitchell, 2023)  \n \nThis model of misophonia is used by therapists associated or trained by Misophonia Institute to \nprovide treatment for misophonia . These treatments include Sequent Repatterning Hypnotherapy \ndeveloped by Chris Pearson, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy – Misophonia developed by Nate \nMitchell, and Relaxation and Counterconditioning Therapy developed by Tom Dozier.  \nThe Safe & Sou nd Protocol (SSP ; Unyte Health, 2023 ) is a  practical application of polyvagal \ntheory, designed to help people learn to attain a grounded physiological and emotional state \nwhere they feel safe, connected, calm, and social . It has been shown to improve  audit ory \nhypersensitivity,  behavioral state regulation, and social engagement behaviors through five hours \nof listening to  SSP specially -filtered music  with a safe listening partner . There are thousands of \ntrained SSP providers and tens -of-thousands of people w ho have completed SSP . Numerous \nclinical trials of SSP have demonstrated significant improvements in autonomic state regulation, \nsensory processing, mental health, and social engagement. The results of data collected on SSP \ndelivery system have found impro vements in autonomic state regulation, sensory processing, \nsocial engagement, and functional skills. SSP is not a stand -alone treatment package . It is to be"

For more information on SSP see \nhttps://integratedlistening.com/products/ssp -safe-sound -protocol/  \nWe hypothesized  that a combination of SSP and brief, basic misophonia treatment will provide a \nreduction in misophonia severity  for study participants . \nMethod  \nParticipants  \nThe opportunity to participate in this pilot study was posted on Facebook misophonia groups and \nin the Misophonia Institute email newsletter . Interested individuals were emailed an Informed \nCons ent document .  \nNine  individuals signed up and completed the study . Demographics are as follows: 7 female, 2 \nmale, age range 15 to 60 years (mean 40.2, sd 15.4), race white.  \nProcedure  \nParticipants were informed that they could choose an SSP provider of their choice or work wit h \nTom Dozier, the principle investigator of this study . All participants chose to work with Tom \nDozier . After returning the informed consent, each person was added as a client on the SSP \nprovider portal . The misophonia severity measures were emailed  to the  individual as fillable PDF \ndocuments and returned via email . The SSP i ntake assessment was sent via the SSP provider \nportal and completed online.  \nOnce the SSP assessment and misophonia severity measures were completed, an initial session \nwas scheduled . The meeting was conducted on HIPAA compliant Zoom. The initial session \nincluded a discussion on autonomic regulation, how the SSP has been shown to improved \nautonomic regulation, and an overview of misophonia theory . Individuals were also tested  for an \ninitial physical reflex (IPR; see Figure 1, phase 2)  to determine if they could perceive the IPR \nand determine the affected  muscle or part of the body , using the procedure from Dozier & \nMorrison (2017) . Participants were encouraged to breathe and r elax muscles when they might be \nexposed to a trigger, and to breathe and relax muscles if there was an ongoing trigger.  \nSSP sessions require a safe listening partner for co -regulation . Five participants listened with a \nfamily member, one with a friend, two with their dog, and one with  Tom Dozier via Zoom . \nRemote (not in the therapist’s office) SSP listening sessions are provided via the Un yte ILS app. \nTitration, or the rate of providing SSP listening, is important to ensure  the listener does not \nexperience dysregulation . Unyte recommendation for listening is 30 -minute sessions . Unyte has \nan SSP slogan of, “You can go too fast, but you can’t go too slow. ” An initial 5 -minute session \nwas conducted in the first session with Tom Dozier. All participants remained calm during this \nshort listening session . Participants were instructed to conduct a 5 -minute listening session with \ntheir listening partner that day , and then complete a 10 -minute listening session every day, \nprovided they did not experience dysregulation during the session . If they experienced \ndysregulation during the session, they were to stop that session, and continue SSP with shorter \nsessions. (N one of the participants experience any dysregulation).  Once the first hour of SSP was \ncomplete, the session time was increased to 20 minutes per day for the remaining four hours of \nSSP.  Participants were allowed to use shorter listening sessions and to ski p days.  \nParticipants were asked to have a follow -up session the next week, additional sessions if they \ndesired, and a final session after they completed SSP.

      "text": "relaxing when exposed to triggers was emphasized in all sessio ns. After completing SSP, the \nmisophonia severity measures were emailed to the participant and returned by email.  \nMeasures  \nMisophonia  severity questionnaires included the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ)  \nand the Misophonia Response Scale (MRS) . The MAQ consists of 21 questions about the \nnegative impact of misophonia on the person’s activities, thoughts, and feelings  (Dozer 2015a ). \nEach question has a 0 to 3 rating, with 0 being “not at all” and 3 being “almost all of the time ,” \nand a maxim um possible sum score of 63. The Misophonia Response Scale  (MRS) rates \nemotional and physical response severity and how misophonia interferes  in 5 domains of life on \na 1-7 scale.  The MRS also includes factors of frequency of triggers, time to recover from a \ntrigger , and avoidance. The maximum MRS score is 49, and historical average severity of those \nseeking treatment is 20.  Both the MAQ and MRS are validated measures of misophonia  severity.  \n(Altin et al., 2022; Dibb et al., 2021 )  \nResults  \nMisophonia severity response to  treatment is shown in Figures 2  and 3 and in Table 1 .

      "text": "Eight participants reported a moderate or better positive res ponse to treatment, but most still \nexperienced misophonia triggers  upon completion of this study . Only  one participant , with the \nlowest  misophonia severity , reported no longer experiencing triggers.  One participant reported a \nslight worsening of misophonia . This person was the only participant  unable to identify an IPR \nresponse and the only one that received SSP with a listening partner via Zoom. There were no \nnegative responses toward the SSP listening experience, and all reported experiencing the calm, \npeaceful feel ings. Several reported feeling more connected to their listening partner or a desire \nfor more social engagement.  The median response to treatment was a reduction of 15% on the \nMAQ and 25% on the MRS misophonia severity scales.  \nLimitations  \nThere are several limitations with this study. First , as a pilot study, this study was not conducted \nunder the oversight of an Institutional Review Board. Second , measures of misophonia severity \nare based on self -report,  which is known to h ave reliability issues.  Third , the number of \nparticipants was small. Finally,  the study included both SSP and a brief treatment for \nmisophonia, so the contribution  of each is unknown . \nConclusion  \nSSP was very well received by all participants, and a modes t level of reduction in misophonia \nseverity was reported by most participants . SSP is a low -cost, low -risk and pleasant intervention \nand may be reasonably considered as a component of misophonia treatment . Based on these \nresults, m ore research on SSP as a treatment for misophonia treatment is warranted.  \n \nReferences  \n1. Altın B, Aksoy S.
