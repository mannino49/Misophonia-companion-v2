Our study aims to investigate the auditory brainstem functioning using \nelectrophysiological measures in normal -hearing individuals with and without misophonia.  \nMethods:  Thirty participants aged between 18 and 30 years were recruited. They were divided into two primary \ngroups: fifteen individuals diagnosed with misophonia and fifteen controls. The selection of participants with \nmisophonia w as based on the diagnostic criteria by Schröder et al. and the MisoQuest  questionnaire , Auditory \nbrainstem response (ABR) was recorded from all the individuals at lower (11.1/s) and higher stimulus rates \n(90.1/s).  \nResults: On analy sing the data, individuals with misophonia showed significantly shorter absolute latencies of \nABR waves III and V at 11.1/s. Also, there was no significant difference in the absolute amplitude of ABR waves \nat 11.1/s and 90.1/s  between the individuals with and without mis ophonia.  \nConclusion:  This study indicates that the shorter absolute latencies of ABR waves III and V in individuals in \nmisophonia could be attributed to hyperactivity at the sub -cortical pathway regions compared to the control group.  \nKeywords: Misophonia; Audiology, Auditory brainstem response; hyperactivity  \n \nIntroduction  \nThe term \"misophonia\" originates from the Greek words \"misos,\" meaning hatred, and \"phónè,\" meaning sound.  \nOver time, the term misophonia has become the predominant term to describe this c ondition, as evidenced by \nrecent studies [1,2].  This term encapsulates the core characteristic of the phenomenon, referring to the intense \nadverse emotional and physiological reactions associated with decreased sound tolerance (DST) [ 3,4]. \nMisophonia is a  relatively recent concept in audiology and psychology, having gained recognition only in the \npast few decades. The hallmark of misophonia is the presence of extreme adverse responses to specific auditory"

      "text": "stimuli, referred to as \"triggers.\" These triggers can provoke many emotional and physiological reactions [ 5]. \nThese triggers may involve specific auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli [ 1,5]. Human -produced sounds, such \nas breathing, chewing, lip -smacking, and swallowing, can serve as unpleasant auditory triggers . Repetitive \nmovements such as leg shaking or the appearance of lips moving while chewing can be visual triggers  [1,5]. \nAdditionally, sounds unrelated to the human body, like clicking, rustling, and typing, can also function as auditory \ntriggers [ 1,5]. Misophonia is a condition that draws from audiology, neurology, and psychiatry, yet lacks clearly  \ndefined diagnostic criteria and standardized assessment protocols across these fields.  [4,5]. Although the \ncondition has garnered increasing attention in recent years, the scientific community has yet to reach a consensus \non the most effective methods for diagnosis and treatment [6]. Studies examining the prevalence of misophonia \nhave been conducted in diverse populations across various countri es, including students and the general public. \nIn Western nations, reported prevalence rates range from 4.6% to 54% [7,8], while in India, the prevalence is \nestimated to range from 15% to 34% [9  -13].  \nWhile the focus of audiological assessment in individu als with misophonia has traditionally been subjective tests, \na few studies have explored objective testing using auditory evoked potentials [14 -20]. A study by Kim et al . \nreported an enhanced wave I ABR amplitude in individuals with misophonia and a prolonged wave V latency \ncompared to individuals with hyperacusis and control subjects [2 0]. In contrast, Aryal and Prabhu found no \nstatistically significant differences betwee n individuals with misophonia and other groups in ABR amplitudes, \nabsolute latencies, or interpeak latencies . The result of the ir study suggests that individuals with misophonia may \nexhibit normal neuronal synchrony up to the brainstem regions [2 1]. Howeve r, Aryal and Prabhu included only \nindividuals with mild to moderate misophonia, leaving the potential for variations in brainstem processing \nunexamined in individuals with more severe forms of the disorder [2 1].  \nSimilarly, Kim et al did not report the sev erity of misophonia in their sample [2 0]. Consequently, it is possible \nthat variations in brainstem processing could be associated with the severity of misophonia, with individuals \nexhibiting more severe symptoms potentially demonstrating abnormal processi ng at the brainstem level. \nTherefore, it can be hypothesized  that neural processing up to the brainstem level could be altered among \nindividuals with misophonia.  This altered neural activity may contribute to the heightened sensitivity to sound \nstimuli obs erved in more severe cases of misophonia, potentially resulting from impaired processing of auditory \nsignals at the brainstem [2 2,23]. Considering the disparities in findings from previous studies, further research \nexploring the auditory brainstem function ing in individuals with misophonia having higher severity is warranted.  \nElectrophysiological measures, such as ABR testing, could provide more definitive insights into the neural \nmechanisms underlying this condition. Hence, the  study aims to assess audito ry brainstem functioning using \nelectrophysiological measures in individuals with and without misophonia. Specifically, the objective is to \ncompare the ABR parameters, including latencies and amplitudes, elicited by clicks at stimulus rates of 11.1/s \nand 90 .1/s between individuals with misophonia and a control group without the condition.  \n \nMethods  \n \nStudy Participants  \nA standard group comparison with purposive sampling was applied in this study. A total of thirty participants \naged between 18 and 30 years were  recruited . The participants were divided into two primary groups: fifteen \nindividuals  diagnosed with misophonia  (12 females , 3 males)  (mean age: 23 .25 years, SD: 2. 89 years)  and fifteen \ncontrols  (9 females , 6 males ) (mean age: 23 years, SD: 2. 80 years) . In the misophonia group, ten individuals had \na moderate degree of misophonia, and five had severe misophonia. The selection of participants with misophonia \nwas based on the diagnostic criteria by Schröder et al. [24] and the MisoQuest  questionnaire , as des cribed by \nSiepsiak et al. [ 25]. The severity of misophonia was assessed using the Revised Amsterdam Misophonia Scale \n(RAMISO -S) [26]. RAMISO -S scores were classified as follows: 0–10 indicating no misophonia (subclinical), \n11–20 indicating mild misophonia,  21–30 indicating moderate misophonia, and 31–40 indicating severe \nmisophonia. Individuals with scores ≤ 10 were considered to have no misophonia, while those scoring 21 or higher \nwere included in the study.  \nInclusion criteria were as follows: participants with no significant history of otological disorders, prolonged or \nfrequent exposure to loud noise, alcohol consumption, smoking, ototoxic drug use, a family history of hearing \nloss, or any other medical conditions that might influence the study outcomes.

The participants were first evaluated \nthrough otoscopy to check for outer ear and ear canal anomalies. This was followed by standard pure tone \naudiometry  (PTA) , immittance evaluation  (IE), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to ensure \nnormal hearing sensitivity, middle ear function, and outer hair cells functio ning, respectively. All the testing \nprocedures were carried out in a randomized order for both ears.  \nPure tone audiometry   \nAir conduction thresholds were measured using a calibrated two -channel clinical audiometer, the Inventis Piano \n(Inventis Padova, Italy), with Telephonics Dynamic Headphones 39 earphones fitted with MX -41/AR supra -aural \near cushions. Bone conduction thresholds were obtained using the Radio Ear B -71 bone vibrator. The criterion \nfor normal hearing sensitivity was defined as ≤ 15 dB HL a t octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000  Hz for air \nconduction and 250 Hz to 4000 Hz for bone conduction, based on the modified Hughson -Westlake procedure \n[29].  \nImmittance evaluation   \nAn immittance evaluation was performed using a Grason -Stadler Tympstar Pro immittance meter to assess \nmiddle ear function (Grason Stadler, Inc., MN, USA). Tympanometry was administered with a probe tone of 226 \nHz at 85 dB SPL, and acoustic reflexes were me asured at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz frequencies. All \nparticipants exhibited 'A' type tympanograms with present acoustic reflexes at 500 and 1000 Hz, as reported in \nprevious studies [30].  \nDistortion product otoacoustic emissions  \nDPOAEs were measured usi ng the Otodynamics DP Echoport otoacoustic emission instrument (ILO292 -USB -\nII, V6), with measurements at octave and mid -octave frequencies between 1 kHz and 6 kHz. A signal -to-noise \nratio (SNR) of +6 dB at three consecutive frequencies indicated the presen ce of otoacoustic emissions [31]. All \nparticipants met the inclusion criteria and underwent Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) testing.  \nTesting environment  \nAll procedures were conducted in an acoustically treated room, adhering to the noise level standards  specified by \nthe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Acoustical Society of America  (ASA) ANSI/ASA S3.1 -1999 \n[32].  \n \nAuditory brainstem response  \nABR was recorded using the calibrated four -channel SmartEP Intelligent Hearing Systems (IHS, Miami, FL). \nElectrodes were placed according to the 10–20 International System: one positive electrode at Fz (high forehead), \ntwo negative electrodes at the right (M2) and left (M1) mastoid regions, and a ground electrode at FPz (lower \nforehead) [33]. Impedance l evels were maintained below 5 kΩ for absolute impedance and 2 kΩ for inter -\nelectrode impedance [34,35].  In this study, stimuli were presented at a single intensity level of 80 dB nHL, as this \nhigher intensity, coupled with a higher  stimulation rate  (90.1/s ), helps detect retrocochlear lesions, including \nabnormalities in the auditory nerve and brainstem structures [ 34].  Before the ABR testing, the participants were \nprovided the test stimuli (clicks) at 80 dB nHL and ensured that the intensity was tolerable and did not cause any \ndiscomfort for all the participants . Two repetitions of 1500 sweeps were recorded for each rate for reliable \nrecordings  [34,35].  A binaural ABR was recorded  for each participant . Stimulus and acquisition parameters are \nprovided in Table 1.  \n \nStatistical Analyses  \nThe statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The \ndata distribution was assessed using the Shapiro –Wilk test of normality, which revealed a non -normal distribution \n(p < 0.05). Consequently, non -parametric tests were employed to further analyze the data.    \n \nResults  \nAuditory brainstem response findings"

These parameters were recorded and \ntabulated for subsequent statistic al analysis. ABR waves I and III were absent at a stimulus rate of 90.1/s in most \nparticipants; therefore , these parameters were excluded from the analysis .  \nComparison of Absolute latency in individuals with and without misophonia  \nThe results of the absolute latencies were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis.

Results show ed that \ninterpeak latencies of wave I – V were  earlier  at 11.1/s in individuals with misophonia compared to control \ngroups. The interpeak latencies of wave I -III and III -V at 11.1/s were similar between the two groups.  \nThe median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum of interpeak latencies (ms) of all the ABR waves at 11.1/s are \nrepresented in Figure 4.  \nThe mean , standard deviation , and r esults of the Mann –Whitney U test for interpeak latencies (ms) of all the \nwaves of ABR are provided in Table 4.  \nFurthermore, Mann -Whitney U tests were conducted to see the differences between the two groups.

The \nresults indicate that individuals with misophonia exhibited earlier absolute latencies for waves III and V at a \nstimul us rate of 11.1/s . In general, latency denotes the timing of responses from neural sources [34,35].  Wave \nIII and IV originate at the cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex. Wave V is majorly generated in the \nlateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus [34, 35]. Hence, the results of our study suggest a possible hyperactivity \nat these sub -cortical centers in individuals with misophonia. The absolute latencies of wave III and V at 80 dB \nnHL and 11.1/s stimulus rate  could be a good indicator of the unique trend of ABR in those with misophonia. \nAlso, these results support our hypothesis that misophonia is associated with altered sub -cortical auditory \nprocessing. However, the similar latencies for wave I at 11.1/s sugg est that the peripheral auditory system, which \nincludes the cochlea and the auditory nerve, may not be significantly different between the two groups."

      "text": "Specifically, the  earlier  latencies of these waves indicate the heightened response to the auditory stim uli in \nindividuals with misophonia.  It is speculated  that the neural hyperactivity at the sub -cortical auditory regions \nsuch as the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, and inferior colliculus  contributes to \nthe heightened respons e. These findings align with the previous study  by Aryal and Prabhu which  reported that \nthe latency of P1 and N1 peaks of cortical auditory evoked potentials are significantly shortened in individuals \nwith misophonia . They stated that there could be a possible existence of altered auditory processing within \nspecific brain regions that generate these peaks among individuals with misophonia [22]. Similarly, our study has \nalso shown shortened latencies of ABR, which sugge sts heightened neural activity at the subcortical level, too, \nin individuals with misophonia.  \nInterestingly, in the present study, no significant difference was observed in the absolute amplitude at lower and \nhigher stimulus rates between the two groups, which underscores that while the timing of the neural response \n(latency) to sound is altered, the number of neurons firing  (amplitude)  response remains unaltered in individuals \nwith misophonia. Similarly, a study by Aryal and Prabhu , also reported no signi ficant difference in the amplitude \nof ABR  that may be attributed to the inclusion of individuals with milder severity [21].   In contrast, Kim et al \nfound that individuals with misophonia showed enhanced wave I amplitude compared to the control group [20]. \nFurthermore, the earlier interpeak latency of  wave I -V in individuals with misophonia further supports the idea \nof a rapid neural response in this group, suggesting heightened activity of auditory signals through the brainstem. \nThis is consistent with our  study hypothesis that individuals with misophonia might process auditory stimuli more \nrapidly, contributing to the hypersensitivity characteristic of the condition. Thus, the results of our study provide \nobjective evidence for hyperactivity at the sub -cortical level, resulting in faster conduction times as evidenced in \nABR.  \nConsequently, this study provides valuable insights into the subtle differences in the auditory brainstem response \nfindings among individuals with misophonia. Thus, the earlier arrival  of auditory brainstem response waves could \nbe a potential indicator in identifying misophonia, providing an electrophysiological index to adjunct clinical \nassessments and enhancing our understanding of this condition. The study findings could help clinici ans and \nresearchers pave the way for tailored therapeutic interventions for individuals with misophonia . \n \nConclusions  \nThe current study attempted to assess the auditory brainstem functioning of individuals with misophonia. The \npresent study utilized electrophysiological measures and revealed that individuals with misophonia may exhibit \nheightened activity in the areas inv olved in generating Auditory Brainstem Response  (ABR ) waves III and V.  \nAlthough ABR is sensitive to brainstem alterations, it is essential to note that auditory cortical and behavioral \nmeasures would supplement the ABR findings and provide a comprehensive  understanding of the \nneurophysiological basis of misophonia.  In our study, we recorded binaural ABR, suggesting that future research \ncould explore and compare both monoaural and binaural ABR in individuals with misophonia. Additionally, the \nresults need t o be replicated in larger samples before considering ABR as a potential biomarker in individuals \nwith higher severity of misophonia . \n \nEthical approval and consent to participate:  \nCompliance with ethical guidelines  \nIn the current study, all of the testing procedures were accomplished using a non -invasive technique and adhered \nto the conditions of the institutional ethical approval committee.
