      "text": "AUDIOLOGY FEATURE\nAutism spectrum disorder \n(hereafter ‘autism’) is a \nheterogeneous, lifelong \nneurodevelopmental condition \ncharacterised by difficulties with social \ncommunication, repetitive behaviours, \nand atypical reactions to sensory aspects \nof the environment. Notably, an estimated \n50-70% of autistic individuals demonstrate \nclinically significant decreased sound \ntolerance (DST , i.e. an inability to tolerate \neveryday sounds) at some point in their lives \n[1], often resulting in referrals of autistic \nchildren and adults to audiologists or \nother hearing health professionals. As DST \nin autism appears to represent multiple \ndistinct yet often overlapping syndromes \n[2] (i.e. hyperacusis, misophonia, and \nphonophobia), it is extremely important \nthat clinicians be aware of the differences \nbetween these conditions and feel \ncomfortable distinguishing between them \nwhen making a diagnosis.   \nHyperacusis (Figure 1) is a hearing \ndisorder in which sound of moderate \nintensity is perceived as excessively \nloud, painful, and/or overwhelming [2]. \nIndividuals with hyperacusis perceive \neveryday sounds, such as the sounds of domestic appliances or electric hand driers, \nas uncomfortably loud or , in some cases, \nphysically painful. Though frequently \nassociated with tinnitus and peripheral \nhearing loss in the general population, \nhyperacusis in autism is thought to be \nneurodevelopmental in nature [2], and \nadditional signs of peripheral auditory \ndamage are frequently absent in this \npopulation. As in cases of hyperacusis not \nassociated with autism, audiometric testing \nof uncomfortable loudness levels can \nsupport the diagnosis, although this test is \ntypically only appropriate in adolescents \nand adults without significant cognitive or \nlanguage impairment. While there is no \nconsensus among professionals regarding \nthe specific criteria used to make a clinical \ndiagnosis of hyperacusis, operational \ncriteria used by my research group to define \nhyperacusis are presented in Figure 1 to \nassist clinicians in making this diagnosis. \nMisophonia (Figure 2) is a newly-\ndescribed condition in which individuals have excessive and inappropriate emotional \nresponses to specific ‘trigger’ sounds \n(e.g. chewing, tapping, and sniffling), \neven when those sounds are not loud \n[2]. Anger , extreme irritation, disgust, and \nanxiety are the most common emotions, \nthough some individuals may experience \nrage [3]. Misophonic triggers may evoke \na ‘fight or flight’ response, including \nnonspecific physical symptoms such as \nmuscle tension, increased heartrate, \nand sweating. Unlike in hyperacusis, \nin which the acoustic properties of a \nsound (i.e. intensity, frequency, and \nduration) strongly predict that sound’s \naversiveness, misophonic reactions are \nheavily context-dependent and may be \ndiminished or absent if individuals with \nmisophonia make the triggering sound(s) \nthemselves [4]. Furthermore, despite large \nindividual differences in specific trigger \nnoises, reactions to those trigger noises, \nand degree of context-dependence, the \nmajority of individuals with misophonia Decreased sound tolerance in autism: \nunderstanding and distinguishing between \nhyperacusis, misophonia, and phonophobia  \nBY ZACHARY J WILLIAMS\nDecreased sound tolerance (DST) affects a significant proportion of autistic people \nthroughout their lifetime and, as Zachary J Williams  explains, it is important that \nclinicians are aware of the three distinct subtypes of DST when making a diagnosis.   \n“Though frequently \nassociated with tinnitus \nand peripheral hearing \nloss in the general \npopulation, hyperacusis \nin autism is thought to be \nneurodevelopmental in \nnature” \nENT & Audiology News | MAY/JUNE 2022  | VOL 31 NO 2  | www.entandaudiologynews.com"

A \nrecent expert consensus paper proposed \na definition of misophonia for use in \nclinical and research settings, although \nconcrete diagnostic criteria were not \nspecified [3]. To further support clinicians \nin making a diagnosis of misophonia, \noperational research criteria (adapted \nfrom the consensus definition [3] and the \nearlier ‘Revised Amsterdam Criteria’ for \nmisophonia [4]) are provided in Figure 2.  \nAlthough the word ‘phonophobia’ has \nbeen used to refer to multiple symptoms \nand conditions within the medical literature \n(e.g. hyperacusis, episodic DST associated \nwith headaches, and loudness disturbance \ndue to facial nerve damage) the term \nhere is used to refer to a marked fear or \nanxiety about specific sounds or situations \nin which a person might encounter \nunpleasant sounds [2]. In other words, \nphonophobia refers to a specific phobia \nof sound, as defined within the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, \nFifth Edition  (DSM-5) [5] and its upcoming \ntext revision (Figure 3). Phonophobia can \nbe circumscribed to very specific sounds \nor generalised to all sounds with specific \nqualities (e.g. loud sounds, high-pitched \nsounds, sudden/unexpected sounds, or \nsounds associated with a feared object/\nsituation). However , in all cases, the \ndiagnosis is only appropriate if the phobic \nsound/situation almost always provokes \nfear and/or anxiety and this fear/anxiety is \nout of proportion to the danger posed by the \nspecific object/situation.  \n“Although hyperacusis, \nmisophonia, and \nphonophobia are all \npresent in the autistic \npopulation, there is a \nnotable lack of evidence-\nbased options for diagnosis \nand treatment of these \nprevalent and impairing \nconditions”\nFigure 1. Operational Diagnostic Criteria for Hyperacusis.  These criteria are used in an ongoing research study at Vanderbilt \nUniversity Medical Center to standardise the clinical diagnosis of hyperacusis. Criteria A–E must all be met for a diagnosis to be \ngiven. This diagnosis of hyperacusis subsumes both “loudness hyperacusis” (criterion A1) and “pain hyperacusis” (criterion A2), \nparticularly given the unclear distinction between the two subtypes in terms of underlying pathophysiology. For billing purposes, \nICD-10-CM code H93.233 (“Hyperacusis, bilateral”) can be used.\nFigure 2. Operational Diagnostic Criteria for Misophonia.  Criteria are modified from the 2020 Revised Amsterdam Criteria [4], \nincorporating information from the 2021 consensus definition of misophonia [3]. Criteria A–F must all be met for a diagnosis to be \ngiven. These criteria differ from the Revised Amsterdam Criteria insofar as (a) oro-nasal sounds are not required for diagnosis and \n(b) misophonia can be diagnosed regardless of other psychiatric or neurodevelopmental conditions, provided that all diagnostic \ncriteria are met. Although misophonia is not formally recognised within systems of medical billing, we suggest that the diagnosis \nbe captured under the ICD-10-CM code H93.299 (“Other abnormal auditory perceptions, unspecified ear”).\nENT & Audiology News | MAY/JUNE 2022  | VOL 31 NO 2  | www.entandaudiologynews.com"

AUDIOLOGY FEATURE\nNotably, phonophobia can develop \nsecondary to other DST conditions such \nas hyperacusis or misophonia. However , \nin cases where feared sounds result in \nsignificant pain, auditory discomfort, or \nother physical symptoms, an additional \ndiagnosis of phonophobia should be \nreserved for individuals who experience \nfear and anxiety to a much greater degree \nthan would be expected for an individual \nwith their same level of hyperacusis/\nmisophonia symptoms. In particularly \nsevere cases of hyperacusis, in which \ncertain sounds may cause extreme pain that \npersists for multiple days after exposure, \nfear and avoidance of the aversive sounds \nis arguably not excessive or irrational, and \nphonophobia should only be diagnosed if an \nindividual demonstrates the same marked \nfear of sounds that are not known to greatly \nexacerbate their hyperacusis symptoms.   \nAlthough hyperacusis, misophonia, and \nphonophobia are all present in the autistic \npopulation, there is a notable lack of \nevidence-based options for diagnosis and \ntreatment of these prevalent and impairing \nconditions, particularly in young children \nand individuals with significant cognitive \nor language impairments. Nevertheless, even with limited access to a patient’s \ninternal experiences, knowledgeable \nclinicians may be able to make a clear \ndistinction between different subtypes \nof DST based on consideration of the \nsounds the patient finds aversive, the \ndegree to which context modulates their \nreactions, and the presence of observable \nfear or anxiety in certain situations (see \nFigures 1-3). With regards to management, \nstrategies should be individualised to \nthe patient’s and family’s needs and can \ninclude modalities such as behavioural or \ncognitive-behavioural therapy (often with \nan exposure/habituation component), \noccupational therapy, sound generators, \namplification, medications, use of ear \nprotection in certain situations, and \nenvironmental modifications. Though \nthere is insufficient evidence to strongly \nsupport any of these interventions for DST \nin autism, the treatment of this common \nsymptom remains an area of great clinical \nneed. Thus, additional basic and clinical \nresearch is desperately needed on DST in \nautism and other populations to improve \nthe lives of the millions of individuals who \nexperience these often-disabling sound \nsensitivity syndromes.. \nReferences \n1.
