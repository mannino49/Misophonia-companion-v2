      "text": "Emilie Schramer and Alicia Pensamiento\nSpeech and Hearing Science, Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, University of Illinois at Urbana -ChampaignSound Rage: A Review of the Implications of Misophonia for College Age Students\nAIM\nToinvestigate existing literature, synthesizing research\nonmisophonia inthepopulation ofcollege agestudents\ninorder tounderstand any patterns .Particularly, our\ninterest liesinthepotential negative effects misophonia\nhasoncollege students’ learning.INTRODUCTION\nWhat is misophonia ?\n•A relatively recently identified disorder in humans, only \nrecognized as a medical disorder since 2001\n•Individuals have low tolerance and extreme sensitivity to certain sound stimuli ( mouth sounds, eating, nasal \nsounds, rustling or crinkling, repetitive tapping, etc ).\n•Many act on this sensitivity by outbursts, rage, avoidance, or other uncontrollably negative emotions\n•Familiarity component: misophonic reactions typically worsen when the sounds are produced by parents or siblings\nHow is it classified or diagnosed?•Misophonia has disordered aspects in audiology, with \nthe sound sensitivity, as well as psychological \ncomponents: anxiety, rage, and common co -occurrent \ndisorders such as OCD or eating disorders\n•Currently many assessments created to diagnose/study misophonia among researchers (not \nstandardized)\n•Variation in definition and diagnostic criteria  no \nofficial diagnostic formulation within the DSM -V or \nICD-10LITERATURE SEARCH\nWe conducted a review of already -published articles on \nmisophonia . This was done in this sequence.\nInitial UIUC Library Database Search\n•Search term “ misophonia ”\n•2006 –2022\n•Academic Journal Articles (534)\n•Main Databases: 122 Complementary Index, 112 \nMEDLINE, 105 Academic Search Ultimate\n•Expository information gained\nTargeted UIUC Library Database Search\n•Search term “ misophonia ” + “college”\n•2006 –2022\n•Academic Journal Articles (181)\n•Main Databases: 74 Scopus, 69 Academic Search \nUltimate, 20 MEDLINE\n•Specific, college -age population information gained\nInclusion and Exclusion of Articles\n•Inclusion was then based on a main focus of \nmisophonia as the subject of research, and any level \nof description of college age population relating to misophonia\n•Type of study was irrelevant: we used case studies, experiment/intervention designs, other scoping reviews, etc.\n•Exclusion of studies occurred for articles which returned key terms yet did not discuss the college age population specificallyRESULTS\nFindings on Prevalence•No widely endorsed guidelines –different definitions of \nmisophonia result in different prevalence reports\n•Three main studies focus on prevalence of misophonia\namong college -aged students\nOf these 3 studies:•Wu et. al (2014) study found 20% with clinically \nsignificant misophonia\n•Zhou et. al (2017) found 20% with clinically significant misophonia\n•Naylor et. al (2020) found 49.1% with clinically \nsignificant misophonia\n•Compared to general population with about 15% \nprevalence of misophonia\n1, on average misophonia\nmay affect between 20 -25% of the college student \nsamples\n•Generalizability is not strong DISCUSSION\nProblems•Few studies available which focus on misophonia and \ncollege -age students\n•Even fewer give data on incidence/prevalence\n•Very different diagnostic criteria or assessments \ndifferent prevalence findings\n•External validity unreliable  no conclusion can be \ndrawn on increased prevalence of misophonia for \ncollege students vs. general population\nImplications on Academic Success•While there is currently limited information, \nprevalence rates of misophonia in college-age \npopulation may either mirror or be at higher levels than the general population\n•Very few professors reported knowledge of \nmisophonia , reflecting a lack of awareness about \npossible accommodations\n•Students with misophonia not likely to get \naccommodations academics will suffer\n•However, there is a willingness to accommodate these \nstudents that may be even greater when education is \nprovided to non -knowledgeable professors\n•Educating professors about misophonia is a priority\nREFERENCES\n[1] Cash, T.
