Although recent \nstudies have begun to validate self-report measures of misophonia, no psychometrically validated interviews \nhave been developed. To advance a scientific understanding of misophonia, rigorously developed semi- \nstructured interviews are needed as a complementary measurement approach to self-report inventories. \nAccordingly, the aim of this study was to develop and begin preliminarily validating a semi-structured clinical \ninterview for misophonia. We took an iterative, grassroots approach to item generation and interview devel -\nopment involving key stakeholders (i.e., misophonia sufferers, experts in the field). Initial psychometric analyses \nfrom the current sample (n 30) evidenced excellent preliminary estimates for internal consistency, convergent, \ndiscriminant, and predictive validity. Results from this study provide preliminary support for the Duke Miso-\nphonia Interview, and we recommend that this interviewer-rated measure be iteratively developed and refined \nusing larger and more diverse samples.   \nMisophonia is a disorder marked by decreased tolerance, as well as \nsensory and emotional over-responsivity to repetitive sounds (“trig-\ngers”) and related stimuli (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, \n2002, 2014 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). \nTriggers are typically human-produced, pattern-based oral and/or nasal \nnoises (e.g., throat clearing, chewing, slurping, sniffing) or can be \nenvironmentally produced (e.g., pen clicking, keyboard typing, dog \ndrinking), and are not attributable to aversive acoustic features such as \nvolume or pitch (Brout et al., 2018 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ; Taylor, 2017 ). \nAlthough auditory triggers are most common in misophonia, individuals \nmay also report distress in response to visual triggers (e.g., leg shaking, \nfoot tapping, fan spinning; Swedo et al., 2021 ), as well as visual re-\nminders of auditory triggers (e.g., watching someone open the \nrefrigerator). \nThe intensity of emotional reactions to triggers is expressed across a \nrange of affective responses (e.g., anger, anxiety, disgust, rage) and \nphysiological reactivity (e.g., muscle tension, increased heart rate, \nheightened galvanic skin response; Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jastreboff & \nJastreboff, 2001 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Individuals responding to \nmisophonic triggers report difficulty disengaging their attention from the sounds, as well as aversive and negative thoughts (e.g., “I hate this \nperson ” or “I can't stand it”), sometimes accompanied by urges toward \naggression (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ). Common \nbehavioral responses include glaring at or mimicking the person pro-\nducing the sound, verbal agitation or aggression, and infrequent phys-\nical aggression, all of which adversely impact interpersonal functioning \n(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ). In additional to interpersonal aggression \nand conflict, escape and avoidance behavior functions to prevent \nexposure to and distress from misophonic cues. \nIntolerance of possible triggering contexts (e.g., family meals and \nrestaurants, certain workplaces) may lead to diminished confidence and \nability to regulate emotions over time (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Wu \net al., 2014 ). For example, among participants recruited from online \nsupport groups with misophonia, 78% reported spending over an hour \neach day thinking about misophonic sounds and reported moderate to \nextreme interference in social and/or academic and work life (e.g., \nstrained relationships, social isolation, inability to perform important \nwork tasks, to keep jobs; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ). \nThe level of impairment and distress associated with misophonia makes \nclear the importance of both developing and utilizing evidence-based \n*Corresponding author at: Cognitive Behavioral Research and Treatment Program, Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation, Department of Psychology and \nNeuroscience, Duke University Medical Center, United States. \nE-mail address: rachel.guetta@duke.edu (R.E.

Central to answering these outstanding questions is the \ndevelopment and validation of empirically derived assessments that \nadequately capture the heterogeneity of misophonic symptom \npresentations. \n1.Utility of a clinical interview \nRecent studies have begun to validate self-report inventories \nassessing symptoms and features of misophonia. For example, the \nMisophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ), Amsterdam Misophonia \nScale (Naylor et al., 2020 ), Misophonia Response Scale (Dibb, Golding, \n& Dozier, 2021 ), MisoQuest (Siepsiak et al., 2020 ), and Duke Miso-\nphonia Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ) each have shown \npreliminary psychometric validation, and, collectively, provide prom -\nising new tools to help clinicians and researchers characterize miso-\nphonia. Despite the value of self-report assessment measures (e.g., brief, \naccessible, convenient), however, there are inherent problems with \nrelying solely on these measurement approaches. \nThe focus of most self-report measures has been on types of triggers \n(e.g., oral, nasal, environmental, etc.), symptoms (e.g., physiological, \nemotional, and behavioral responses), and subjective appraisals of \nfunctional impairment (e.g., social, occupational, acadmic). Although \nsuch narrow focus is sensible in the context of brief measurement, little \nattention has been given to a more holistic understanding of the scope of \naffective, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological processes that occur \nin response to triggers, or to how misophonia affects one's self-concept. \nIt is important to move beyond subjective assessment of triggers, \nsymptoms, and impairment in order to obtain a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of an individual's experience of misophonia. In doing so, \nassessment can improve treatment by informing how to flexibly apply \ninterventions capable of targeting of idiographic problems using nom-\nothetically derived and empirically supported processes of change (e.g., \ncognitively, behaviorally, or physiologically-focused interventions). \nExisting instruments also have weaknesses common among self- \nreport measures, including response biases (e.g., acquiescence or nay-\nsaying biases), variable and nonspecific interpretations of questions, and \nreductive responses, all of which can be partially overcome using semi- \nstructured clinical interviews (e.g., Widiger & Saylor, 1998 ). For \nexample, when administering a semi-structured interview, responses \ncan be followed with probes and prompts in order to enhance the pre-\ncision and accuracy of responses. Integrating follow-up questions in \nclinical interviews allows the interviewer to (a) clarify contextual details \nunderlying questions/responses, (b) address ambiguous responses or \nparticipant uncertainty, (c) confirm the frequency, intensity, and dura-\ntion of individual symptoms, and (d) situate symptom severity within \nthe context of both the individual (idiographically) and what is empir -\nically and clinically considered subthreshold versus threshold (nom -\nothetically). Collectively, the advantages of using semi-structured \ninterviews offer greater precision, scope, and treatment utiity than brief \nself-report inventories in the measurement of misophonia. \n2.Current study \nThe primary aim of the present study was to develop and conduct \nexploratory psychometric analyses of a new semi-structured clinical \ninterview to assess misophonia in adults. The a priori goals were to \ncreate and evaluate items representing an individual's: (a) current fre-\nquency of being affected by misophonic triggers, (b) degree of \nresponding to triggers across affective, physiological, cognitive and \nbehavioral domains of functioning, (c) social and occupational impairment caused by misophonia over one's lifetime, as well as (d) \nimpact of misophonia on beliefs about the self. These items were \ngenerated rigorously using qualitative and quantitative approaches in \nthe initial validation of the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ; for \ndetails, see Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). The present interview was developed \nto complement the DMQ and other self-report measures of misophonia, \nwith the intention of being administered in both research and clinical \nsettings to comprehensively characterize the heterogenous nature of \nmisophonia. \nThe development of the clinical interview was scaffolded by assess -\nment standards for creating new interview measures (Watson, 1990 ; \nWatson et al., 1991 ), including: (a) correspondence with proposed \ndiagnostic criteria in order to promote generalizability and external \nvalidity; (b) inclusion of both dichotomous and continuous ratings to \nprovide critical information about presence or absence of the condition \nin addition to dimensional characterization of severity; (c) ability to be \ntrainable among paraprofessionals in order to contribute a scalable and \nbroadly useful instrument; and (d) adequate reliability and validity. We \nalso referenced several widely used and psychometrically validated \nclinical interviews, including the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for \nDSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers et al., 2018 ) and the Anxiety Disorders \nInterview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5; Brown & Barlow, 2014 ), and \nincorporated principles articulated by the creators of these instruments. \nFirstly, we aimed to craft clear and concise questions. Secondly, we \nincorporated behavioral anchors derived from clinical experience with \nmisophonia sufferers in the community and pilot data into the rating \nsystem in order to improve reliability and reduce rater bias (Blake et al., \n1995 ). We also created dimensional ratings for symptoms that integrate \nboth frequency and intensity in order to capture a more individualized \nsymptom presentation and provide clinically useful information to re-\nsearchers and clinicians alike. Such granular analysis of symptom \nseverity affords an idiographic and flexible account of misophonia. For \nexample, one individual may experience relatively frequent but mildly \ndistressing misophonia symptoms, whereas another may experience less \nfrequent symptoms but markedly more distress. This division of fre-\nquency and distress into a dimensional severity score may bolster the \ntreatment utility of the assessment (Hayes et al., 1987 ; Weathers et al., \n2018 ). Lastly, we incorporated interview questions that assess both \ncurrent symptomatology and global impact and we were careful to use \nclear wording to distinguish between time frames. \n3.Methods \nAll study procedures were approved by an IRB and all participants \nprovided informed consent before beginning study procedures. Devel -\noped at Duke University's Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regula -\ntion, the Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI) was developed in two phases \nand was designed to overcome the limitations of existing measures of \nmisophonia. In Phase 1, the interview items were generated using a \nliterature review, responses to an initial version of the interview from \nboth misophonia experts and a pilot sample of 10 misophonia sufferers, \nand iterative feedback from professionals. Phase 2 involved exploratory \npsychometric assessment among a larger sample of misophonia sufferers \n(n 30). A summary of the methodology used to develop the DMI is \ndepicted in Fig. 1a-c. Details of each element in this flowchart are \ndescribed below. \n3.1. Phase 1a: development of interview \n3.1.1. Literature review to identify candidate items \nTo identify candidate items for the interview, a comprehensive \nliterature search for existing proposed diagnostic criteria and tools to \nassess misophonia was conducted. Proposed diagnostic criteria identi -\nfied were from Schroder et al. (2013) and Dozier et al. (2017) . None of \nthese proposed criteria have been empirically tested, and as such, none \nof the offered criteria have been widely accepted. Items from the R.E. Guetta et al."

Items from the Dozier et al. \ngroup integrated into the interview included assessing the source of the \nmisophonic triggers, physiological and affective responses to triggers \nduring and after the misophonic response, and interference in work, \nschool, and interpersonal functioning. Measures identified included the \nMisophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 ), Amsterdam Miso-\nphonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schroder et al., 2013 ), Misophonia Assessment \nQuestionnaire (MAQ; Johnson, 2014 ), Misophonia Activation Scale \n(MAS-1; Fitzmaurice, 2010 ), Misophonia Physiological Response Scale \n(MPRS; Bauman, 2015 ), Misophonia Coping Responses Scale (MCR; \nJohnson, 2014 ), and Misophonia Emotional Responses Scale (MER; \nDozier, 2015 ). All items across these measures were reviewed and \nconstructs (e.g., emotional, behavioral, physiological) were consoli -\ndated into semi-structured interview questions. These steps resulted in \nan initial pool of 26 candidate interview items. \n3.1.2. Creation of individual interview \nNext, a semi-structured interview was developed to ensure that the \nincluded items would comprehensively capture the current experience \nof individuals with misophonia. Features of the interview included (a) \ndichotomous (present/absent) responses for each individual symptom in \nthe past month, (b) separate ratings for symptom frequency and in-\ntensity, culminating in a dimensional rating, (c) prompts, follow-up \nprobes, and behavioral anchors for each dimensional rating scale in \norder to increase reliability (Blake et al., 1995 ), (d) functional impair -\nment ratings for each past-month symptom, and (e) several questions \nassessing global (lifetime) impact of misophonia on the individual. See \nFig. 2a-b for examples of interview items. \nThe first question established presence or absence of trigger sounds, \nas well as frequency and distress of the sounds. The next series of \nquestions assessed cognitive, emotional, physiological, and behavioral misophonic responses. The last several questions assessed impact of \nmisophonia on relationships, school, work, and important hobbies, be-\nliefs about the self, and overall quality of life across the individual's \nlifetime. \n3.1.3. Scoring of the DMI \n3.1.3.1. Dichotomous ratings for current symptoms. Prompts for each \nitem began with a description of the symptom to assess presence or \nabsence, and if the respondent endorsed the symptom, all follow-up \nprompts in the item were administered. If the respondent did not \nendorse presence of the given symptom, the interviewer moved on to the \nnext symptom and the item was scored as a 0. \n3.1.3.2. Dimensional severity ratings for current symptoms. Each past- \nmonth symptom included both frequency and distress ratings, which \ngot converted into a single, dimensional severity rating (Weathers et al., \n2018 ). First, symptom frequency was recorded directly as reported by \nthe individual, and distress was captured using a subjective unit of \ndistress (SUDS) rating from 1 to 10. Respondents were asked to generate \npersonally-relevant behavioral anchors, with 1 being the level of distress \nduring a moment or event that represented the calmest the individual \nhad been in their life and 10 being the level of distress during a moment \nor event that represented the height of distress in their life. This allowed \nthe respondent to situate the distress from each misophonia symptom \nwithin the context of their life stressors more broadly. Distress was rated \nas “minimal ” (SUDS rating 1–3), “clearly present ” (SUDS rating 4–5), \n“pronounced ” (SUDS rating 6–8), or “extreme ” (SUDS rating 9–10). \nNext, derived from psychometrically validated, clinician-rated \nscoring rules (Weathers et al., 1999 ; Weathers et al., 2018 ), frequency \nand distress ratings were converted into a 5-point severity rating (0 \nabsent , 1 mild, 2 moderate , 3 severe , 4 extreme ).

For example, a moderate severity rating for most \nitems required symptom frequency to be at least once a day over the past \nmonth and for distress to be clearly present. \n3.1.3.3. Continuous ratings for current impairment. After collecting fre-\nquency and distress ratings for each past-month symptom, the inter-\nviewer followed prompts to ask about the extent to which that symptom \nhad impacted their relationships with others, their ability to work or \nquality of work, as well as any other adverse impact on their day-to-day \nlife that month. Impairment was rated by the interviewer on a 3-point \nLikert scale (0 no functional impairment to to 2 functional impairment ), based on the rating system derived in the Structured Clin-\nical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5; First, 2014 ). Impairment ratings \nincorporated information such as behavioral observations of the \nrespondent, information gained earlier within that item and throughout \ninterview, and judgment based on respondent reporting style. \n3.1.3.4. Continuous ratings for global impact. After the assessment of \npast-month symptoms, the interview included several items about the \noverall impact of misophonia on relationships, school and occupation, \nself-concept and image, and subjective distress over one's lifetime. Each \nof these items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (absent) to 4 \n(extreme). Global impact ratings incorporated factors such as degree of \nsubjective distress, behavioral observations and information gained \nthroughout interview, and judgment regarding reporting style. \n3.1.3.5. Outcome scores. The interview yielded four scores: (a) total \nDMI score (a sum of all dimensional severity ratings for each past-month \nsymptom and continuous ratings for each global impact item), (b) cur-\nrent severity score (a sum of all dimensional severity ratings for each \npast-month symptom), (c) current impairment score (a sum of all \ncontinuous impairment ratings), and (d) global impact score (a sum of \nall continuous lifetime effect ratings). A summary of the division of \nitems and DMI outcome scores is depicted in Table 1. \n3.1.3.6. Pilot study. Participants were individuals with misophonia (n \n10) and were included if they were between the ages of 18 and 65, did \nnot meet criteria for current mania, anorexia nervosa, or psychosis as \ndetermined by formal diagnostic interviewing via the Structured Clin-\nical Interview for the DSM- 5 (SCID-5; First, 2014 ), and scored a mean \nitem score of 2 or greater on the Misophonia Symptom Scale and \nMisophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale and a score of 7 or higher on \nthe Severity Scale of the Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ). \n3.2. Phase 1b: refinement of initial item pool \n3.2.1. Feedback on item wording, structure, and applicability from \nmisophonia sufferers \nIn addition to responding to the interview items themselves, the \nsame participants as in Phase 1a (n 10) provided free response feed-\nback on each item and offered changes or additions to the interview, \nincluding length, content, scoring criteria, wording of instructions, and \ncomprehensibility of items. Participant feedback was discussed by the \nstudy team, and changes were incorporated to enhance accessibility \nand/or clarity of the instructions. Items flagged as confusing or redun -\ndant were either removed or condensed. \n3.2.2. Feedback from experts \nThe iterated interview was sent to several clinicians and professional \nexperts. Expert feedback was reviewed and incorporated by the study \nteam. Changes included clarifying instructions and including additional \nrelevant items (e.g., functional impairment items for each misophonic \nsymptom). \n3.2.3. Study team qualitative review \nAs the final step in Phase 1, members of the study team reviewed the \niterated interview and made additional refinements to increase clarity \nand specificity of the interview items. This included further collapsing \nand/or parsing questions and further simplification of instructions and \nresponse options. After completion of all Phase 1b modifications, 19 \nitems were prepared for Phase 2 data collection and initial psychometric \nanalyses. \n3.3.

Misophonia questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 ).The MQ is a \nbrief, 17-item self-report scale divided into three subscales: the Miso-\nphonia Symptom Subscale, the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors \nSubscale, and the Impairment Subscale. A cut score of 7 (“Moderate ”) or \nhigher on the Impairment Subscale indicates clinically significant \nmisophonia symptomology. Initial validation of the MQ demonstrated \ngood internal consistency (α 0.86 –0.89; Wu et al., 2014 ). Reliability \nfor the MQ total score in the current sample was acceptable (α 0.72; \n95% CI [0.55, 0.85]). \n3.3.2.2. Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schroder et al., \n2013 ).The A-MISO-S is a 6-item semi-structured interview that assesses \nthe following: (1) amount of time occupied by misophonia symptoms; \n(2) interference in social functioning from misophonia; (3) level of \ngeneral distress (irritation, anger, disgust) the misophonia symptoms \ncause the individual; (4) level of effort for the individual to resist or \ndivert attention from misophonia impulses (i.e. sound-related thoughts); \n(5) how much control the individual feels they have over their \nmisophonia-related thoughts; and (6) how much an individual avoids \nmisophonia situations. In the current study, this measure was adminis -\ntered as a self-report questionnaire rather than an interview. Scores from \n0 to 4 are considered subclinical misophonic symptoms, 5–9 mild, 10–14 \nmoderate, 15–19 severe, and 20–24 extreme. A good internal consis -\ntency of 0.81 was reported (Naylor et al., 2020 ). Reliability of the A- \nMISO-S total score in the current sample was adequate (α 0.68; 95% CI [0.46, 0.83]). \n3.3.2.3. Brief symptom inventory (BSI-18; Derogatis, 2001 ).The BSI-18 \nis an abridged version of the 53-item BSI developed to identify self- \nreported clinically relevant psychological symptoms. The BSI-18 is a \nchecklist developed as a screen for symptoms ranging from depression, \npanic, to anxiety. Each symptom is rated on a five-point Likert scale with \nresponses ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Extremely ”), with total \nscores ranging from 0 to 72. Higher total scores indicate higher global \npsychological distress. Initial validation of the BSI-18 total score \ndemonstrated good internal consistency (α 0.89; Zabora et al., 2001 ). \nReliability for the BSI-18 total score in the current sample was excellent \n(α 0.91; 95% CI [0.86, 0.95]). \n3.3.2.4. Centrality of Religiosity Scale (CRS; Huber & Huber, 2012 ).The \nCRS is a 15-item self-report scale assessing the significance of spirituality \nin individuals' lives, and was included to assess for discriminant validity. \nThe measure was designed to measure five dimensions of religiosity: (1) \nIntellect, (2) Ideology, (3) Public practice, (4) Private practice, and (5) \nExperience. The CRS demonstrated good internal consistency (α 0.73 \nto 0.83; Abbasi-Asl et al., 2019 ). Reliability for the CRS in the current \nsample was good (α 0.83; 95% CI [0.73, 0.91]). \n3.3.2.5. Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSD; Reynolds, \n1982 ).This 13-item tool utilizing a true-false response format that \nassess the impact of social desirability, the tendency to report answers in \na way that individuals deem to be socially acceptable. The MCSD was \nincluded to assess for discriminant validity. Total scores range from 0 to \n13, with higher scores indicating a social desirability response tendency. \nThe MCSD was validated in a large college sample and evidenced \nacceptable reliability α 0.76; Reynolds, 1982 ). Reliability for the \nMCSD in the current sample was good (α 0.83; 95% CI [0.72, 0.91]). \n3.3.3. Data analytic plan \nData analyses were conducted in SPSS version 27 (IBM Corp, 2020 ). \nDescriptive statistics were calculated for all measures administered, \nincluding tests of normality. Acceptability and feasibility ratings for the \nDMI were also evaluated. We assessed presence or absence of each DMI \ninterview item using a rule of severity score rating ≽1 to examine Table 3 \nItem-total statistics for DMI items.  \nDMI Item Scale mean if item \ndeleted Scale variance if item \ndeleted Corrected item-total \ncorrelation Squared multiple \ncorrelation Cronbach's Alpha if item \ndeleted \n1.

Prevalence rates were also used to flag \npotential items to eliminate in future iterations of the interview. Given \nthe preliminary nature of this study, confidence intervals are presented \nto point estimates and significance testing throughout the results \n(Cooper, 2018 ). \n3.3.3.1. Internal reliability. To refine the DMI using exploratory psy-\nchometric analyses, we examined means and standard deviations for \neach individual item, as well as for each DMI outcome score. We \ncalculated total and summary scores on the DMI and evaluated internal \nconsistency and inter-scale correlations in order to describe the re-\nlationships between assessed constructs and further explore conceptual \ngroupings of the DMI outcome scores. Cronbach's alphas were computed \nfor all interview items (total DMI score), as well for the three subscores \n(current symptom severity, current impairment, and global impact \nscores). In addition, confidence intervals were calculated for the coef-\nficient alphas (Cooper, 2018 ). Item-total correlations were examined for \nall outcome scores. Items with item-total correlations less than 0.30 \nwere removed from subsequent analyses (Brzoska & Razum, 2010 ; \nCristobal et al., 2007 ; De Vaus, 2004 ; Maltby et al., 2007 ; Pedhazur & \nSchmelkin, 2013 ). \n3.3.3.2. Test re-test reliability. We evaluated one month test-retest reli-\nability among the 30% of the sample (n 9) that was randomized to a \nfollow-up visit in order to quantify test consistency over time. Bivariate \ncorrelations were computed between baseline and follow-up timepoints \nfor DMI outcome scores. \n3.3.3.3. External validation using existing measures. Concurrent validity \nwas examined by estimating correlations with external measures of \nmisophonia and symptoms of broader psychopathology. Pearson \nbivariate correlations were conducted between DMI total score and \nsubscores with the MQ and A-MISO-S for measures of misophonia, as \nwell as the BSI-18 for a measure of general psychopathology. 3.3.3.4. Discriminant validity. Discriminant validity was examined \namong the same 30% of the sample (n 9) by estimating correlations \nwith external constructs. Pearson bivariate correlations were conducted \nbetween DMI total score and the CRS and the MCSD, as neither religi -\nosity nor social desirability are constructs with theoretical overlap with \nmisophonia. \n3.3.3.5. Predictive validity. Predictive validity was examined by esti-\nmating correlations with external constructs. Pearson bivariate corre -\nlations were conducted between the DMI total score and subscores with \nthe MQ, A-MISO-S, and BSI. \n4.Results \n4.1. Descriptive statistics \nMost participants in the current sample identified as female (n 23, \n76.6%), White (n 27, 90%), and non-Hispanic (n 27). The average \nage of the sample was 35.90 years (SD 12.67). Forty percent of par-\nticipants indicated they were single, never married (n 12), had \ncompleted college (n 12), and had a salary range of above $40,000 (n \n17, 57%). \nThe total scores for the MQ, A-MISO-S, BSI-18, CRS, and MCSD were \nall within normal distribution. Skewness ranged from 0.05 to 1.12; \nkurtosis ranged from \u00000.93 to 1.9 (Gravetter & Wallnau, 2014 ; Trochim \n& Donnelly, 2006 ). The mean score on the MQ Symptom Scale was \n21.60 (SD 4.87) and on the MQ Emotions and Behavior Scale was \n25.60 (SD 5.79), suggesting that on average participants marked re-\nsponses between “sometimes true” and “often true” when asked how \noften they were sensitive to various potential sound triggers, and how \noften they experienced certain emotional and behavioral responses to \nthese triggers. Responses to the MQ Impairment Scale (M 8.73, SD \n1.82) suggest that on average the sample reported “moderate sound \nsensitivities. ” Twenty-nine participants (96.67%) reported “clinically \nsignificant symptoms ” on the MQ (i.e., ≽7 on the impairment subscale Table 4 \nInter-item Bivariate Correlations for Total Scores (α 0.91). \nR.E.

The mean total score on the A-MISO-S was 13.87 (SD \n3.10), suggesting that on average participants marked responses be-\ntween “mild ” and “moderate ” when asked about the frequency, inter-\nference, and distress, as well as levels of resistance, control, and \navoidance of misophonic cues in the past week. Responses to the BSI-18 \n(M 13.83, SD 10.51) suggest that on average participants had mild \nanxiety, depression, and/or somatization symptoms. Acceptability and \nfeasibility ratings for the DMI were, on average, both rated between \n“very acceptable ” and “extremely acceptable ” (M 4.63, SD 0.56 and \n0.62, respectively). \n4.2. Prevalence of DMI item endorsement \nTo examine endorsement of DMI interview items, we computed \nfrequencies of all 19 items. Current misophonia items on the DMI were \nendorsed by 100% of the current sample (symptom presence defined by \nseverity rating ≽1; Table 2), suggesting strong face validity of the DMI \nitems. \n4.3. Preliminary internal reliability \nIn order to explore preliminary internal reliability of the DMI, we \ncalculated summary scores on the DMI interview and examined inter- \nitem and item-total correlations, as well as Cronbach's alphas among \nDMI outcome scores. Internal reliability of the total DMI score was \nexcellent: Cronbach's alpha coefficient for all 19 interview items was α \n0.90 (95% CI [0.84, 0.95]). Item-total correlations among all inter-\nview items were strong, as all items except one had item-total correla -\ntions between 0.32 and 0.76 (see Table 3). Item #7, assessing worry for a \nlot of the time about future noises, had an item-total correlation of \n\u00000.04 and produced a higher Cronbach's alpha when the value was \ndeleted. As such, Item #7 was excluded from remaining analyses; 18 of \nthe 19 items were retained in subsequent analyses. \nInter-item correlations between each of the retained 18 items are \ndisplayed in Table 4. Mean total score of all retained 18 items on the DMI \nwas 31.67 (SD 10.98), out of a maximum of 72 points. Cronbach's \nalpha for the total DMI score was excellent (α 0.91; 95% CI [0.86, \n0.95]; see Table 5), and average inter-item correlation (AIC) for the DMI \nwas 0.36. Mean current severity score was 18.40 (SD 7.34), out of a \nmaximum of 48 points for the 12 items. Cronbach's alpha for the current \nseverity score items was strong (α 0.86; 95% CI [0.78, 0.92]) and AIC \nwas 0.33. Mean current impairment score was 10.30 (SD 6.57), out of \na maximum of 24 points for the 12 items. Cronbach's alpha for the \ncurrent impairment score items was strong (α 0.86; 95% CI [0.78, \n0.92]) and AIC was 0.33. Mean global impact score was 8.60 (SD \n3.45), out of a maximum of 16 points for the four items. Cronbach's \nalpha for the global impact score items was excellent (α 0.88; 95% CI \n[0.81, 0.93]) and AIC was 0.68. Further, inter-scale correlations be-\ntween the DMI total score and current severity, current impairment, and \nglobal impact scores were all significant (rs 0.96, 0.74, 0.78, respectively, ps D0.001). Correlations among the three scores were also \nsignificant (see Table 6). \nTaken together, the (a) high endorsement of DMI interview items, (b) \nstrong Cronbach's alphas across the four DMI outcome scores, (c) AICs \nfor the DMI total, current severity, and current impairment scores within \nrecommended range (Clark & Watson, 1995 ), and (d) inter-scale cor-\nrelations between the DMI outcome scores provide preliminary evidence \nof internal reliability for the DMI. \n4.4. Test re-test reliability \nTest-retest reliability of the DMI was explored by computing bivar -\niate correlations between DMI scores from the baseline assessment and \nthe follow-up visit among the 30% of participants randomized to follow- \nup. Pearson correlation coefficients between the DMI total scores (r \n0.95, p D.0001; 95% CI [0.89, 0.99]), current severity scores (r 0.94, \np D.0001; 95% CI [0.86, 0.98]), current impairment scores (r 0.88, p \n.002; 95% CI [0.73, 0.97]), and global impact scores (r 0.995, p D\n.0001; 95% CI [0.98, 0.99]) at both time points were all strongly and \npositively correlated. Consistent with large correlation coefficient effect \nsizes (Cohen, 1988 ), these findings support preliminary evidence of test \nre-test reliability for the DMI. \n4.5. External validation \nNext, to assess preliminary concurrent validity between the DMI and \nexisting measures of misophonia, bivariate correlations were conducted. \nPearson correlations indicated that the MQ total score and A-MISO-S \ntotal score in the current sample were positively correlated with each \nother (r 0.50, p .005). As hypothesized, preliminary evidence of \nconvergent validity was observed in correlations between the MQ and \nDMI (see Table 7). Similarly, there was evidence of significant, positive \ncorrelations between the A-MISO-S and some DMI scores. In order to \nexamine convergent validity between the DMI and general psychopa -\nthology, correlations were computed between the DMI and BSI-18. \nBivariate correlations between BSI-18 and DMI total (r 0.42, p \n.020), current impairment (r 0.49, p .006), and global impact (r \n0.54, p .002) scores were consistent with moderate correlation coef-\nficient effect sizes (Cohen, 1988 ). DMI current severity score was not \ncorrelated with BSI-18 total score. Taken together, these results indicate \npreliminary evidence of concurrent validity for the DMI. \n4.6. Discriminant validity \nTo examine preliminary discriminant validity, correlations were \nconducted between the DMI and the CRS and MCSD. Results suggest that \nthe DMI was not significantly related to either religiosity (r 0.05, p \n.912) or social desirability (r \u00000.03, p .868). These findings suggest \npreliminary discriminant validity for the DMI. Table 5 \nInter-item bivariate correlations for DMI impairment score (α 0.86).  \nDMI Item 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \n2.

Predictive validity \nLastly, bivariate correlations were conducted between DMI at initial \nassessment visit and self-report measures of misophonia and general \npsychopathology for the subset of the sample that was randomized to the \nfollow-up visit (n 9). Pearson correlations indicated that DMI total \nscore was positively correlated with MQ emotions and behavior subscale \n(r 0.81, p .008), MQ severity score (r 73, p .025; 95% CI [0.57, \n0.95]) and A-MISO-S total score at follow up (r 0.71, p .032; 95% CI \n[0.34, 92]). DMI total score was not correlated with MQ total score at \nfollow up or BSI-18 total score at follow up. These findings provide \npreliminary evidence of predictive validity of the DMI. \n5.Discussion \nThe overarching aim of this study was to develop and begin to psy-\nchometrically validate a semi-structured clinical interview to assess \nmisophonia in adults. In addition to establishing symptom presence, as \nwell as severity and impairment in functioning from misophonia, we \nalso incorporated items that capture a broad spectrum of responses to \ntriggers across affective, cognitive, physiological, and behavioral do-\nmains. The interview assesses ways in which these response strategies \nare effective and/or ineffective, as well as dysfunctional beliefs related \nto misophonia. There were two phases of interview development. In \nPhase 1, interview items were generated and iteratively refined from \nboth a scientific literature review and qualitative feedback from miso-\nphonia sufferers and experts. In Phase 2, a separate sample of adults was \nrecruited to complete the DMI and other measures in order to assess \nexploratory psychometric properties. A third of participants were ran-\ndomized to a follow-up visit in order to begin assesssing test-retest \nreliability and predictive validity. Iterative analytic procedures (e.g., \nestimated item-total correlations) were used to derive proposed final \nDMI items. From the overall item pool, the final DMI consists of 18 \nitems, and includes four outcome scores: (1) Total DMI score (all 18 \nitems), (2) Current severity score (12 items), (3) Current impairment \nscore (12 items), and (4) Global impact score (4 items). \nThe DMI is the first semi-structured clinical interview for misophonia \ndeveloped using iterative, grassroots methods integrating suggestions \nand feedback directly from key stakeholders (i.e., individuals with \nmisophonia and experts in the field). Our approach to interview devel -\nopment was conducted to optimize interview accessibility and applica -\nbility in both research and clinical settings, and to limit investigator \nbiases or assumptions about misophonia that could influence the in-\nclusion or exclusion of interview items. This study suggests that the DMI \nincludes reliable and valid scores reflecting a wide range of responses to \nmisophonia. Intercorrelations between DMI scores indicated strong relationships between constructs. For example, the current severity, \ncurrent impairment, and global impact scores correlated strongly with \nDMI total score. \nAs hypothesized, the DMI was significantly positively correlated with \nextant self-report measures of misophonia, including the MQ (Wu et al., \n2014 ) and A-MISO-S (Schroder et al., 2013 ), and a general measure of \npsychopathology (BSI; Derogatis, 2001 ), supporting the preliminary \nconvergent validity of the DMI. Further, the DMI was not correlated with \nmeasures of religiosity and social desirability, two constructs with no a \npriori theoretical overlap with misophonia, suggesting preliminary \ndiscriminant validity of the DMI. Test-retest reliability between the two \nassessment timepoints were strong. Correlations between the DMI at \nbaseline and the A-MISO-S as well as certain MQ subscales were \nsignificantly positively correlated, indicating preliminary adequate \npredictive validity of the DMI. \nThe full DMI may be used to assess misophonia symptoms, functional \nimpairment, response patterns to triggers, beliefs associated with the \ndisorder, and the global impact of misophonia symptomatology. In \naddition, DMI subscores can be utilized to investigate changes in specific \nprocesses during treatment for misophonia. Researchers and/or clini-\ncians examining intervention outcomes on patterns of thinking and \nphysiological responses in misophonia could use the DMI current \nseverity score as an endpoint. Similarly, the impact of interventions on \nimpairment could be investigated using the DMI impairment score. \nThe results of this study should be considered within the context of \nits limitations. First, it should also be noted that, despite the iterative, \ngrassroots approach taken for item generation and inclusion, in light of \nthe heterogeneity of misophonia, any given individual completing the \nDMI may report other features not captured by the DMI. Second, our \nsample in Phase 2 was largely homogenous (i.e., mostly White, female \nparticipants) and small (n 30), which may limit the reliability and \nvalidity of the measure. The size of the subsample for test-retest and \npredictive validity (n 9) may have inflated correlation coefficients \nthrough possible non-normality. Future research should replicate and \nextend our preliminary findings and evaluate the DMI using larger, more \ndiverse clinical and general population samples which may provide \nuseful insight into phenotypic differences on the DMI. Efforts to diversify \nfuture samples may include incorporating a demographic survey and \nprioritizing enrollment of underrepresented participants. The inclusion \nof comparison samples of non-misophonic participants may also func-\ntion to validate the face validity of the interview items as discriminating \nbetween those with and without misophonia. Third, preliminary psy-\nchometric examination of the DMI was limited by not conducting inter- \nrater reliability. Validation studies of the DMI should include adminis -\ntration by multiple clinicians, researchers, and/or paraprofessionals, \nand include inter-rater reliability findings. Next, despite the enhanced \nprecision and accuracy that semi-structured clinical interviewing is able \nto achieve, quantifying frequency, duration, and intensity of symptoms \nstill may be vulnerable to response biases, variable interpretations of \nquestions and limitations in respondents' ability to quantify subjective \nexperience. For example, social desireability in presentation to the \ninterviewer could lead to either under- or over-reporting; variable in-\nterpretations of what respondents' consider to be functionally impairing \ncould limit validity. As such, laboratory-based behavioral paradigms to \nassess misophonia in addition to structured clinical interviews could \nhelp offset these limitations. Lastly, there were weak but positive cor-\nrelations between the DMI scores with existing measures of misophonia, \nlikely due to sample size and lack of power to detect stronger correla -\ntions. In the next phase of validation studies of the DMI, inclusion of \nother self-report measures of misophonia with stronger psychometric \nproperties (e.g., DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ) is warranted. \n5.1.

Specifically, additions to the interview that reflect the \nconsensus definition may include: more in-depth questions about in-\nfluences on misophonic reactions (e.g., perceived degree of control over \nstimulus), attentional reactions (e.g., hyperfocus or obsession), and \ncoping strategies to manage misophonia. Relatedly, additional input \nfrom interdisciplinary subspecialities (e.g., audiology, occupational \ntherapy, neuroscience, otolaryngology) should be considered in future \niterations to continue limiting investigator bias, and increasing acces -\nsibility, feasibility, and clinical utility of the DMI. \nAdditional future directions for the interview may include creation \nof a shorter version. DMI administration in this study took between 45 \nand 90 min. A briefer version of the DMI may be preferred in some \ncontexts, especially so that DMI administration could fit within a stan-\ndard psychotherapy session. One approach to shortening the DMI may \nbe removing items with low rates of endorsement. For example, Items \n#3 (rumination about prior sounds) and #14 (self-harm) were endorsed \nby less than 30% of the current sample, indicating preliminary empirical \nbasis for removal. Further research using larger samples is needed to \nreliably identify items for removal based on this criterion. In addition to \ndeveloping a briefer version of the DMI for adults, adaption of the DMI to \nindividuals under the age of 18 is warranted, as emerging evidence \nhighlights that the onset of misophonia may be during childhood (Jager \net al., 2020 ). In addition to iterative changes to the interview and ad-\naptations of the DMI, future studies should focus on training para-\nprofessionals to administer the DMI in order to increase both clinical and \nresearch utility. \n5.2. Conclusions \nThe DMI was developed as the first semi-structured clinical interview \nfor misophonia to overcome the limitations of existing measures for this \nnew disorder. Although preliminary, initial results evaluating the DMI \nsatisfy the majority of proposed interview standards (Watson, 1990 ), \nincluding correspondence with proposed diagnostic criteria, inclusion of \nboth dichotomous and continuous ratings, and adequate reliability and \nvalidity. Though validation and research on the integration of the DMI \ninto varied clinical and research settings is needed, preliminary findings \nsuggest the DMI may have excellent internal consistency, test re-test \nreliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and predictive \nvalidity. This study offers promising preliminary evidence for a clini-\ncally and empirically useful tool to understand misophonia, a new and \nunderstudied disorder. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nRachel Guetta: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, \nFormal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing, Visualization, Project administration.
