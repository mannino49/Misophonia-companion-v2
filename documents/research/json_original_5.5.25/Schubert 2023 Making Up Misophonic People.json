Zillien  \n1  Introduction:  The  hatred  of  noisesOn  the  Popularization  of  a  Medical  Category  in  Social  Media  \nAnyone  who  feels  strongly  disturbed  by  the  everyday  noises  of  other  people  and  \nsometimes  reacts  with  aggression  or  avoidance  behavior  to  chewing  and  smacking  \nnoises,  breathing,  clearing  their  throat,  foot  tapping  or  finger  drumming  will  quickly  \ncome  across  other  sufferers  if  they  do  the  appropriate  online  research.  Thousands  \nof  posts  on  Instagram,  Twitter  or  Reddit,  in  podcasts,  self-help  forums  and  \nYouTube  videos  report  the  psychological  and  physical  suffering  that  everyday  \nnoises  can  cause.  Those  affected  exchange  ideas  on  the  social  web  about  which  \nvery  different  noises  trigger  the  anger,  what  uncertainty,  shame  and  sometimes  \ndecades  of  torment  this  is  associated  with,  and  to  what  extent  the  social  \nenvironment  is  filled  with  helplessness,  lack  of  understanding  or  even  support  \n-zung  reacts,  which  coping  strategies  seem  promising  and  what  effects  can  occur,  \nfrom  social  withdrawal  to  dismissals  at  work  to  massive  partnership  problems.  \nMany  of  those  affected  continue  to  report  the  first  time  a  certain  noise  bothered  \nthem  so  much,  although  it  was  usually  only  much  later  -  and  often  on  the  social  \nweb  -  that  they  found  out  that  they  were  not  alone,  that  others  felt  very  similar  and  \nthat ,  which  is  perhaps  the  most  important  finding,  their  suffering  has  a  scientific  \nname:  “Miso-phonia”  –  the  hatred  of  noises.Abstract  Those  affected  by  misophonia  describe  it  as  one  of  the  first  full-fledged  \ndiagnoses  of  the  internet  age.  People  who  feel  an  insurmountable  hatred  of  specific  \nsounds  gather  in  forums  and  on  platforms.  In  this  chapter,  we  analyze  the  \nemergence  of  misophonia  as  a  medical  category  on  social  media.  We  examine  \nhow  misopho-nia  becomes  a  popular  diagnosis,  how  experts  and  lay  people  refer  \nto  each  other,  and  what  resistance  they  face  in  this  process.  We  understand  the  \ndevelopment  of  the  medical  category  as  »making  up  people«:  as  the  development  \nof  a  group  of  affected  persons  who  identify  closely  with  the  diagnosis  and  vigorously  \nfight  for  its  recognition  as  an  illness.  \nMedical  Sociology  \nMisophonia  is  generally  understood  to  be  a  reduced  tolerance  to  noise,  which,  \ntriggered  by  a  specific  and  usually  everyday  trigger  noise,  results  in  emotional  \nreactions  such  as  irritation,  anger,  aggression,  disgust  or  flight  behavior  as  well  as  \nphysical  reactions  such  as  an  increase  in  blood  pressure  on  the  part  of  those  \naffected ,  breathing  problems,  sweating,  muscle  tension  or  even  racing  heart,  \nwhereby  from  the  observer's  perspective  these  reactions  are  in  a  \"grotesque  \ndisproportionate  to  the  perceived  noise\" (Schwemmle/ Arens  2021,  p.  4)  (see  also  \nFerrer-Torres/Giménez-Llort  2022).  Misophonia  is  not  a  medically  recognized  or  \nclearly  defined  disorder.  she  isKeywords  Misophonia  ·  Social  Media  ·  Medicalisation  ·  Media  Sociology  ·  »Making  Up  Misophonic  People«  Machine Translated by Google"

      "text": "If  you  look  at  misophonia  from  the  perspective  of  medicalization  and  \npopularization,  the  question  arises  whether  the  hatred  of  noises  should  be  \nrecognized  as  a  clinical  picture  or  not.  Rather,  the  media  practices  come  to  the  \nfore  through  which  those  involved  postulate  a  medical  category,  locate  themselves  \nwithin  it  and  fight  for  its  recognition.  Such  emancipatory  communitization  \nprocesses  to  create  a  shared  category  of  people  are  more  common  in  social  \nmedia,  but  particularly  in  the  case  of  rare  and  controversial  diseases.  In  the  case  \nof  the  vague  diagnosis  of  “excessive  daytime  sleepiness” (Kroll- Smith  2003),  it  \nbecomes  clear  that  medical  authority  comes  under  pressure  due  to  the  \npopularized  claims  of  those  affected.  In  these  cases,  “Making-up-people-online”  \nis  operated  by  those  affected  themselves,  which  does  not  mean  that  medical  \nexpertise  is  irrelevant.  Medical  authority  remains  necessary  to  establish  the  \nlegitimacy  of  the  illness,  but  it  is  no  longer  the  primary  driver  for  establishing  the  \nperson  category.  The  groups  of  laypeople  and  experts  cannot  always  be  clearly  \ndistinguished.  Experts  from  health  professions  can  also  be  affected  or  work  online  \nto  recognize  misophonia  and  support  those  affected.  Discourses  from  specialists  \nand  those  affected  sometimes  overlap,  overlap,  reinforce  each  other  and  can  \nthereby  accelerate  the  popularization  of  the  medical  category.\nHowever,  the  shifts  in  the  relationship  between  experts  and  laypeople  in  \nrelation  to  disease  knowledge  point  to  the  specific  role  of  social  media.  In  \nparticular,  they  allow  those  affected  to  generate  and  maintain  attention.  They  \nreceive  attention  not  only  among  themselves,  but  also  in  the  medical  community  \nand  among  relatives  and  friends.  At  the  same  time,  they  have  to  deal  with  critical  \nopposing  voices.  The  fight  over  the  personal  category  “misophonic”  brings  \ntogether  different  interests  and  people  who  formulate  heterogeneous  bodies  of  \nknowledge  and  claims:  from  the  experiential  knowledge  of  those  affected  and  \ntheir  history  of  suffering  to  the  medical  classification  and  description  of  the  \nsymptoms  to  the  incomprehension  of  the  opponents,  consider  misophonia  to  be  \nan  invention  or  imagination  or  not  take  it  seriously  as  a  disease.  Misophonia  can  \nalso  be  counted  publicly  via  social  media  metrics:  in  forums,  posts,  likes  or  \nretweets.  We  will  examine  in  more  detail  how  these  different  configurations  of  \nknowledge  and  people,  experts  and  laypeople  interact  in  the  case  of  misophonia  \nin  the  next  section.practice  of  the  affected  laypeople  or  whether  the  laypeople's  practices  have  not  \nchanged  fundamentally  if  the  medical  and  social  recognition  of  their  illnesses  is  \na  central  motivation.\nThe  medical  exploration  of  noise  hatred  began  around  25  years  ago:  the  \nAmerican  ear  doctor  Marsha  Johnson  is  credited  with  the  early  description  of  \n\"selective  sound  sensitivity  syndrome  (4S)\",  which  she  diagnosed  in  19974  Misophonia  in  the  Social  Web  –  An  Empirical  ApproachC.

With  \nreference  to  the  methodological  specifics  of  corresponding  big  data  analyzes  \n(Pettit  2016),  the  data  generated  by  the  online  tool  used  are  interpreted  here  with  \nall  caution  as  evidence  of  the  way  in  which  the  discourse  on  misophonia  develops.  \nIt  turns  out  that  the  term  appeared  for  the  first  time  in  2001,  but  was  only  found  \nin  low  frequency,  which  remained  largely  the  case  for  a  whole  decade.

      "text": "Due  to  the  quantifying  logic  of  social  media,  the  social  scientific  practice  of  \ncounting,  which  aims  to  record  and  represent  those  who  have  been  classified,  is  \nomnipresent  on  the  Internet.  Since  the  use  of  the  social  web  continually  leaves  \ntraces  of  data,  the  use  of  social  media  is  simultaneously  accompanied  by  the  \nproduction  and  presentation  of  corresponding  numerical  material:  »[E]very  trace  \nwe  enter  into  the  digital  environment  of  social  media  platforms,  whether  direct  or  \nindirect,  visible  or  invisible,  provides  information  about  us” (Casagrande  2022,  p.  \n153).  In  this  sense,  in  the  social  media  negotiation  of  specific  topics,  for  example  \nthe  number  of  posts,  the  number  of  likes,  the  number  of  followers,  friends  or  \nmembers,  the  number  and  frequency  of  comments  or  even  the  extent  of  redirects  \nin  the  context  of  the  corresponding  online  -Interpret  counting  practices.  Unlike  \nthe  standardized  surveys  of  empirical  social  research,  such  as  the  Kinsey  Report,  \nthis  data  was  not  specifically  collected,  does  not  follow  any  methodological  \nsystem  and  does  not  claim  to  be  representative.  Rather,  this  “specifically  digital  \nway  of  knowing” (Marres  2017,  p.  37)  has  explicit  distortions,  which  can  potentially  \nalso  be  turned  productively  (Marres  2017,  p.  123).  And  if  not  representative,  \nthose  affected  by  misophonia  and  their  families  at  least  gain  a  certain  level  of  \nrepresentation  and  visibility,  which  is  reflected  in  the  sheer  volume  of  agreement,  \ncomment  and  support.scientific  practices  can  be  found.  In  a  second  step,  we  focus  on  social  connection  \npractices  on  the  Internet,  assuming  that  the  practices  of  normalization,  \nbureaucratization  and  rebellion  outlined  by  hacking  need  to  be  modified  or  \nexpanded  in  the  digital  age.\nAccordingly,  for  example,  the  website  \"Misophonia  UK\"  states  that  misophonia  is  \n\"one  of  the  first  fully-fledged  diagnoses  of  the  Internet  age\":  While  the  disease  \nwas  previously  \"invisible\",  patients  were  not  taken  seriously  and  did  not  receive  \nmedical  attention  did  not  exist,  this  changed  with  the  exchange  and  mobilization  \nof  those  affected  on  social  media.\nWhat  is  central  in  this  context  is  that  those  affected  learn  online  that  the  hatred  \nof  noises  can  be  identified  with  a  technical  term  that  not  only  allows  for  self-\nlocalization,  but  also  for  community  and  normalization:  »A  common  refrain  is  “I  \nthought  I  was  the  only  one  in  the  world,  until  I  discovered  my  condition  had  a  \nname.  I'm  so  glad  there  are  people  out  thereWith  a  view  to  misophonia-related  online  counting  practices,  for  example,  the  \ndevelopment  and  size  of  social  networks  on  the  topic  can  be  interpreted  as  a  \nrelevance  marker:  the  largest  English-speaking  Facebook  group  on  misophonia,  \nfor  example,  currently  has  25,000  members,  the  largest  German-speaking  \nFacebook  group  now  has  over  3,000  members,  who  largely  are  likely  to  consist  \nof  (self-)classified  people  and  their  social  environment.  It  can  be  assumed  that  \nthis  membership  strength  of  the  misophonia-related  networks  alone  contributes  \nto  a  new  understanding  of  self  and  others  for  those  affected  in  the  sense  of  the  looping  effect.4.2  Social  and  natural  science  practices  onlineC.

      "text": "4.3.3  From  rebellion  to  alliance  formation\nThe  fact  that  the  number  of  Google  searches  on  the  subject  of  misophonia  \nsuddenly  increased  massively  in  September  2011  can  most  likely  be  explained  \nby  an  article  published  in  the  New  York  Times  on  September  5th,  2011.  This  \narticle  was  entitled  “When  a  chomp  or  a  slurp  is  a  trigger  for  outrage” (Cohen  \n2011),  put  the  topic  of  misophonia  on  the  media  agenda  and  quickly  spread,  \nespecially  in  the  USA.  Marsha  Johnson,  mentioned  above,  is  mentioned  as  an  \nexpert  in  the  New  York  Times  article,  not  only  mentioning  her  pioneering  medical  \nwork,  but  also  her  founding  of  the  Yahoo  group  “soundsensitivity,”  which  was  \nalready  used  by  1,700  people  at  the  time .  So  it  is  an  expert  who  is  responsible  \nfor  networking  those  affected  with  one  anotherIn  Hacking's  conception,  the  resistant  practice  of  \"rebellion\"  represents  the  central  \nfollow-up  practice  on  the  part  of  those  affected:  the  assumption  is  that  laypeople  \nwill  rebel  against  the  responsible  experts  in  the  event  of  inadequate  \ncategorizations.  However,  against  the  background  of  our  exemplary  analysis  of  \nsocial  media  exchanges  on  misophonia,  we  would  like  to  claim  that  rebellion  no  \nlonger  adequately  describes  the  common  connection  practices  of  those  affected.  \nInstead  of  a  confrontational  relationship,  it  can  be  observed  that  alliances  of  lay  \npeople  and  experts  are  forming  in  order  to  jointly  promote  the  creation  and  \nestablishment  of  a  new  category  of  people.\nIn  this  sense,  we  compare  the  above  presentation  of  the  scientific  misophonia  \ndiscourse  with  an  analysis  of  the  (internet)  public  exchange  on  the  topic.  It  turns  \nout  that  the  popularization  practices  on  the  social  web  fuel  the  scientific  discourse  \non  misophonia.  An  evaluation  using  the  analysis  tool  Google  Trends  provides  a  \nfirst  impression  of  the  (internet)  public  interest  in  the  topic  of  misophonia.  Since  \n2004,  Google  Trends  has  been  able  to  show  how  the  weekly  volume  of  search  \nqueries  in  the  Google  search  engine  for  the  term  “misophonia”  relates  to  the  total  \nvolume  of  corresponding  Google  searches,  so  that  the  popularity  of  the  search  \nquery  can  be  seen  over  time .  Public  interest  in  \"misophonia\"  was  therefore  very  \nsubdued  until  the  middle  of  2011,  but  then  rose  sharply  at  the  end  of  September  \n2011  -  and  has  remained  at  least  at  this  level  to  this  day  (see  Fig.  3) .C.
