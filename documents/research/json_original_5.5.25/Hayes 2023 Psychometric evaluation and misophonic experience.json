      "text": "Introduction   \nThe literature has increasingly reported an  inappropriate and disproportionate reaction to specific \neveryday sounds  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019) . The complex disorder, \ntermed misophonia, elicits intense physiological and emotional responses and is characterised  by a \nhighly decreased sound tolerance  (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001; Swedo et al., 2021) . The trigger \nstimuli  and the reactions experienced are widespread, varying by individual; frequently reported \norganic sounds i nclude eating, breathing, chewing and nasal sounds . However , non -organic sounds \n(such as machine humming and clock ticking) have also been reported (Erfanian et al., 2019; Ferrer -\nTorres &  Giménez -Llort, 2022; Hansen et al., 2021; Jager et al., 2020; Larsen et al., 2022; Norris et al., \n2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, Erfanian, et al., 2021; Wu et al., \n2014) . Tigger so unds tend to be pattern -based and repetitive  (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., \n2017; Norris et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, Erfanian, et al., 2021) , and reactions can \nbe influenced by the context and the particular meaning that sound has to the individual  (Siepsiak et \nal., 2023; Swedo et al., 2022) . Emotional reactions include anger, disgust (Edelstein et al., 2013; Jager \net al., 2020; Kumar et al. , 2017; Schröder et al., 2013) , or anxiety and panic  (Remmert et al., 2022; \nRouw & Erfanian, 2018; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al. , 2023) . Some studies reported irritation as a primary  \nresponse  (Jager et al., 2020) , while others found a negative association between misophonia severity \nand an irritation response to triggers  (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, \nUglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021) . Misophonia causes significant impairment in daily social and \noccupational functioning  (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018; Swedo et al., 2022; Williams et al., 2022) . \n  \nThe development of measurement tools for assessing the severity of misophonia symptoms has been \nof large volume within the literature  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort,  2022) , there remain  limitations \nto such developed tools  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019) . For instance, \nscale development has often occurred  within non -representative samples and often fails to capture \nthe complexities of misophonia in this advancing field  (Potgieter et al., 2019) . Researchers in the area \nrecognise  the need for both screening and diagnostic tools that are psychometrically validated and \nadapted to all populations, including scale translation , to allow for cross -cultural understanding and \ncomparisons.   \n  \nThe Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale  (Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik -\nMarucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021)  is a 25 -item scale for assessing misophonia symptom severity. A \nfive-factor structure measu res internalising  appraisals (perception of oneself as a wrong  or angry \nperson for reacting to sounds), externalising  appraisals (propensity to blame others for making the \nsound), emotional threat (sense of being trapped or helpless if unable to escape fro m sounds), \noutbursts (fear of or displays of aggressive outburst), and impact (current and future limitations in life \nfrom misophonia). The S -Five is supplemented by a trigger checklist (S -Five-T), which measures the \nnature of the emotional reaction (such as anger or disgust) to trigger sounds and the intensity of those \nreactions.   \n  \nThe initial psychometric evaluation was completed with a sample of individuals self -identifying as \nhaving the condition  (Vitorat ou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021) . The five -factor structure, \nvalidity and reliability have since been replicated in a UK general population sample  (Vitoratou, Hayes,"

One study in a Portuguese sampl e (Cruz & \nAssunção, 2019) , in which a structured c linical interview was conducted, reported clinically significant \nmisophonia in 25% of participants . However, the study was limited by a small sample size of 44 \nparticipants, and the clinical interview was based on numerous unvalidated misophonia scales. \nTherefore, to gain an accurate understanding of misophonia in a Portuguese -speaking  population, \nthere is a clear need for a psychometrically valid scale to be translated and evaluated in a large sample.  \n  \nThis study aimed  to validate the S -Five in European Portuguese. For this purpose, we assessed the \nscale's dimensionality , reliability (test -retest and internal consistency) , and measurement validity  \nwithin a Portuguese -speaking  sample. In line with previous research, potential bias due to gender and \nage was  also explored, as well as the association between misophonia and symptoms of depression \nand anxiety."

      "text": "Methods  \nRecruitment  \nParticipants were sampled through social media groups, mailing lists, adverts  1(including an article \nabout misophonia in a Portuguese online newspaper called  P3 - Público) and contacts, and this type \nof convenience sampling allowed for sampling to be carried out quickly and at a low cost.  \nThe consent of participants was collected before  the completion of survey measures , with  the provision of a n \ninformation sheet ( ethics approval reference LRM-22/23-11826 ). The i nclusion criteria set for participation in \nthe study were being at lea st 18 years old  and fluent in Portuguese. The exclusion of those diagnosed with a \nsevere learning or intellectual disability , to the extent  that participating in a self -report survey was impossible , \nwas set as a criterion .  \nMeasures  \nDemographic information from participants was collected , including age, gender, ethnicity, education \nlevel, occupation , country of birth  and country  of residence. The survey asked respondents to report \nthe formal diagnoses of mental health conditions (including disorders relating to mood, anxiety, \ntrauma, psyc hosis, personality, eating and substance abuse), audiological conditions ( such as  tinnitus) \nand neurodevelopmental conditions , whether they knew the term misophonia and if they identified \nwith misophonia. Several self -report questionnaires were includ ed, as described below.  \nSelective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale  (S-Five; Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021)  \nThe S -Five consists of two parts. The first is the  S-Five scale , a 25 -item scale which measures the \nexperience of misophonia (severity scale) . The items are each rated on a n 11-point interval  scale from \n0, \"not at all true \", to 11 , \"completely true \". Previous validations  (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, \nHayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou et al., 2022)  of the S -Five have identified a five -factor . The five factors  \ncapture aspects of externalising  appraisals (for example,' people should not make certain sounds, even \nif they do not know about others'  sensitivities '), internalising  appraisals (for example , 'the way I react \nto certain noises makes me feel like I must be an unlikeable  person deep down '), threat  ('I feel trapped \nif I cannot get away from certain noises '), outburst  ('some sounds are so unbearable that I will shout \nat pe ople to make them stop ') and impact  ('my job opportunities are limited because of my reaction \nto certain sounds ') of the  disorder . The statements did not appear on the survey in any particular \norder.  \nThe second part is  the S-Five Trigger checklist (S -Five-T) which measures the frequency and intensity \nof a person's  reactions to trigger sounds . This study used the 37 trigger sounds from the or iginal \nresearch  (Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021) . For each trigger sound , a person \nresponds to two questions  relating to the past two weeks. F irst, a person  selects the most prominent \nreaction they experience to the trigger, with the options of no feeling, irritation, distress, disgust, \nanger, panic, other feeling: negative, and other feeling: positive. Second, a person rates the intensity \nof their reaction  from 0: do esn’t bother me  at all to 10: unbearable/causes suffering.   \nThe triggers checklist can be scored to provide four indices: 1) trigger count (TC), which is the total \nnumber of triggers endorsed by a person, 2) reaction count (RC), the to tal number of times a person \nselected  each of the possible reactions, 3) frequency/intensity of reactions score (FIRS) , the sum of \nintensity scores for endorsed triggers, 4) relative intensity of reactions score (RIRS), an estimation of \nreaction intensity, relative to the number of endorsed t rigger sounds.   \n \n1 Social media groups sampled – Facebook (Misofonia Sindrome, transtorno obsessivo compulsivo), reddit, \nposted on twitter"

      "text": "Translation procedure  \nThe S -Five was first translated independently from English to Portuguese  by two authors, RA and MC , \nfluent in Portuguese and English. These two translations were compared to create an agreed -upon \ntranslation of the s cale. This version was then back -translated to English by JC, fluent in  Portuguese \nand English , and compared to the original S -Five to ensure the items were consistent. The A -MISO -S \nand MQ were also translated in this way . Please contact the corresponding author for these scales.  \nThe original S -Five in English and the European Portuguese translation of the S -Five are presented in \nthe Appendix  (A1). \nOther measures  \nSeveral  further measures were implemented in the sample to aid in the validation process of the  \nEuropean Portuguese  translation of the S -Five.  \nTwo misophonia scales were administered to assess  the (concurrent ) convergent validity of the S -Five. \nThe A -MISO -S (Schröder et al., 2013) , a 6-item scale measure assessing the severity of one's  \nmisophonia  on a five -point ordinal scale (0 -4), and the MQ (Wu et al., 2014) , consisting of two \nsubscales , rated on a five -point ordinal scale , with 19-items measuring sensitivity to sounds  (MSYS)  \nand emotional and behavioural responses to sounds  (MEBS) , and a  single item  interval scale , rating  \nfrom 0 to 15 , to assess the severity of misophonia  (MSES) . \nThe 9 -item  Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9; Kroenke et al., 2001)  is a commonly used measure \nof depressio n, previously translated and validated in a Portuguese -speaking  population  (Monteiro et \nal., 2013) . Items are  rated on a 4-point ordinal scale with scores ranging from 0 to 27. Higher scores \nare indicative of greater  depression sym ptoms .  The 7 -item Generalise d Anxiety  Disorder -7 (GAD -7; \nSpitzer et al., 2006)  was used to measure anxiety symptoms. I tems are rated on a 4-point ordinal scale  \nwith a total score range of 0 –21, with higher scores indicati ng more anxiety symptoms.  The GAD -7 \nEuropean Portuguese translated version  used in this study was previously validated  by Sousa et al. \n(2015) . The 1 8-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index -3 (ASI-3; Ganho -Ávila et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2007)  is \na shorter version of the original Anxiety Sensitivity Index  (Peterson & Reiss, 1992) . The scale, rated on \na 5-point ordinal scale, measures fears about the possible consequences of anxiety sensations, \nincluding cognitive, physical , and social  concerns .  \nStatistical analysis  \nConfirm atory factor analysis was implemented to assess the accuracy of the previously defined latent \nstructure of the S-Five. The five -factor structure was compared to a unidimensional model. Due to the \nskewness of the data and the interval  response options , factor analysis for continuous data was \nimplement ed using  the maximum likelihood with robust standard errors  estimator  (MLR; Muthen & \nMuthén, 1998 -2017) .  \nIn factor analysis , a number of goodness of fit indices were considered in identifying the best fitting \nlatent variables model for the data . The guidelines  set out by the ConPsy checklist  (Vitoratou, Uglik -\nMarucha, et al., 2023)  for adequate and close fit were followed .  These indices and their criteria for \nclose fit were  the relative chi-square  (𝜒2) with  values less than 3  (Hoelter, 1983) , the Root Mean Square \nError of Approximation (RMSEA) with values <0 .05 (Hu & Bentler, 1999) , Standardised  Root Mean \nResidual (SRMR) with values <0.0 5 (Hooper et al., 2008)  and values >0.95 for both the Tucker -Lewis \nIndex  (TLI; Bentler & Bonett, 1980)  and the Comparative Fit Index  (CFI; Hu & Bentler, 1999) . For \nadequate fit to be concluded, we required  a relative  𝜒2 of le ss than five  (Hu & Bentler, 1999) , an RMSEA"

In collaborati on with a Portuguese team  experience d in the field \nof misophonia , the  25-item  S-Five was  accurately translate d into European Portuguese whilst ensuring \nthe psychometric integrity was maintained before distributing the survey to the Portuguese -speaking \npopulation. Factor analysis  of the scale  was carried out  to assess  the five-factor  model , and the \npsychometrics properties were evaluated . This study produce d novel findings that the S -Five scale is \nvalid for measuring misophonia  with in the Portuguese -speaking population.  \nThe five -factor solution of the S -Five scale, as shown in the original  study  (Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., \n2023; Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021)  as w ell as in translation studies  (Remmert \net al., 2022; Vitoratou et al., 2022) , was replicated in th e Portuguese sample . The factors measure \ninternalising  appraisals, externalising  appraisals , perceived threats, outbursts a nd impacts on daily \nfunctioning. The S -Five was developed to measure these aspects of misophonia cross -culturally , and \nthe pres ent study has shown that the S -Five is reliable within a Portuguese -speaking sample, evidence \nthat the scale can be used to assess the severity of misophonia within this population. This allows for \nthe direct comparison of scores across the different cultures of which the S -Five has been evaluated  \n(Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, \n2021; Vitoratou et al., 2022) . In previous validations of the S -Five, the scale has been determined to \nbe measurement invariant  with regard to age and gender. While some items are non-invariant for \ngender, these effects have been of a small magnitude and , as such , considered negligible. Within the \nPortuguese -speaking  sample, only one item from the outburst factor (I23 ‘Shout at people’) had a \nmedium non -invariant effect , all other items had small negligible effects. This  was further evidence \nthat the S -Five is measurement invariant, allowing for scores to be  compared across ages and genders."

      "text": "The externalising factor had the highest average score of the five factors , and the impact factor had \nthe lowest average score. This pattern was also seen in other cross -cultural studies which have used \nthe S -Five to evaluate mis ophonia  (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, \nUglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2022) . However, average threat scores were \narguably higher within the Portuguese -speaking sample when compared to the UK general population  \n(Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023)  and the translation studies of the S -Five scale  (Vitoratou et al., 2022) . \nThe UK misophonia population  (Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021)  was also found to \nhave the highest average scores in the threat factor  and the presence of a significant gender difference \nin threat scores . This could be explained by the higher percentage  of participants self -identifying as \nhaving misophonia in this sample when compared to the previous validations of the S -Five (Vitoratou, \nHayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou et al., 2022) , highlighting that those taking part in this st udy may not be \nrepresentative of the general Portuguese -speaking population.  \nThe S -Five factors had strong  positive correlations with the MQ and A -MISO -S, in agreement  with \nprevious findings  (Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik -Marucha, Hayes, & Gregory, 2021; \nVitoratou et al., 2022) . This further  establishes  that the S -Five has concurrent, convergent validity in \nassessing misophonia severity  within the Portuguese -speaking  sample . Similarly,  as found previously, \nmoderate correlations between the S-Five and the PHQ -9 and GAD -7 emerged . However, these \ncorrelations are likely due to the multidimensional nature of the S -Five, in comparison  to alternative \nmisophonia scales, as described in the literature  (Potgieter et al., 2019; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023)  \nand the findings of an association between the symptoms of the three disorders (Erfanian et al., 2019; \nNorris et al., 2022; Quek et al., 2018; Siepsiak et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2017) . While misoph onia severity \nwas moderately associated with anxiety symptoms , it was only weakly associated with anxiety \nsensitivity. Some studies have reported on the potential role of anxiety sensitivity in misophonia \n(Cusack et al., 2018; Dixon et al., 2023) . However,  Wang et al. (2022)  proposed  that this relationship \ncould be explained by a shared overlap in anxiety symptoms  rather th an a unique contribution of"

More research is needed to investigate further  the role of anxiety symptoms and \nsensitivity  in misophonia.  \nThis validation of the S -Five within the Portuguese -speaking  population allow s further investigations \ninto misophonia , such as its prevalence, severity and symptomology. The tool is also vital  for both  \nclinical a nd research utility, as the scale will allow for changes in misophonia to be reliably measure d \nin respon se to treatments and interventions  as these are developed and evaluated. The \nmultidimensional structure and the flexible trigger checklist  will allow for a more in-depth  \nunderstanding of misophonia and the correlates of misophonia with other disorders a nd symptoms \nwithin this population.  \nThere are several limitations of the present study that should not be overlooked. The main limitation \nis the exploratory nature of this study, which has used a mixed conv enience sample that limits the \nability  of generalisation  to the target population.  This restricts the application of the findings in \nestablishing  a cut -off score for clinically significant misophonia and cultural norms of misophonia. \nUnlike previous studies, the current study does not specify  the longevity of the S -Five in assessing  \nmisophonia severity . Thus  test-retest analysis would strengthen the scale's reliability . Further, as the \nprevious literature highlights, developing and implementing  a structured clinical interview alongside \nthe S -Five and other self -report measures would allow for discriminative validity of the S -Five to be \nestablished , this would  ensure the measurement of misophonia in isolation from co -morbid \nconditions.  \nIn conclusion, this study found that the five-factor structure of the S -Five was replicate d in a \nPortuguese -speaking  population, with proportionate evidence of reliability and validity . These findings  \nhighlight the robust nature of the existing S -five scale as a tool for measuring misophonia. Whi le \nfurther evidence is needed to demonstrate the generalisability of the results  to the general \nPortuguese population, this study provides preliminary findings that the S -Five can be administered in \nsuch a population for future research."
