An obstacle for research and clinical \npractice is that no comprehensively evaluated measures for pediatric misophonia ex ist. \nMethods:  In a sample of 102 youth meeting the proposed diagnostic criteria of misophonia, \nwe evaluated the child and parent -proxy versions of the self -reported Misophonia Assessment \nQuestionnaire (MAQ; assessing broad aspects of misophonia) and the ch ild version of the \nAmsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -MISO -S; assessing misophonia severity). Confirmatory and \nexploratory factor analysis were used to examine  factor structures of the measures. Further, \nchild -parent agreement on the MAQ and associations betwee n MAQ/A -MISO -S and \nimpairment, quality of life, and misophonia -related school interference were examined to \nevaluate aspects of convergent validity.  \nResults:  For both youth - and parent -ratings, four  MAQ  factors emerged: pessimism, distress, \ninterference, a nd non -recognition. A -MISO -S showed a unidimensional structure, but the item \n'effort to resist’ did not load significantly onto the unidimensional  factor. Good child -parent \nagreement on the MAQ scales were found and both MAQ and A -MISO -S were moderately to  \nstrongly associated with misophonia -related impairment and school interference, and \ninversely associated with quality of life.  \nLimitations: MAQ and A -MISO -S assess  sensitivity to auditory but not visual stimuli, the \nsample size was modest , and repeated as sessments were not conducted.  \nConclusions:  The combination of MAQ and A -MISO -S shows promise as a \nmultidimensional assessment  approach for pediatric misophonia.

      "text": "Running head: EVALUATION OF PEDIATRIC MISOPHONIA MEASURES  \n \n 3 Introduction  \n Misophonia is an increasingly recognized  condition characterized by intense emotional \nresponses to specific sounds or visual stimuli  (Swedo et al., 2022) . Common misophonia \ntriggers  include sounds generated by other people, especially eating  and breathing  sounds , and \nrepetitive mechanical sounds (e.g., tapping or clicking) . In misophonia, these sound s evoke \noverwhelming experiences of anger, irritation, or panic  (Guzick et al., 2023; Jager et al., \n2020) . (Guzick et al., 2023; Jager et al., 2020) . Misophonia is related to but distinct from \nother conditions characterized by sound intolerance , for example,  hyperacusis  and \nphonophobia. Hyperacusis is a condition where an individual experiences  marked physical \ndiscomfort  at sound  levels that are tolerable for most , while phonophobia refers to a persistent \nand unwarranted fear of specific sounds (Henry et al., 2022) . In contrast to these conditions, \nmisophonia is not primarily  a loudness tolerance problem , includes a broader rang e of triggers \nthan just sounds (e.g., associated visual triggers), a nd elicits  a wider range of emotional \nresponses  (often revolving around anger ) (Jager et al., 2020) . \n The etiology of misophonia is unknown and the re is no consensus about whether it is \nbest considered a n audiological, neurological, or psychiatric/psychological condition . \nClinically, a multidisciplinary approach  is recommended includ ing otolaryngologi cal, \naudiologi cal, and psychological elements , and treatable medical causes should be  ruled out ; \nhowever, there  are currently no agreemen t on specific  assessment protocols to use (Henry et \nal., 2022; Palumbo et al., 2018) . Misophonia  typically  begins during childhood  (Jager et al., \n2020; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Vitoratou et al., 2021)  and pediatric misophonia is \nassociated with significant psychiatric morbidity, functional impairment,  and poor well -being \n(Guzick et al., 2023; Rinaldi et al., 2022) . To date, there has been minimal validation of any \nmisophonia measures  for youth  (Rinaldi et al., 2022) . This is a n important limitation as Journal Pre-proof\nJournal Pre-proof"

Many  of these measures  were developed with multiple phases of validation including \nan initial large list of potential items with expert and stakeholder input and item \nreduction/retention decisions made through multiple rounds of item-response theory -based \ndecisions and factor analy tic approaches; this method was done with the DMQ  (Rosenthal et \nal., 2021) , the S -Five (Vitoratou et al., 2021) , the BMQ  (Remmert et al., 2022) , and the \nMisophonia Response Scale  (Dibb et al., 2021) . Others , including the SMS and the \nMisoQuest,  were conducted based on thorough literature review s and proposed diagnostic \ncriteria  (Rinaldi et al., 2022; Siepsiak et al., 2020) .  \n To our knowledge , only one  misophonia  measure has been evaluated  in youth . A \nminimally adapted version of the SMS for adolescents (SMS -A) show ed preliminary \nconvergent and discriminant validity in a random sample of 10-14 year -olds (n = 142)  and \ncorrelated moderately and significantly with measures of obsessive -compulsive symptoms , \nanxiety, and inversely with wellbeing, and did not show a significant correlation with creative \nself-concept  (Rinaldi et al., 2021) . \n Because this scale has only recently been validated and  has not been tested  in clinical \nsamples or with a wide r age range, existing case studies and series of youth have relied on \nother, unvalidated measures.

A-MISO -S includes six items which , in line with Y -BOCS,  assesses \ntime captured by symptoms, distress, interference, effort to resist  symptoms , control over \nsymptoms, and avoidance. In the  only one study that has evaluated the A -MISO -S in a \nyounger age group, Naylor et al. (2021)  found, in a sample of 336 undergraduate student (18 -\n24 years),  that the measure  had a unidimensional factor structure, explain ing 45% of the \nvariance in item responses , and adequate internal consistency, α = .81.  \n Another popular measure in case studies of youth with misophonia is the Misophonia \nAssessment Questionnaire  (MAQ) . This measure  was developed by clinician s and  assess es \nseveral aspects of misophonia -related experiences and functioning  (Johnson and Dozier, \nhttps://misophoniatreatment.com/wp -content/uploads/2016/02/Binder_all_forms.pdf) . Items \non the MAQ address how misophonia might affect emotional functioning (e.g., “My sound \nissues have recently made me feel angry,” “My sound issues currently make me unhappy”), \nsocial functioning (“My sound issues currently make me feel isolated,” “My sound issues \nhave recently affected my ability to be with other people”), as well as beliefs about the origin \nand prognosis of having sound sensitivity (e.g., “My sound issues do not seem to have a \nknown cause,” “I feel that my sound issues will only get worse with time”). Although this \nmeasure has been used to draw preliminary conclusions about treatment outcomes in youth \nwith misophonia  via case series  (Dozier, 2015; Lewin et al., 2021) , psychometric validations \nhave not been pursued.  \n Considering the lack of validated measures for misophonia in youth , the primary aim of \nthis study is to psychometrically evaluate  child - and parent -report ed versions of the MAQ  and \na child -reported version of  A-MISO -S.

First, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test whether each of the measures \ncould be considered to have a unidimensional factor structure. A unidimensional factor \nstructure indicates that  all items load  onto a single latent factor , in this case, a factor \nrepresenting overall misophonia severity . The CFAs were conducted using the R library \nlavaan (Rosseel, 2012) . The items of all scales were ordinal and therefore the diagonally \nweighted leas t squares estimator was used . This estimator  model s non-normal responses as \nindicators of a normally distributed latent factor s. Model/data fit was evaluated by inspecting \nfour fit indices: Comparative  Fit Index (CFI), Tucker -Lewis Index (TLI), Root Mean Square \nError of Approximation (RMSEA) , and Standardized Mean Square Residual (SRMR). An \nRMSEA below 0.06, an SRMR below 0.08 and CFI and TLI estimates greater than 0.90 are \nindicative of acceptable model -data fit; CFI and TLI estimates above 0.95 are indicative of \ngood model -data fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999) . We estimated scaled fit indices because of the \nordinal nature of the data.  Internal consistencies  were estimated as part of the CFAs  and \nCronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega coefficients were used to examine internal \nconsistency.

While an increased focus on misophonia and its consequences is important , research \nwith children and adolescents  has lagged, which is unfortunate as the condition typically  \nbegins  during childhood. A cornerstone in advanc ing the understanding of pediatric \nmisophonia is adequate measurement of symptoms and their impact  on everyday life and \nmental and social health. With the aim to inform research and support the assessme nt of \nmisophonia in regular practice, we conducted a psychometric  evaluation of two misophonia \nmeasures  that have been used with youth but never evaluated : MAQ and A -MISO -S.  \n MAQ assesses  negative effects of misophonia in everyday life  as well as thoughts  about  \nthe origin s and prognosis  of the sound difficulties . Our findings showed that the MAQ is best \nconsidered a multidimensional measure , with f our identical scales emerg ing for the child and \nparent versions : pessimism, non-recognition, interference, and current distress.  The four \nscales correlated in the moderate range  with each other , indicating that they are related but \nstill distinct constructs. These findings provide the field with a four-dimensional model of \nmisopho nia that can be used to aid  future research.  A possible future route is to examine \nwhether difficulties in certain dimensions are more important to course and treatment \nresponse.

For example, the item that assesses current impact \non family life loaded onto current distress for parents and interference for children.  This \nindicates that some  MAQ  items take on slightly different meanings for children and parents. \nWhen examining child -parent agreement, it was clear that the different MAQ subscales \ncorrelated most strongly with the corresponding child/parent scale, providing evidence for \nconvergent validity of the MAQ subscales  outlined here . Although somewhat distinct, t he \nfour s ubscales correlated moderately to strongly with  each other and there were  only small \ndifferences in the size of these correlations. This suggests that the four scales can be \nconsidered indicators of a broad misophonia co nstruct, which is well captured by the total \nMAQ score. Accordingly, t he total score showed good convergent validity in relation to \nclinician -rated misophonia impairment, child -rated quality of life , and parent -rated school \ninterference  stemmin g from misophonia , as well as sound internal consistency . We \nrecommend future researchers to employ both the  MAQ  subscales and the  MAQ  total score in \nresearch on pediatric misophonia.  However, it is important to evaluate whether the 4 -factor \nstructure prese nted here replicates in other youth samples.  \n The A -MISO -S is intended as a measure of overall misophonia severity and is based on \na well -validated measure of OCD  (Y-BOCS)  (Goodman et al., 1989) . The A -MISO -S \nassesses  time, distress, interference, control, resistance, and avoidance. Our results support \nthat a child -rated version of  A-MISO -S shows promise as  a unidimensional measure  of \noverall severity of pediatric  misophonia . Importantly, the measure was significantly \nassociated with several other misophonia measures and with interview -rated misophonia \nimpairment  and school interference  and i nversely associated with quality of life . \nUnexpectedly, we found that item 4  (How much effort do you make to resist the [thoughts \nabout the] misophonic triggers? ) did not contribute with unique variance to the overall Journal Pre-proof\nJournal Pre-proof"

When we examined i tem variance  (not reported), we found that variance \non this item was similar to  the other A -MISO -S items.  Thus, low variance could not explain \nthe above result.  It is worth noting that psychometric research on the Y-BOCS , upon which \nthe A -MISO -S was based, has also found that the “resistance to obsessions”  item has a subpar \ncontribution to the full measure  (Storch et al., 2010) . This pattern appears to be  even more \npronounced when the item is  applied to pediatric misophonia, and it may be  that resistance to \nsymptoms has more relevance to OCD than to misophonia.  Further, w hen administering this \nitem, it is likely that individuals have difficulty understanding what is meant by “resisting \nthoughts about misophonic triggers,” when a typical emotional response  is often described as \nautomatic and immediate  rather than associated  with very clearly identifiable cognitions.  \nParticularly for younger children, it may be difficult t o even conceptualize how they may \nresist thoughts about misophonic triggers . Further, in the present  study,  many participants had \ndifficulties distinguishin g this item  from item five (how much control do you have over your \nthoughts about the sounds). We urge researchers using the A -MISO -S to carefully examine \nwhether this and other items are useful indicators of overall misophonia severity  and to \ncontinue to pursue developmentally sensitive adaptations of misophonia scales . \n Strengths of this study include child and parent ratings from a well-defined and \nreasonably large sample of youth with interview -confirmed misophonia , but several \nlimitations merit mentioning. First, although all participants were carefully assessed using the \nproposed criteria for misophonia, we did not conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation including \nassessment s by an otolaryngologist and an audiologist , making it h ard to completely rule out \nmedical causes for the misophonia symptoms  in each participant . Future studies should \nsystematically examine whether and to what degree misophonia symptoms in children and \nadolescents can be explained by treatable medical causes.
