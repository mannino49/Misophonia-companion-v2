      "text": "19 \nID:2- Reciprocal mentoring in UK Higher Education – a case from a UK \nBusiness School  \nMs. Ann - Aaron Taylor   \n \nABSTRACT  \nReciprocal mentoring in UK Higher Education (HE) is a relatively recent concept that is growing in \nsignificance as its benefits are becoming more clearly understood (Burdett, 2014). The process \nprovides a platform for students to deliver their own unique f eedback and for universities to gain an \ninsight into student mind -sets and experiences so that they can better respond to needs and \nrequirements.  \n \nIn this study, reciprocal mentoring was piloted with a new PhD student and an experienced doctoral \nsupervisor in order to uncover ways in which to enhance the quality of doctoral supervision in a UK \nBusiness School. In addition to the monthly PhD superviso ry meeting, a further meeting was \norganised each month to develop a wider perspective on how to improve the current level of \nprovision. The dates and times of these meetings were agreed between the mentor and mentee.  \n \nThe empirical data confirmed the view that reciprocal mentoring plays a significant role in enhancing \nstudent engagement and provides a transformational impact on the student “voice”.  \nNew discoveries indicate that there were several tangible benefits to reciprocal mentoring.

As H R and coaches all welcome this \nopportunity, do we also embrace potential differences when it comes to our online presence, \nparticularly coaching presence? Why coaching presence? Coaching presence is understood to be the \nmost important mastery skill when it  comes to effective and transformational communication. Do we \nnotice the implications of moving from offline to online coaching when it comes to this particular skill, \none which has been understood to be our most important lever of mastery?  \nIn this workshop, we will focus on getting a felt sense of at least one big difference in 1:1 online \ncoaching presence and at least one big difference in team coaching presence - all based on scientific \nwork I am conducting, and experiential wisdom support ed by client feedback.  \n \nFact and figures based on most recent research:  \n• Structural interviews with 76 coaches on coaching presence: 91% reported great initial \nrapport, no difference between online and offline presence  \n• Structural interviews with 100 companies / 50 -250 employees / 6 months: 87% reported \ncoachees’ drop -out; coachees only partly engaged, not engaged at all in virtual coaching  \n• Digital coaching platforms: report 250% ROI for well -being (CoachHub, 2020)  \n \nRecent article in Handbook of Digital Coaching (Routledge, in print) edited by Passmore, J. et al.  \n \n  \nKeywords:  virtual coaching, coaching presence, online presence, offline presence, individual \ncoaching, team coaching"

For instance, they are \nexpected to adhere to familial and societal standards when choosing a career. Furthermore, Indian \nparents consider jobs in STEM more prestigious and thus of ten pressure their children to acquire \nemployment in science and technology -related fields, such as the IT industry. How these individuals \novercome external influences projected by family and friends is largely unknown. Once individuals \nare put in the orga nizational system, they must overcome these influences to achieve career success.  \nThe Western conceptualizations of career success that ignore cultural nuances lead to a one -sided \nunderstanding of career success in a globalized market. Thus, this study examined the underexplored \nconcept of career success in a collectivist culture such a s India, which lends limited agency over career \ndecisions to its youth.  \n \nThis paper explores the career success perceptions of Generation Z (born between 1995 and 2012), \nthe youngest generation working in India’s information technology (IT) industry. Using a constructivist \ngrounded theory design, we interviewed sixteen particip ants to understand how they perceive their \ncareer success. The analysis indicates that the participants gained agency over their careers by \niteratively developing self -awareness, self -efficacy, and career self -efficacy, ultimately leading them \nto develop a  self-concept. By developing self -concept, participants gradually moved away from their \ncollectivist influences and actively participated in their career advancement. The findings of this study \nfurther indicate that the participants’ engagement with their careers helped them gain agency over \ntheir careers by making independent decisions attributed to their perceptions of career success.  \nWe borrow from the career self -construal concept to understand how individuals from a collectivist \nculture perceive career success. Cultural construal is a social understanding of how individuals from \ndifferent cultures perceive themselves and how others i nfluence their cognition about self (Markus & \nKitayama, 1991).  \n \nThe findings from this study have implications for organizations in designing programs that effectively \nattract, engage, and retain Generation Z employees.  \n \nKeywords:  Gen Z, Information technology, grounded theory, career agency, cultural construals"

Phishing emails can vary in the \namount of people targeted, sophistication, and purpose (Fruhlinger, 2022). It is a ubiquitous \nproblem in modern day society and organizations, which in the year 2017 alone caused an \nestimated $1,400,000,000 USD in damages (Pienta et al, 2020). This trend is not like ly to slow down \nas currently more than 5,000,000,000 people are online (Statista, 2023). Indeed, phishing is a major \nissue as cyber -attacks are among the top 10 threats to global stability and phishing is certainly an \nintegral part of cyber -attacks (Ge et al, 2021). Phishing has arguably influenced the geo -political \nlandscape of the world already with Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager being phished and thus \ninfluencing the 2016 United States elections (Rashid, 2020). There also is no technological elixir t o \ncure the phishing plague within the foreseeable future (Alsharnouby et al, 2015). This is largely due \nto phishing attacks targeting humans, as they are often the weakest link in cyber defense. Phishing \nattacks at their core use psychological tricks into cajoling or luring a victim into doing the attackers \nintended purpose (Pienta et al, 2020).  \n \nThe Big Five psychological factors model is has been shown to largely explain how someone \nbehaves (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Goldberg, 1990). The Big Five trait of conscientiousness has been \nshown to be an indicator of job performance for over 100 years (Wilm ont & Ones, 2019). Yet the \nresults of the Big Five factors’ interface with phishing response is not clear as of yet. There are \ndozens of peer -reviewed academic studies currently which have examined this topic. However, they \noften have contradictory results  thus leaving no clear consensus on this topic (Sommestad & \nKarlzen, 2019). While the relationship in regard to phishing response is currently ambiguous, it \nappears that some traits may have a significant influence on that response. Thus far there is no \ntheoretical model which takes all of these details into account.  \nThe purpose of this study was to elucidate the interactions between phishing and the Big Five \nfactors. The research questions to be answered by were as follows:  \n \nRQ1: What does the existing evidence show as the relationship between the Big Five factor traits \nand phishing response?  \nRQ2: In what ways, if any, do the existing studies show that there is a specific victim phishing \npersonality profile? Ge et al (2021) suggested that there is a victim personality.  \n \nThe present research will examine that possibility.  \nThis study used an integrative literature review method (Toracco, 2005) to examine the relationship \nbetween the Big Five psychological factors and the phishing response. The search process for this \nliterature review was a multi -faceted one. There were seve ral databases used in this process. The \nfirst search used was a general search in Purdue’s Library for Phishing AND Big Five Personality in \nPeer Reviewed Academic Journals. The same search was used in Google Scholar, Gale OneFile’s \ndatabase, and ProQuest. This process was then repeated by searching Phishing AND Psychology. \nThe search was not limited by date, but only English texts were used.  \n \nThe study will develop a theoretical model of the resulting relationships. This theoretical model can \nthen be used to suggest practical implications in terms of human resource development (HRD) \ninterventions within organizations. Such interventions can aid  both the organizations and their"

Based on these \nassumptions, this study focuses the current role and impact of coaching on human resources \nperformance, specifically the processes in personal and professional development. Coaching is a \nprocess that has been little studied empirically in relation to organizational phe nomena such as \nemotions, teamwork and conflict management. With this in mind, this research also aimed to \nunderstand what contribution this process makes to interpersonal relationships. The research \nquestion guiding this study is: \"Is coaching a determinin g factor in a company for personal and \nprofessional development, contributing to better performance and consequently greater employee \nproductivity?\". Methodologically, this is based on a qualitative nature, based on interviews with \ncoachees. For this purpo se, an interview guide was constructed, using the snowball sampling \ntechnique, and 14 coachees were interviewed. The participants are aged between 30 and 54 years \nold (13 women and 1 man), with different areas of professional activity. After analyzing the \nrespondents' responses, the information was categorized. We managed to get the perception that \nwith the coaching sessions, the coachees surveyed consider that they developed different skills with \nthis process, such as license, self -confidence, strategic vi sion, among others, and also that this \nprocess brought them benefits as professionals, such as empathy with the other, self -confidence \nand focus on meeting objectives. As expected, finding a consensual definition of Coaching was not \npossible in the data an alysis, this strengthens the concept of Ives (2008) when he mentions that the \ndefinition of the concept today still creates controversy. However, most of the time, Coaching is \nassociated with personal development, to achieve goals and a helping relationshi p. To sum up, it \ncan be inferred that coaching provides various benefits, develops soft skills and improves the \nperformance of human resources in business and organizational environments. Regarding to \nlimitations, this study had a small sample size, which meant that the results could not be \ngeneralized on a large scale. For future studies, it would be interesting to carry out a study that \nwould make it possible to compare the coachees' competences before and after going through the \ncoaching process, with th e aim of analyzing which competences were acquired, as well as their \nimpact on performance.  \n \nKeywords:  Coaching; personal and professional development, performance; human resources."

      "text": "26 \nID:41 - Navigating doing good: pro bono coaching promises and pitfalls  \nJudie G annon , Ksenia Warren & Loanna Lordanou  \nABSTRACT  \n \nThis paper presents primary evidence from a study on pro bono coaching. It draws on professional \nservices theory (von Nordenflycht, Malhorta & Morris, 2015; von Nordenflycht, 2010) to examine \nwhy coaches are drawn to providing pro bono coaching services. L iterature on pro bono \nprofessional services offer contradictory evidence on the benefits of pro bono professional work. \nWhile most professions and professionals have connotations with status, privilege and various \nforms of capital, this is in direct refuta tion with under -represented and disadvantaged groups and \ncommunities in society. However, third sector organisations, and under -served and disadvantaged \nservice users, are seen to gain from the provision of pro bono work. There is also data which \nsuggests it can undermine their trust in professions and professionals. Likewise, while service \nproviders (professionals themselves) may enhance their own professional development and \nexperience through pro bono work, studies have also suggested that such services can lead to \nprofessionals suffering from embarrassment and feelings of inferiority (Ong & Yang, 2014; \nPatterson et al., 2021). Organisational and institutional perspectives indicate that while pro bono \nprofessional services can generate future new revenue lines, enhance professions’ societal \nstanding, and prosociality amongst professionals (Ryan, 2021), damage can accrue where such \nservices are undervalued. As such significant tensions are evident across different stakeholders \n(professionals and their assoc iations, third sector organisations, professional service firms, policy \nmakers and underserved and disadvantaged communities).     \n \nCoaching can be understood as a valuable HRD practice with a deep commitment to supporting the \nrealisation of human potential, within organisations but also more broadly as part of living a \nmeaningful life (Shoukry & Cox, 2018; Western, 2017).  Drawing on interviews and image elicitation \nwith coaches, educators, supervisors, and third sector clients, this paper highlights how the \ndevelopment of coaches, and coaching as a profession, exacerbates and extends our current \nunderstanding of why professionals enga ge in pro bono work. While personal development may \ninitially be at the root of pro bono coaching work, more complex aspects of altruism and being \ninherently a human -values driven endeavour are also evident in respondents’ accounts. Concerns \nabout addressi ng the imbalance of access to the benefits of coaching are also evident amongst \nrespondents alongside the frictions of managing completely free, low fee and commercial rates of \ncoaching provision. The paper concludes by identifying implications for profess ional services theory \nin specific professional contexts, and specific practice implications for coaches and HRD \nprofessionals as part of their wider commitment to supporting and realising human potential, \nwithin organisations and across communities and soc iety more widely.  \n \nReferences  \n \nOng, David and Yang, Chun -Lei, Pro Bono Work and Trust in Expert Fields (July 26, 2014).

This may stem from the fact that, during the \ncourse of work, we unconsciously adjust or modify many internal feelings or perceptions. These \nfeelings are likely associated with interactions with colleagues, supervisors, clients, involving the \nextraction of emotional communication. Literature indicates that long -term care attendants must \nconceal or suppress genuine emotions, u sing more love and patience to care for individuals with \nphysical and mental disabilities. Simultaneously, this process may lead to work fatigue, \nsubsequently leading to work avoidance and interpersonal detachment (Wang et al., 2023). \nTherefore, drawing fr om research in other work domains, when facing negative mentor expertise \nfrom superiors, exploring the impact of emotional labor on the job embeddedness of mid -ranking \nofficers can be crucial.  \n \nRetaining and utilizing talented individuals has become a challenging Human Resource \nDevelopment (HRD) issue for Taiwan military (Wang, 2023). For instance, enhancing the willingness \nof mid -ranking military officers to continue their service has been an on going goal. Previous studies \non the factors influencing the retention intentions of military officers including the pension reform \nsystem (Liu, 2019), life satisfaction (Wu & Yang, 2020), organizational socialization level (Liu & Chen, \n2018), and job satis faction (Li, 2019).  \nHowever, when mid -ranking military officers face their decision of whether to resign, what truly \ndiscourages them from continuing their service is often not the existing system and policies. \nInstead, it is about the factors within the workplace environment , such as interactions with \ncoworkers, workloads, and tasks in the units and positions. Some studies suggested that negative \nmentoring experiences in the mentoring program when working with the military can be an issue \n(Eby et al., 2004).  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThis study investigated the impact of perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise on the mid -\nranking military officers’ motional labor behaviors and job embeddedness in Taiwan.  \n \nHypotheses  \nHypothesis 1: Perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise can decrease mid -ranking military \nofficers’ fit with their units.  \nHypothesis 2: Perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise can decrease mid -ranking military \nofficers’ sacrifice from their units.  \nHypothesis 3: Mid -ranking military officers’ surface acting plays a mediating role between  \ntheir perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and fit.  \nHypothesis 4: Mid -ranking military officers’ surface acting plays a mediating role between their  \nperceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and sacrifice.  \nHypothesis 5: Mid -ranking military officers’ deep acting plays a mediating role between  \ntheir perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and fit.  \nHypothesis 6: Mid -ranking military officers’ deep acting plays a mediating role between  \ntheir perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and sacrifice."

Even \nthough 400 online surveys were answered, the missing data sections, unavailable and wrong key -in \ndata were taken out. We ended up with a total of 290 questionnaires usable to conduct data \nanalysis. In the end, a total of 290 samples of online surveys were answered, giving a responding \nrate of 72.5%.  \n \nImplications for HRD practice  \nThe study indicates that supervisors’ lacking mentor expertise are deficient in professional \nknowledge within their field of expertise. This deficiency allows subordinates more decision -making \nspace and flexibility, giving them considerable influence over decisions, and empowers oneself with \na sense of accomplishment and enhances job satisfaction. When recognized themselves as \nindispensable members of the organization, they naturally fit much more with the unit. This makes \nthem less inclined to consider res ignation.  \n \nFor mid -ranking officers, surface acting exhibits a passive and almost resource -free action. For \ninstance, pretending to be know nothing allows them to avoid unnecessary responsibilities. \nMoreover, in the military work environment, the truth is that \"more work, more mistakes; less work, \nless mistakes; no work, no mistakes.\" Doing more works does not necessarily result in additional \npay, but providing more personal time and allowing punctual departure from work. Supervisors’ \nlack of mentor expertise are less  likely to interfere with subordinates, providing them with more \nfreedom. Responding to supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise with a passive and resource -free \nsurface acting and the performance appraisal system lacking of distinguishable ability may lead t o \nindividuals to fit much more with the unit and organization.  \n \nSignificance/contribution to the HRD field  \nLeaders who enhance their mentor expertise, empower their subordinates, and acknowledge the \nindispensable role of each individual within the organization tend to foster better fit, encouraging \nsubordinates to wholeheartedly commit to serving the organization.  \nWhile research results indicate that it can make mid -ranking military officers fit more seamlessly \nwith the unit and become less willing to sacrifice their military careers, it is still a negative impact on \nthe organization’s long -term development.

This reflects a shift towards personalized, adaptive career \ngrowth strategies in organizations (Gray et al., 2019). However, there's a notable gap in literature \nspecifically exploring the effectiveness of coaching within HRD (Carvalho et al., 2023), especially as \norganizations increasingly favor individualized career paths and flexible development strategies \n(Cidral et al., 2021).  \n \nOur paper addresses this gap by examining coaching's role and impact in HRD for career \ndevelopment. Coaching offers tailored solutions that align with both individual employee \naspirations and organizational strategic goals (Johnson et al., 2021), essential  for personal and \nbusiness success (Maamari et al., 2021). Despite its importance, this topic is underrepresented in \nexisting HRD literature (Burleigh et al., 2022). Our study aims to critically analyze current coaching \npractices in HRD, their adherence to  ICF standards, and their effectiveness in fostering significant \nand lasting career development (Ribeiro et al., 2020). We intend to significantly enhance \nunderstanding and implementation of coaching as a key element in HRD strategies, adapting to the \nneed s of the modern workforce and workplace.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nThis paper aims to deepen the understanding of coaching's influence on career development in \nHRD. Our specific objectives are:  \n1. To systematically review empirical studies focusing on coaching within the realm of HRD, \nparticularly in career development.  \n2. To conduct a thematic analysis to identify major themes and patterns in the application of \ncoaching for career development.  \n3. To pinpoint research gaps and propose avenues for future research and practice.  \n \nResearch Methods  \nTo address the research objectives of our study, we adopted the integrative review method. This \napproach is particularly useful for synthesizing research to create new frameworks and \nperspectives, especially in fields where the body of literature is vast a nd diverse (Evans & Pearson, \n2001; Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). We followed the five -stage review process outlined by Whittemore \nand Knafl (2005) to ensure methodological rigor.  \n \nStage 1: Problem Identification  \nIn the initial stage, we identified the problem, determined the review purpose, and specified the \nvariables of interest. The problem identified is the underexplored role of coaching in career \ndevelopment within the context of HRD. The review aims to synthesize existing literature on this \ntopic to illuminate the gap and unders tand the integration of coaching in HRD for career \ndevelopment.  \n \nStage 2: Literature Search  \nThe literature search involved a sequential process. We searched databases including Academic \nSearch Ultimate, Business Source Ultimate, and Emerald Insight, focusing on literature published"

We then applied filters \nto include only peer -reviewed, English -language journal articles,  which refined the results. Duplicate \nentries were removed, and articles were further screened by reviewing abstracts and \nmethodologies. This process led to the selection of relevant empirical studies for the review.  \n \nStage 3: Data Evaluation  \nWe evaluated the quality of the final selection of articles, coding them as high or low based on \nmethodological rigor and data relevance. All selected articles were assessed to ensure their \nthoroughness and relevance to our study on coaching in HRD and car eer development.  \n \nStage 4: Data Analysis  \nThe selected articles were analyzed to categorize their methods, subjects, contexts, and findings. \nThis analysis aimed to integrate the various aspects of coaching as it pertains to career \ndevelopment within HRD, identifying common themes, patterns, and ga ps in the literature.  \n \nStage 5: Data Presentation  \nThe integration of the characteristics of the selected articles will be presented in a structured \nmanner. This will include a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, data collection \ntechniques, subjects, and contexts of the research. The aim is to pro vide a clear and detailed \nsynthesis of the existing literature, highlighting how coaching is implemented in HRD for career \ndevelopment.  \n \nImplications for HRD Practice  \nThe outcomes of this review are of considerable importance for HRD practitioners and career \ndevelopment professionals. Our analysis provides a strategic roadmap for integrating coaching into \ncareer development strategies, tailored to align with both indivi dual career goals and the broader \nobjectives of the organization (Carrell et al., 2021). This balanced approach emphasizes the \ncustomization of coaching to individual needs while maintaining alignment with the overarching \ngoals of the organization.  \n \nKey findings suggest the need for HRD professionals to adopt a strategic approach in implementing \ncoaching. This involves aligning coaching practices not only with the specific goals and culture of the \norganization but also with the unique career aspiratio ns of each employee (Peters, 2023). Such a \ndual -focused approach ensures that coaching is an effective tool for personal career advancement \nas well as for advancing organizational talent management objectives. Moreover, our research \nhighlights the importan ce of developing a coaching culture within organizations as a critical aspect \nof HRD. This culture should foster continuous learning and adaptability, supporting proactive career \nmanagement (Sarsur & Parente, 2019). In establishing such a culture, coaching  becomes more than \nan intervention; it is an integral part of the organizational environment, contributing to a more \nengaged, agile, and prepared workforce. The implications emphasize the importance of \nimplementing coaching practices that are both individu al-centric and organizationally aligned. This \nstrategic alignment is key to fostering a skilled and adaptable workforce.  \n \nConclusion  \nOur comprehensive analysis uncovers the multifaceted role of coaching in career development \nwithin HRD contexts. The research underscores the potential of coaching to offer tailored support \nfor individual career paths, while also highlighting challenges such as aligning coaching outcomes \nwith organizational strategies and maintaining consistency in coaching  standards (Carvalho et al., \n2023). The paper concludes with a call for a strategic and thoughtful integration of coaching in HRD \npractices, recognizing both its potential benefits and limitations. We also identify a pressing need"

Trauma is not a \nnew phenomenon, but perhaps due to the impacts of two globally traumat izing events happening \nin such a short period, it is finally being given the attention it deserves. There are real -world \nimplications for traumas, especially when left unaddressed. Individuals and organizations suffer the \nconsequences of unmet needs due to  trauma. Individuals who have experienced trauma are likely \nto experience a wide range of negative consequences, some examples include; frustration, \ncynicism, anger, brain fog, forgetfulness, distractability, depression, detachment, irritability, and \nbeing  less organized (Fink -Samnick, 2022; Koloroutis & Pole, 2021). It is easy to see how the \nconsequences of trauma could influence how staff engage with their work and organizations. \nAlthough the impact of trauma on organizations has not been widely researche d, there is evidence \nthat organizations are impacted by trauma. Trauma experienced by staff can lead to increased \ntension in teams, negatively impact: turnover, organizational costs, quality, and safety, as well as \nblur professional boundaries in organizai tons (Koloroutis & Pole, 2021; Fink -Samnick, 2022). There \nare specific industries that are more likely to expose their staff to traumas in the line of performing \ntheir work duties; including military, healthcare, and other human services industries (Bowen,  et.al, \n2011; Manderscheid, 2009). Trauma -informed leadership is a relatively new concept that focuses on \nhow leaders and organizations can support staff during times of trauma.  \n \nPurpose/ Question/ Theoretical Base  \nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the impacts of trauma on organizations and the people that \nmake them up. The question driving this is; How can the field of HRD meet the growing need of \nworkers and organizations to address trauma?  \n \nImplications for Practice  \nStaff in organizations want trauma to be addressed by organizations (Boitet, et. al, 2023). First, staff \nwant organizations to mitigate panic (Manderscheid, 2009). This can relate to macro, or micro \ntraumas happening in the workplace, and macro traumas hap pening outside of the workplace. \nCommunication and preparation are both integral to organizations being able to do this effectively. \nAdditionally, staff want to feel heard, protected, seen, prepared, and have facilitated coping and \ngrowth (Koloroutis & Pol e, 2021). There is much that organizations can do to address these needs.  \n \nTo start, there should be a focus on creating training and development programs that build skills in \nemotional regulation, conflict resolution, restorative justice, and compassion, all of which can \ncontribute to addressing trauma more effectively (Ravitch,  2020). Furthermore, organizations can \nwork to support reflective practices, which are effective in addressing trauma; examples of this \ncould include collaborative reflective writing practice and listening and discovery sessions (Ravitch, \n2020). Lastly, pr actitioners can explore the ways that trauma impacts staff resistance to planned \nchange initiatives, and work on identifying specific interventions related to trauma, including \ncompassionate reactions to trauma responses.  \n \nConclusions  \nThis is a work in progress, however, preliminary research indicates that there are significant \nnegative impacts on individuals and organizations when trauma is left unaddressed, that staff want"

Surprisingly, despite their short organizational tenure, Gen Z has reported feeling \nburnt out and intention to leave their careers (Constantz, 2023). The recent Gallup poll suggests that \n54% of the Gen Z  employees are disengaged at work (Fernandez et al., 2023). They value work -life \nbalance, and consequently demand remote work options, flexible hours, excellent pay, reasonable \nworkloads, and seek interesting and purpose -driven work (Barhate & Dirani, 2021 ). Additionally, \nthey are forever looking for alternate career paths such as gig working, starting their own business, \nor freelancing because of their digital influence and entrepreneurial spirit. However, they have \nreported to experience workplace incivil ity due to their conflicting views with older generations \n(Power, 2023).  \n \nGenerational clashes due to differing points of view have remained the top cause of workplace \nincivility (Akella & Lewis, 2019). Younger workers are subjected to myriad unconscious biases and \nstereotyping because they are vocal about work -life integration and a zeal for meaningful and \npurpose -driven work. This may result in an increasing gap between leaders and their expectations \nas they lack a deeper understanding of the actual expectations of these young netizens. \nConsequently, there is an impending threa t of losing valuable employees, especially women, as data \nsuggests an unprecedented surge in resignations among women when they are denied their \nessential needs including opportunity, flexibility, and commitment to diversity and inclusion \n(Alsever, 2022). In fact, approximately 75% of women under 30 have expressed that flexibility and \nan organization’s dedication to well -being are paramount to their sustainability in the workplace \n(Alsever, 2022).  \n \nGen Z women are vocal about work -life integration and a zeal for meaningful and purpose -driven \nwork. Since they are also more aware of their organizational rights (Grow & Yang, 2018), theycall out \ndiscriminatory behavior confidently. Further, it is posited  that Gen Z women have traditional work \nand family values. Although ambitious, they want to prioritize their family’s well -being (Carufel, \n2021); and create wholesome relationships at work with peers and superiors (Barhate & Dirani, \n2021). Additionally, th ey are their own advocates and are not timid when negotiating and asking for \nmore from their work compared to Gen X and baby boomer females (Alsever, 2022). This newest \ngeneration of women in the workforce expects their superiors to take up the role of men tors \n(Barhate & Dirani, 2021). Thus, having a developmental relationship, such as reverse mentoring \n(RM), at the beginning of their career would provide them with the needed information and help \nthem integrate within the organizational culture (Tomaskovic -Devey & Orellana, 2022)  \n \nTheoretical Basis  \nThe quote at the beginning of this abstract captures the essence of our paper beautifully as we \nargue that Gen Z is the future of our workforce. Rather than alienating them from organizational \npractices, it is important to teach and learn from them. We ass ert that RM can be the anchor to \nachieve harmony and manage expectations among today’s multigenerational workforce. Reverse \nmentoring is defined as a non -traditional inverted form of mentoring relationship whereby the \nseasoned and more experienced employee s are paired as mentees with organizational novices as \nmentors, who are tasked with the opportunity to teach the senior mentees (Chaudhuri & Ghosh, \n2012; Murphy, 2012; Chaudhuri, 2019)."

He paired 500 executives, mostly at th e C-suite level including himself \nwith younger millennials who acted as mentors to train them on the basics of using internet. Since \nthen, there is no looking back as reverse mentoring has found its place in multiple sectors and \norganizations including tea cher training (Porras et al., 2018), geriatric social integration (Breck at al., \n2018), and social network training in academics (Morris, 2017).

Digital coaching is defined as ‘a digital -\ntechnology -enabled, synchronous conversation between a hum an coach and a human coachee’, \nwhich is distinct from artificial intelligence (AI) coaching (Diller & Passmore, 2023: 1). Coaching \ntraining is traditionally delivered face -to-face, yet the COVID -19 pandemic has shifted its delivery \nonline or in hybrid set tings. Our enquiry follows a small -scale quantitative study which indicates \nthat playfulness and creative approaches embedded in digital coaching education affects positively \nthe self -awareness, self -reflection, and self -confidence of the students (Mangion -Thornley, 2023). \nHowever, little is known about how creative coaching approaches may be used in online coaching \neducation to facilitate learning (Passmore & Woodward, 2023). It is important to explore how \ncreative approaches could be adapted to support th e development of digital coaches.   \n \nTheoretical base  \nCreativity in coaching has emerged in the coaching literature in the past decade (Gash, 2019; \nTurner, 2020, 2022, 2023; Turner & Norris, 2022; Clutterbuck, 2023, Wheeler and Leyman, 2023). \nElements such as the use of mediating objects form a wider circle o f ideas linked to andragogy. \nThese techniques have been borrowed or re -interpreted within the co -coaching relationship which, \nitself, requires a more relaxed experiential set of approaches. From an adult learning perspective, \nthis study draws on the semina l work of Rogers and Freiberg, Freedom to Learn (1970; 1994), which \nposes creativity and curiosity as two principles for enabling the learner to become ‘the architect of \nhimself’ (Lones, 2000: 9), with trust and interpersonal relationship as pivotal to adu lt learning (2013). \nThis is relevant to coaching education considering the importance of developing authenticity in \ncoaching style and practice (Bachkirova, 2016).  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThis working paper is based on our reflections as coach educators on the use of creative techniques \nin digital coaching education. We use a collective auto -ethnographic approach (Koning & Moore, \n2020), which provides a method to explore intersubjectively o ur experience of engaging with our \nparticipants. Our aim is to reflect on how creative coaching techniques and tools can be adapted in \nthe digital space and how they may support the development of authentic coaches. We adopt an \ninductive qualitative approa ch and will use thematic analysis method (Clark & Braun, 2017) to \nidentify any patterns, discrepancies and key themes emerging from the data.    \n \nResearch questions  \n• What creative tools and techniques can we bring to the digital coaching space to support the \nlearning and development of coaches?  \n• How may creative coaching approaches support the learning and development of coaches \nwhen used in the digital space?  \n• What lessons can be learned from this study to inform the future practice of coach \neducators and coaches working digitally?  \n  \nImplications for HRD practice  \nIt is hoped that this study will raise awareness of how creative tools and techniques can be used \neffectively when coaching and/or facilitating other learning and development (L&D) programmes"

Individuals benefit from greater access to powerful networks, career advancement \nopportunities, and professional development. Organizations benefit f rom employees with greater \njob satisfaction, engagement, and desire to stay with the organization (Wilson & Elman, 1990). \nMentoring is useful both for new and seasoned professionals, and, by adopting a relational \nmentoring framework (Ragins & Verbos, 2017) , individuals in a mentoring relationship can \nexperience mutual benefit (Dobrow et al., 2012). It is, however, important to take issues of diversity, \nequity, and inclusion (DEI) into account when designing and deploying mentoring interventions. For \nexample , by incorporating explicit discussions of privilege, identity, and power, greater authenticity \ncan be achieved in mentoring relationships (Ghosh et al., 2020). In this manuscript, we discuss our \nwork on developing mentor training that incorporates DEI con cepts and discussions. A series of \nworkshops was delivered over the course of a year to faculty and students in an adolescent health \nprogram. The training modules we delivered included topics like uncovering privilege and \noppression, mentoring with care, a nd having culturally conscious conversations. We utilized aspects \nof experiential learning in delivering the modules such that participants were asked to practice \nvarious mentoring skills with other participants before utilizing them in their assigned ment oring \npartnerships. This manuscript will describe the various HRD theories that undergirded our \napproach as well as the specific DEI theories we incorporated into the trainings. Additionally, we will \ndiscuss how the curriculum was both designed and deliver ed as well as its impact.  \n \nReferences  \n \nDobrow, S. R., Chandler, D. E., Murphy, W. M., & Kram, K. E. (2012).

      "text": "45 \nID:189 - Overwhelmed, Lonely, Isolated: Reverse Mentoring, A Magical Wand \nfor Neurodiverse Inclusion  \nSanghamitra Chaudhuri & Karen R Johnson  \nABSTRACT  \n \n“There are four words I will never forget hearing: “Your son is Autistic.” After that, I didn’t hear \nanything the child psychologist said because I was fighting back the tears and thinking about how \nthis was going to affect his future in this world. My son was neurodivergent, and it’s a diagnosis that \ndoesn’t come with a manual because no two autism diagnoses are the same. It also means that one \nday, he may have to struggle to find support for neurodiversity in the workplace.” (Holtzlander, \n2023)  \n \nThe aforementioned excerpt underscores the existing lack of preparedness in contemporary \norganizations when it comes to hiring, managing, engaging, and retaining neurodiverse employees. \nTheoretical physics genius Albert Einstein, acting diva Jennifer Anist on, and environmental activist \nGreta Thunberg are all glaring examples of neurodiverse individuals. Neurodivergence refers to “a \nnatural range of differences in human brain functions in the workplace based on alternative \nthinking styles, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dyspraxia and \ndyslexia” (Szulc et al., 2021, pg. 858). Organizations are far from inclusive in creating a culture that is \nconducive to the neurodivergent employees as they often fall prey to isolation, stigmat ization, \nstereotyping, and biases (Hedley at el., 2018; Muller et al., 2003, Maroto & Pettinicchio, 2015) \nimpacting their mental health and overall well -being (Mastroianni & Storberg -Walker, 2014).  In fact, \na recently published article in MIT Sloan review  shared that while the global market for diversity, \nequity, and inclusion is expected to reach $28.9 billion by 2030, a significant oversight exists in most \nDEI programs where they tend to neglect neurodiversity. Despite indications that 15% to 20% of the \nglobal population is neurodivergent, only 1 in 10 organizations explicitly incorporates neurodiversity \ninto their DEI initiatives (Russo et al., 2023). The challenge of creating an inclusive and supportive \nenvironment exponentially increases as there is no  one-size-fits-all approach to understanding such \nindividuals since they all come with their own unique strengths and weaknesses with diverse skills \nand abilities. Therefore, in order to embrace neurodiverse employees, organizations should \ndeliberately imp lement strategies that would encourage productivity, collaboration, and their \nengagement and subsequent growth. It should be noted that typical organizational strategies \nincluding training and coaching may not be enough in enabling these employees to thriv e. However, \nunconventional interventions, like ‘reverse mentoring’ could be an answer where hierarchical lines \nare diffused and employees with lived experiences are at the forefront of guiding their employers \non what best supports their development and gro wth.   \n \nThe Self -Determination Theory (SDT) of motivation, proposed as a valuable framework for guiding \nemployment for neurodiverse employees (Goldfarb et al., 2019), focuses on understanding the \nmotivation underlying work choices and the extent to which an indivi dual's behavior is self -\ndetermined. SDT encapsulates a set of three basic personal and psychological needs of autonomy, \ncompetence, and relatedness that are imperative for individuals’ growth and wellbeing (Dec et al., \n2017; Deci & Ryan, 2008). Autonomy is  the feeling that one has choice and having the ability to \nregulate oneself during life’s events. Competence means having mastery over one’s abilities and \nskills and being able to adapt to the environment. Relatedness is having a sense of belonging and \nconnectedness with others (Ryan & Deci, 2000). All three components are key drivers of motivated \nbehavior. The extent to which the three psychological needs are met is essential for optimal \nfunctioning in one’s environment including work (Ryan & Deci, 2000). It is important to create \nopportunities to satisfy one or more of these three basic needs to foster motivation."

      "text": "46 \nNeurodiverse individuals often find themselves compelled to take on jobs that may not align with \ntheir abilities or involve tasks that fail to capture their interest to secure employment. When there is \na misalignment between job roles and personal interest s, it can lead to a decline in motivation, \nsubsequently resulting in turnover and diminished employment stability (Goldfarb et al., 2021). By \nunderstanding and applying SDT principles, organizations can create environments that \nacknowledge the autonomy and  competence of neurodiverse individuals, promoting their intrinsic \nmotivation and overall job satisfaction.  \n \nIn this context, introducing reverse mentoring could be an effective intervention. Reverse mentoring \nis an inverted form of mentoring whereby the seasoned and more experienced workers are paired \nas mentees with more junior and less experienced employees (M urphy, 2012; Chaudhuri & Ghosh, \n2012, Chaudhuri et al., 2021). Allowing neurodiverse employees to mentor their supervisors, who \nmay be neurotypical and communicate specific needs, insights, and unique perspectives that would \ncontribute to their sustained e ngagement and satisfaction in the workplace.  This approach not only \npromotes a more inclusive workplace culture but also directly addresses the psychological needs \noutlined in SDT.  Neurodiverse mentors can enhance the competence of their neurotypical \ncolleagues by increasing their shared understanding of neurodiversity issues thereby fostering a \nsense of relatedness through increased empathy and collaboration. This, in turn, can significantly \ncontribute to the engagement and retention of neurodiverse empl oyees, as they feel valued.  \n \nThe purpose of our paper is to provide an overview on neurodiverse individuals and their unique \nchallenges as they try to assimilate in organizations and how reverse mentoring can be the conduit \nto help them feel more valued and engaged, thereby enhancing their work outcomes and retention \nin the organization.   \n \nThe findings of this paper can assist HRD professionals in developing a comprehensive reverse \nmentoring program in their organization that would specifically be targeted at engaging and \nretaining neurodivergent employees.   \n \nReferences  \n \nChaudhuri, S., & Ghosh, R.

However, the advent of digitalization presents new challenges to this goal. Various studies \ndelineate that an authentic and impactful coaching process necessitates coaches to pos sess a \nprofound self -awareness, through which they may explain and really embody their professional \nidentity. Coach training programmes prioritise the enhancement of participants' self -awareness and \nproficiency in using different coaching tools. However, t hey fail to directly acknowledge the \nauthenticity dilemmas that aspiring coaches encounter on their journey to become a coach. This \nstudy investigates the authenticity dilemmas encountered by 25 individuals participating in a year -\nlong online coach trainin g course. This study examines how participants experience digitalization \nrelated authenticity challenges, either as threats to their professional identity that they address via \nidentity work, or as opportunities that they address through identity play. The  research included \nparticipants who engaged in semi -structured self -interviews to explore their perceptions of \nprofessional authenticity, as well as the issues and obstacles they encountered.  Thematic data \nanalysis was applied, uncovering two main experie nces of authenticity dilemmas. In the first case, \nauthenticity meant becoming your “true self”, where authenticity dilemmas were perceived as \nthreats, and reparatory identity work was applied. In the second case authenticity was situational, \nand participan ts engaged in identity play.

Mentoring is an \nestablished tool to help individuals develop in their careers, where a senior colleague provides \ndevelopmental support formally or informally (Bergelson, 2014). Mentees experience accelerated \ncareer advancement and overall financial prosperity (McGuire 2014). However, current mentoring \napproaches often fail to adequately support women due to a lack of available mentors in positions \nof power and the hierarchical structure that does not align with the developmental  needs of \nmarginalized women. (Méndez -Morse, 2004). The literature is also inconsistent on if United States \nand international -based populations experience mentoring similarly (Ghosh et al., 2022).  \nFeminist mentoring through virtual platforms offers an alternative for women in patriarchal \norganizational settings. It transcends typical career and psycho -social support, integrating political \nawareness, mutual learning, and dismantling biases and inequa lities to better assist women's \ncareer advancement. Therefore, women can rely on technology to engage in the mentoring process \ncircumventing inaccessibility in their current organizations. However, few studies properly explore \nthis approach and provide a p arsimonious conceptualization (Manongsong & Collins, 2020). The \nstudy aims to validate the \"Feminist Mentoring Behaviors Scale\" (FMBS) through literature review, \nexpert collaboration, and data collection from US and international populations, anticipating validity \nand reliability assessments.  \n \nMethodology  \nWe conducted item generation in two rounds: literature review and collaboration with subject \nmatter experts familiar with feminist mentoring. Next, due to limited access to women workers, \nMTRUK participants will be recruited via CloudResearch. The survey i ncludes screener questions on \nmentoring experiences, the FMBS scale, and demographic items. We are anticipating two rounds of \ndata collection (500 participants in the USA and 500 outside). Inclusion criteria include identification \nas a woman, age 18 or old er, and employment. Demographics like race, marital status, etc., may \nallow for potential intersectional analysis. We will then run validity tests, including convergent, \npredictive, and discriminant validity through correlational analysis, multiple regress ion, as well as \nexploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, respectively.  \n \nLikely Conclusions & HRD Implications  \nExpected outcomes include the identification of key behaviors of feminist mentoring, enabling \nfuture studies to explore its impact on women's career outcomes. We anticipate significant \nassociations between the FMBS and related constructs in extant literatu re, including positive \ncorrelations with traditional mentoring, holding behaviors, and negative association with negative \nmentoring to support convergent validity. For discriminant validity, the FMBS should represent a \ndistinct construct from similar model s (relational mentoring and cross -cultural counseling). For \npredictive validity, the FMBS should increase mentoring satisfaction, improve mentoring \nrelationship quality, reduce impostor feelings, and enhance self -efficacy in career decision -making.  \nFurthermore, a validated FMBS could assist HRD practitioners in developing more effective \nmentoring strategies to promote women's representation in leadership roles across industries, \naiding in overcoming career barriers.

      "text": "53 \nID:21 - Practitioners’ recommendations on diversity within a South African \nhigher education human resource development curriculum  \nNatalie Jonck -Small, Helen Meyer & Renier Els  \nABSTRACT  \n \nPaper’s importance  \nIntegrating diversity into the human resource development (HRD) curriculum is a significant \norganisational (McGuire & Bagher, 2010) and HRD challenge. Despite recognising workplace \ndiversity's essential role, there is a call to address its limited represen tation in HRD education, \nuniversity curricula, and research (Bierema, 2010b; Hite & McDonald, 2010; Zachmeier & Cho, 2013; \nHall, 2018).  \n \nThe implications of neglecting diversity in HRD education are underscored, emphasising adverse \nconsequences for students, employers, and society (Hall, 2018). Consequently, new HRD graduates \nmight enter the workforce with a misperception of diversity (Lim & Rager, 2015). To ensure HRD \ncurriculum relevance, Sambrook and Stewart (2010) recommend incorporating HRD practitioners' \n(HRDPs) input, allowing their workplace experience to inform the HRD curriculum. Hence, this \nqualitative study sought HRDPs' perspect ives for recommendations to inform the South African \nHRD curriculum.  \n \nTheoretical base  \nCritical theory, defined as a framework that examines the interconnection of power structures, \nsocial arrangements, and ideology (Brookfield, 2014; Rocco et al., 2014), underpins this study. \nCritical theory enabled the researcher to explore power dynamics,  social hierarchies, and dominant \nideologies related to diversity and the HRD curriculum (Brookfield, 2011; Bierema & Cseh, 2014; \nRocco et al., 2018).  \n \nDiversity is described as \"the varying ways that people differ\" (Byrd, 2014). Diversity consists of \nvarious dimensions, for example, race, gender, and sexual orientation, among others (Erasmus et \nal., 2019). Diversity in the workplace is a vital corporate strategy, aiming to enhance organisational \nmanagement, gain a competitive edge, and maximise profits (Cletus et al., 2018). Workplace \ndiversity contributes to bottom -line success, cost reduction, and improved employee retention, \nreflecting organisational c are for individuals (O'Donovan, 2017). Despite legislative efforts, \nchallenges persist in fully embracing diversity in South African workplaces (Joubert, 2017).  \n \nDiversity in the workplace must be recognised to ensure inclusive performance and improved \nproduction. It is well known that productivity thrives across varied skills, responsibilities, viewpoints, \nethnicities, and backgrounds within diverse settings (Cletus et al., 2018; Hughes & Byrd, 2015). A \ndiverse environment supports global adaptability, improved management, competitive advantage, \nand profit maximis ation (Kormanik & Rajan, 2010; Cletus et al., 2018) and stimulates personal \ngrowth, critical thinking, and innovation, contributing to organisational performance (Foma, 2014; \nCletus et al., 2018). Failure to recognise organisational diversity could result in negative attitudes, an \nuncomfortable atmosphere, and workplace issues (Bierema, 2010a; O’Donovan, 2017; Cletus et al., \n2018). However, the literature on diversity within HRD curricula reveals a disconnect between its \nperceived importance as a core compe tency for practitioners and its limited integration into \nacademic programmes (Hite et al., 2009; Bierema, 2010). While diversity is acknowledged in some \nHRD courses, it is not consistently covered (Kuchinke, 2002; Bierema, 2010). Consequently, there is a \ngrowing awareness of the importance of diversity in HRD, and there are calls for increased research \nand integration into curricula (Shirmohammadi et al., 2020). This paper addresses these calls as \nevidenced by the research purpose."

      "text": "54 \nResearch purpose  \nThis research aimed to explore HRD practitioners’ recommendations concerning diversity within a \nSouth African higher education HRD curriculum.   \nThe researcher used qualitative research, specifically a qualitative descriptive design (Bradshaw et \nal., 2020) rooted in interpretivism (Chowdhury et al., 2022). The study population included HRD \nalumni who completed undergraduate HRD degrees at a South A frican university. The specific \nuniversity was chosen because it is the only university in SA that offers HRD undergraduate and \npostgraduate degrees. All these HRD alumni are employed in various HRD positions all over South \nAfrica (SA). Thus, the study pop ulation and sample consisted of HRDPs with experience in the HRD \ncurriculum and HRD practice. HRDPs undergraduate HRD qualification also contributed to their \ntheoretical knowledge of HRD and diversity. Therefore, participants could answer the research \nques tions meaningfully. The researcher used purposive sampling, more specifically snowball \nsampling (Maree & Pieterson, 2019), to select nine participants from the study population and \nconducted virtual individual semi -structured interviews with these particip ants.  \nFor data analysis, the researcher prepared the data through transcription, ensuring systematic \ntracking of diverse datasets. To familiarise herself with the data, the researcher applied immersion \ntechniques such as multiple readings and audio replay (Schur ink et al., 2021). The researcher and \ntwo co -coders identified codes by assigning single words to transcript units to generate general \nthemes. The researcher presented themes and descriptions through a narrative and interpreted the \ndata (Creswell & Creswel l 2018). To ensure trustworthiness, the researcher adhered to the quality \ncriteria of credibility (peer scrutiny, member checking, and inter -coder agreement), transferability \n(triangulation using multiple data sources), dependability (keeping a journal), c onfirmability, (audit \ntrail) (Nieuwenhuis, 2019; Schurink et al., 2021) and declared her bias (Creswell 2009). The \nresearcher obtained ethical clearance from the university and adhered to all ethical considerations, \nsuch as informed consent, permission to conduct research, confidentiality, anonymity, no harm, \nand privacy.  \nResearch question/s  \n• What recommendations can HRDPs provide to optimise diversity within a South African \nhigher education HRD curriculum to align the curriculum with the workplace?  \n \nImplications for HRD practice  \nThe research findings highlight significant implications for HRD practice and HRD academics. There \nis a clear need for incorporating diversity education from the undergraduate level throughout the \nHRD curriculum to ensure diversity is optimised and to alig n the curriculum with the workplace \nadequately. Recognising diversity dimensions like language, gender, disability, nationality, age, \neducation, and culture requires tailored and inclusive learning strategies. HRD practitioners should \nutilise respectful an d inclusive learning materials, case studies, and open dialogue to promote \nunderstanding and mutual respect. Understanding the target group and developing tools for \ncreating a culture of diversity and inclusion is crucial for HRD practitioners. HRD practit ioners \nshould understand their target groups, embrace diversity for workplace success and innovation, \nand gain a competitive edge by attracting diverse talent.  \n \nConclusions  \nThis study explored HRDP's recommendations concerning diversity in the HRD curriculum to align \nthe HRD curriculum with SA workplace requirements from a critical theory perspective. The findings \nincluded HRDP recommendations to inform the HRD curricula and HRD practice, which can be \nimplemented in similar contexts. Overall, it became evident that diversity should be introduced \nfrom the undergraduate to postgraduate HRD cu rricula to ensure adequate workplace \nimplementation.  \n \nKeywords:  Diversity, critical theory, human resource development, curriculum, recommendations, \nhuman resource development practitioners."

In the UK academia, \nthe Athena Swan (AS) Charter established in 2005 is considered as a significant innovation to \nimprove women’s representation in senior positions. The AS memb er institutions are encouraged to \ndemonstrate their engagement with Athena Swan's gender equality principles in their award \napplications (Advance HE, 2020). Several studies (for example Barnard, 2017; Caffrey et al., 2016; \nOvseiko et al., 2017) have report ed that the AS accredited universities show a measurable \nimprovement in the structural and cultural barriers women face in those universities. However, \nscholars including Fagan and Teasdale (2021) question the legitimacy of such claims considering \nwomen fa ce persistent inequalities in academia. Furthermore, gender scholars criticise the \nscholarship has yet to establish the reason for women’s continuing peril in academic academia \n(Avolio, 2020).  \n \nResearch purpose  \nUsing a grounded theory approach, the current study addressed this gap by investigating the \nimpact of AS accreditation on the lived experience of early and mid -career academics in UK SET \nsubject areas. A single case study design was implemented, and an AS gold -awarded science \ndepartment [considered beacons of gender equality] was selected for this purpose. The study used \nsemi -structured interviews, document analysis and participant drawings as data collection methods.  \n \nResearch question/s  \nTo reflect the everyday experiences of women academics in an AS gold -awarded department, this \nresearch started with the question:  \n1. What is the impact of Athena Swan accreditation on the lived experiences of women \nacademics?  \nFurther questions emerged during the data collection:   \n2. How do women in negotiate their everyday working life in their lab spaces?  \n3. How do women negotiate their workload in relation to the Athena Swan departmental \ninitiatives?  \n \nImplications for HRD theory and practice  \nContradictory to the previous reports of the positive impact of AS accreditation in improving gender \nequality in accredited institutions, the findings of the current study shows that that the AS \naccreditation has failed to bring any positive impact on the everyday life of women. Furthermore, \nthe AS action plans of the department have not translated into the everyday life of early and mid -\ncareer researchers in this study.  This research extends the gender performative theory \n(Butler,2011) to organisational s paces arguing that the core values in academia remain gendered \nwhere the scientific labour becomes performative for women researchers in these spaces. It \nillustrates the gendered aspects of scientific labour in the lab spaces reproducing gendered \nrelations .  \n \nThe theme of gender performative spaces was related to the workspaces which became embodied \nfor women, where their bodies became highly visible in the lab spaces when it came to performing \nlab cleaning and maintenance work.  However, they become invisible when it comes to jobs \nassociated with masculine strength and toughness including moving lab equipment for which men \nwere preferred (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2015).

While academic housework is understood in terms \nof teaching, administrative and pastoral care, women scientists in the current study were required \nto do the cleaning and maintenance work in their workspaces which is termed as ‘scientific \nmothering’ in this study. These lab spaces became performative for women where they were \nexpected to clean after others, emptying bins, a nd keeping the lab space maintained.  This further \nsymbolises the unpaid domestic labour at home which is often invisible and underappreciated.  \nThe findings further contradicted the studies such that of Tsouroufli (2019)’s whose documentary \nanalysis examined the success and failure of AS accreditation in UK universities and claimed that \nthe workload allocations in AS -accredited departments resulte d in fair workload allocation for \nwomen.  Instead, the current research found that the reported workload allocation model has not \nrecognised the gendered division of work related to scientific work in the labs. This resulted in \nwomen in this study believin g that AS departmental initiatives are a tick -box exercise rather than \ntranslating into real -world impact for them.  \n \nThe findings provide an increased understanding of the AS accreditation program and its \nimplications for accredited universities. The recommendations for the case study organisation can \noffer guidelines for the participating universities and the HR to form  policies and meaningful \npractices when implementing equality and diversity policies/ practices in their institutions.  Though \nthe findings are mainly relevant to the case study department, the gender performativity related to \ngendered organisational space s may be relevant to those departments that are attempting to \nimplement equality and diversity practices in their workplace.  Secondly, it provides Athena Swan \nitself an insight into the drawbacks of the self -accreditation programme which they can review a nd \nimprove.  \n \nConclusions  \nTo conclude the findings of this research reject the previous claims of AS success portrayed through \nworkload allocation models (Tsouroufli, 2019) and argue that gender becomes performativity in the \nlab spaces for women where women’s embodied status requir es them to perform mothering role \nwhich relates to the unrecognised, unpaid, poorly regarded and time -consuming nature of \nacademic housework (Herman, 2018). The findings further imply that the scientific mothering of \ncleaning after others and maintaining t he lab which is time -consuming service work may take \nwomen away from actual rewarding research work which might hinder their career advancement \nopportunities (Macfarlane and Burg, 2019; Misra et al., 2017). This answers the questions raised by \nstudies on w hy succession to senior roles can be harder for women, especially in SET subject areas.  \n \nReferences  \n \nAthena Swan Charter | Advance HE., 2020., www.advance -he.ac.uk.

Since the USA ha s welcomed nearly 90,000 Afghan refugees in \nthe aftermath of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 (US Department of State, 2023), there \nis an urgent need to understand the challenges and opportunities that these refugees face in their \nnew environmen t, as well as the factors and strategies that facilitate or hinder their successful \nintegration.  \n \nThe unprecedented number in the recent history of US refugee admissions poses tremendous \nlogistical and humanitarian pitfalls for the federal government and its partners. As for the Afghan \nrefugees who were forced to leave everything behind including their  close family members, they \nconfronted the new unknown reality of resettling in a completely foreign country during uncertain \nand unsettled times (Rai, Held and Haymes, 2023). Amid increased stress levels, trauma, and fear of \nwhat the future could bring, t his vulnerable population grapples with multiples challenges to adjust \nand integrate the fabric of American life.  \n \nIn this paper, we focus on the challenges and the prospects of an effective integration of Afghan \nrefugees into the American society, culture, and economy. We draw on the experiences of previous \nrefugee groups, such as the Somalis, the Iraqis, and Syrians as well as the current policies and \npractices of the federal, state, and local governments, and the civil society organizations.  \nConsidering the diversity of the Afghan refugee population, which consists of different ethnic, \nreligious, linguistic, and educational backgrounds, and different levels of exposure to violence and \npersecution, we will first present a comprehensive overview  of their demographic characteristics \nand their geographic distribution in the U.S. We also note that “many Afghan refugees arrive \nunprepared for settlement in the U.S. and depend on government assistance during the first few \nyears after resettlement.” (St empel and Alemi (2021, p. 4873)  \n \nSecond, we will discuss the many challenges this at -risk group encounters as it leads its life in the \nUS. Examples include the phenomenon of violence. Savun & Gineste (2019) claim that it is more \nprevalent against refugees than by them. They contend that r efugees are especially prone to having \ntheir physical integrity rights violated by host states after terrorist attacks occur. They offer \nsuggestive evidence that host state leaders use refugees as ‘scapegoats’ to divert blame and \nappease voters after terro rist attacks, and that this allows them to get away with violating refugees’ \nrights. This builds on Onoma’s (2013) observation that refugees are often subjected to violence in \nhost states.  \n \nIt is also suggested that Afghan refugees suffer from discrimination and xenophobia which are \nserious problems affecting other groups of refugees. The increased Islamophobia over the past few \nyears, has promoted hatred against Muslims in the US in general (Alfonseca, 2021; Konig -Reis, \n2017).  \n \nAnother key challenge is access to education, which is a pillar for refugees to enhance their abilities \nand knowledge, and to become part of their new communities. However, refugees may encounter \ndifficulties in this area due to language barriers, lack of educational opportunities, and cultural"

Housing instability can affect their ability to integrate and build new \nrelationships in their communities (Refugee Council USA, Sept ember 2021). Besides, Afghan \nrefugees may have health issues related to their experiences in Afghanistan, such as injuries or \ntrauma from violence or displacement. Accessing healthcare in the USA can be challenging, \nespecially if refugees are not familiar with the US healthcare system (National Immigration Forum, \nAugust 2021). Additionally, building social connections and support networks is important for \nrefugees to feel welcomed and integrated into their new communities. However, language and \ncultural dif ferences, as well as trauma from their experiences, may make it difficult for refugees to \nestablish social connections (Rai et al. 2023). As a result, economic integration and access to jobs \nbecomes tough and may get tougher, if refugees have difficulty in  obtaining recognition or \nverification of their foreign degrees, certificates, or licenses. At times, it might be hard to assimilate \nthe work culture and behave according to the organizational norms. In general refugees may have \nlimited knowledge or awaren ess of the U.S. labor market, the job opportunities, the application \nprocess, or the legal rights and responsibilities.  \n \nThird, we contend that the integration of Afghan refugees in the American eco -system requires a \nholistic and long -term approach that addresses their diverse and complex needs, such as affordable \nhousing, education, health, employment, language, and social inclusion. It also entails sufficient \nresources and coordination among various stakeholders, such as the federal, state, and local \ngovernments, the resettlement agencies, the civil society organizations, and the host communities. \nMoreover, it involves reco gnizing and appreciating the potential contributions of Afghan refugees to \nthe American society, culture, and economy, as well as respecting and protecting their human rights \nand dignity. Therefore, in the fourth section, we highlight some of these contrib utions to the \nAmerican society, such as their skills, talents, entrepreneurship, and cultural diversity. We conclude \nwith some policy recommendations and best practices for enhancing the integration outcomes and \nwell-being of Afghan refugees and the Americ an host community.  \n \nKeywords:  Afghan Refugees, USA, social and economic Integration, Challenges, Prospects, Holistic \nstrategy  \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nAlfonseca, K.

This positive outlook of the study motivated us to conduct research \non women leaders’ resistanc e to examine how they resisted their token status to create new norms. \nThe purpose of this study, therefore, was to develop a typology of women leaders’ resistance to \ntheir token status in the workplace, using the ideal -type analysis (Stapley et al., 2021,  2022), which is \na qualitative research method used for the construction of typologies from qualitative data in a \nsystematic manner. Before going through the ideal type analysis process, we reviewed the literature \non women leaders’ resistance including Cha udhary and Dutt (2022), Cho et al. (2021b), Jamjoom and \nMills (2023), and Park et al. (2020), all of which conducted research on women leaders in diverse \nsectors (e.g., business) in non -Western contexts (e.g., South Korea) using interviews. In the review o f \nthe literature, we identified commonalities (e.g., rejecting stereotypes) and differences (e.g., \nreflection, silence) among emergent themes.  \n \nTo go through the ideal type analysis process, we chose 145 narratives collected from seven \nqualitative studies that were previously conducted (Cho et al., 2015, Cho et al., 2016, Cho et al., \n2017, Cho et al., 2019, Cho et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2021a; Han  et al., 2018). After being familiarized \nwith the narratives, we discussed until we reached consensus on five types of resistance identified \nas a result of the 2x2 matrix analysis: environmental readiness and the level of individual resistance. \nFor instanc e, Type 1 is defined as showing a favorable environment (e.g., an organization or \nindustry) and a women leader’s active resistance (e.g., culture change). After reviewing the assigned \ntranscripts (narratives) independently, all met to discuss until a colle ctive decision was made about \na given type and ended up with four types of resistance, which were indicated in the literature. \nHowever, we also discovered Type 5, which extant literature did not address or classify, as a few \nnarratives show a women leader’ s change in their perspective of work -life balance by becoming \nmore balanced from being work -oriented. This change seemed to occur with such experiences as \nfemale medical doctors’ sabbaticals and female entrepreneurs’ career transitions. A team of three \nresearchers worked through the reliability check to finalize the five types of women leaders’ \nresistance. Remaining steps include forming the ideal -type descriptions, checking credibility, and \nmaking comparisons.  \n \nThis study contributes to research on women in leadership: first, this study is the first effort in HRD \nresearch to show the possibility of an untapped exploration in qualitative research using the ideal \ntype analysis; second, the typology developed will add more explanatory power to Kanter’s \ntokenism theory by presenting how women leaders use resistance as a coping strategy to create \nopportunities as leaders in the organization; third, the typology will illustrate how women leaders \nuse resistance to overcome challenges in male -dominated organi zations, with consideration of the \nunique cultural context, as in Korea; and lastly, the typology of women leaders’ resistance can be \nused for the development of women in the leadership pipeline in ways that show how they can \nstrike a balance between their  efforts to effectively maneuver in the organization and their \nawareness of going their own way to bring in change in the organization.  \n \nReferences"

The objective of this \npaper is to demonstrate that while WD has helped organizations in the global south become more \nproductive and competitive in local and international markets , it is important to acknowledge that \nthe impact of WD on societal (specifically the labor market) and individual levels is not entirely \npositive. WD has contributed to the deterioration of the labor market and the alienation of workers \nin global south cou ntries. This is partially due to the differences in the labor market in these \ncountries, characterized by higher levels of informal economy and lower levels of education. \nConsequently, workers who do not fall into the category of talented workers have face d \nimpoverishment and struggle to transition into more skilled segments.  \n \nIn this paper, I will analyze five different variables that have fostered WD in global south countries \nand have had positive effects on organizational effectiveness. However, these variables have not \nhad equally positive effects on the individual and socia l levels, particularly within the labor market. \nThe variables to be analyzed are: (a) employability, (b) merit culture, (c) individualism, (d) talent \nconcept, and (e) value creation. Through this analysis, it is concluded that Strategic HRM is creating \nan elite class in the global south, equalizing the highly talented workers of the global north. While \nthis enables organizations and talented workers to compete globally, it comes at the expense of \nleaving a significant portion of the workforce in marginalize d jobs with limited prospects for \ndevelopment. Each subsection of the analysis will include an examination of the organizational, \nsocial, and individual levels.  \n \nFollowing these analyses, and utilizing the same factors that were previously examined, I will \npresent some alternatives to improve the influence of strategic human resources management in \nthe region. These alternatives should be viewed as starting points to shift Strategic HRM's role from \none of separation to integration and development, fostering a more inclusive and equitable labor \nmarket in the global south.  \n \nKeywords:  Workforce differentiation, Strategic HRM, Global south"

These issues, combined with age -discrimination law, have resulted in organisations \nimplementing policies  to extend working lives (EWL).  Mainstream HRD contributes to EWL and \nthereby ensuring equality and diversity through, for example, providing later -career development \nopportunities.  However, such contributions can reinforce disadvantage, and the potentia l of HRD \nfor EWL in socially just ways to ensure equity and inclusion has yet to be realised.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \n \nThe emerging Critical HRD approach (Bierma et al., 2024) has much to contribute to achieving social \njustice in EWL.  Therefore, this theoretical working -paper has three purposes.  First, to examine the \nCritical HRD approach and to show how while mainstream  HRD is well intentioned, older -workers \nmight be disadvantaged through the perpetuation of hegemonic, performative narratives.  Second, \nto critically theorise later -career in terms of identity threats and transitions.  Third, to propose new \ndirections for HRD in relation to equity and inclusivity.  \n \nResearch Question/s  \n \nThe three research questions are as follows.  First, to what extent does the current emphasis within \nmainstream HRD on enabling equality and diversity in organisations, ameliorate the disadvantage \nexperienced by older -workers?  Second, how can HRD be better theorised to inform research and \npractice for EWLs?  Third, how can thi s theorising enable HRD to better support equity and inclusion \nfor older -workers?  \n \nTheoretical Base  \n \nThe paper analyses and evaluates the extensive theorisation of later -career but notes the restricted \ntheoretical bases of HRD in general.  In deepening understanding of HRD in relation to EWL, the \npaper critically evaluates social constructionist identity theorising (Black et al., 2018) showing how \nlater -career poses identity opportunities but also identity threats.  The paper then builds upon \nidentity theorising using the Foucaultian notion of governmentality (Bardon et al., 2023) to show \nhow HRD can be co mplicit in restricting the identity positions available to older -workers thereby \nworking against inclusivity and denying social justice.  \n \nImplications for HRD  \n \nThe findings of the study have implications for HRD in three areas.  For HRD researchers, the \npotential of a critical approach for extending theoretical understanding is shown.  For HRD \npractitioners, it is established that critical reflection is needed on  how established approaches to \nEWL might perpetuate disadvantage for workers in later -career.

Various \nstatistics illustrate this reality, notably the racial wage gap which reveals Black workers in the United \nStates typically earn about 24% less than White workers (Wilson & Darity, 2022). This gap worsens \nwhen disaggregated by race and gender showing that Black, Latina, and Indigenous, women make \nroughly 60 cents per dollar earned by White men (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2022). \nThus, in our study we focu s on race because racialization and racism continue to be part of the \nhuman experience for racial minorities within the United States and other multi -racial societies \n(Nkomo, 2021; Roberson, 2023; Paluch & Shum, 2023). We also realize that the historical e xistence \nof workplace racism has significant implications on how antiracism is presently enacted within \norganizations (Bohonos & James -Gallaway, 2022).  \nLike many others around the world, renewed attention to racism was met within the human \nresource development (HRD) community after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. In response, the \nAcademy of HRD Board issued a statement in support of Black lives and formed a standing Anti -\nRacism Committee. HRD journals were also attentive to racism. Yet, despite this surge of interest \ntoward race, the AHRD community has not produced a literature review specifi cally focused on race \nconscious research in HRD.  \n \nPurpose, Research Questions, and Theoretical Base  \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to provide an up -to-date review of race conscious research in HRD that \nwill provide analysis of the state of race in the field and suggest directions for future research. \nQuestions driving this research include 1) What topics a re reoccurring within race -conscious \nliterature in HRD? 2) What frameworks have been leveraged to engage in discussion about race in \nHRD?  \n \nMethods  \n \nIn this structured literature review researchers searched all Academy of Human Resource \nDevelopment and University Forum for Human Resource Development affiliated journals (Human \nResource Development Review, Human Resource Development International, Human Resource \nDevelopment Quarterly, Advances in Developing Human Resources, and European Journal of \nTraining and Development) as well as New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource \nDevelopment and identified over 50 articles focused on race or racism in  HRD journals between \n2010 and 2023. The research shows that over half of all articles in the review period were published \nin the final three -years of the review window.  \n \nImplications for Practice and Conclusions  \n \nIn this in -progress research paper, several factors will be analyzed including research methods most \ncommonly used, the theories and core constructs that inform the work, prevalent themes, which \nracial groups receive the most focus, what identities are dis cussed as intersectionally linked to race, \nwhich national contexts the research was conducted in, and which HRD journals have demonstrated"

In an era where the elderly \nworkforce is exp anding, understanding their unique challenges, such as adapting to new \ntechnologies and generational differences in the workplace, becomes crucial (Beitler et al., 2018; El -\nHosany, 2017). These challenges can significantly influence their job satisfaction and overall \nperformance (Frone, 2000).  \n \nThe research aims to unravel the intricate dynamics between conflict, problem -solving, health \nstatus, and job satisfaction in elder workers. By focusing on positive problem -solving strategies, the \nstudy seeks to offer new perspectives on reducing workplace  tensions and enhancing colleague \nrelationships (Hillman, 2014). The inclusion of health status as a key factor recognizes its impact on \nwork capacity and interpersonal interactions, which may exacerbate workplace conflicts. This aspect \nis especially relev ant in understanding work -family issues and the motives of older workers in the \nworkplace (Thrasher, Zabel, Wynne, & Baltes, 2016). Furthermore, the comprehensive approach to \nconflict resolution in the workplace proposed in this study aligns with the guide lines and strategies \noutlined by Masters and Albright (2002).  \n \nThese findings hold substantial significance for human resource management, particularly in \nsocieties undergoing rapid demographic shifts. Understanding how elder workers handle conflicts \nand the role of their health status can assist organizations in form ulating customized strategies to \nsupport this segment of the workforce, thereby fostering a harmonious and productive workplace \nenvironment. Other studies further emphasize the importance of organizational support in \nbalancing personal and professional lif e and in understanding age -related differences in conflict \nmanagement strategies(Haji & Rahman, 2021; Yeung et al., 2015). These insights are crucial not only \nfor effective human resource practices but also for policy making aimed at efficiently managing \nelder workers in modern work settings.  \n \nTheoretical base  \n \nThis study is theoretically grounded in the intersection of interpersonal conflict, job satisfaction, and \nhealth status, especially within the context of the elderly workforce. Central to this exploration is the \napplication of conflict resolution theories,  which suggest that fostering positive problem -solving \nattitudes can effectively mediate workplace conflicts, ultimately enhancing job satisfaction among \nelder workers (Hillman, 2014). These theories emphasize the significance of employing constructive \nmethods to resolve conflicts and promote improved intergenerational relationships within the \nworkplace (De Dreu & Van Dierendonck, 2004).  \n \nFurthermore, the research incorporates principles from health psychology, emphasizing the crucial \nrole of physical and mental health in elder employees' work performance and conflict resolution \ncapabilities.

This research aims to unders tand how elder workers manage \nconflicts in the workplace and how these conflicts, along with their problem -solving approach and \nhealth condition, influence their job satisfaction (Frone, 2000). By exploring these aspects, the study \naims to provide valuable  insights for Human Resource Development (HRD) and organizational \nbehavior, especially in developing strategies and policies that support and accommodate the elder \nworkforce to improve their well -being and productivity in the workplace (Appelberg et al., 1 991; \nFaucett et al., 2013).  \n \nImplications for HRD practice  \n \nThis study presents strategic HRD interventions aimed at enhancing job satisfaction among elder \nemployees through initiatives in conflict resolution and health -based customization. Emphasis is \nplaced on developing training programs for elder employees that  promote positive problem -solving \nstrategies, addressing challenges like adapting to technology and bridging generational gaps (Lim & \nLing, 2012). Additionally, the importance of Health Status -Driven Customization in HRD strategies is \nhighlighted, advocati ng for flexible work arrangements and ergonomic workspace designs catering \nto the physical and mental health needs of elder employees (Khamlub et al., 2013).  \n \nOrganizations are urged to focus on comprehensive health and wellness initiatives specifically for \nthe elder workforce. These include regular health screenings and stress management sessions, \naimed at enhancing overall health and improving conflict managem ent skills (Kossek & Ozeki, 1998). \nCreating an inclusive organizational culture is also essential, promoting respect and \nintergenerational collaboration to improve mutual understanding and communication.  \n \nThe study recommends incorporating feedback and continuous improvement measures to assess \nand refine HRD interventions, ensuring their ongoing effectiveness for elder employees. \nFurthermore, it suggests that the findings be used to formulate organizational  policies supportive of \nelder employees. These policies should address issues like ageism, provide flexible retirement \noptions, and offer continuous learning and career development opportunities, all geared towards \nsupporting the elder workforce within org anizations.  \n \nConclusion  \n \nIn summary, this study illuminates the management and support of an elder workforce, with a focus \non the relationship between workplace conflicts and job satisfaction. Key findings demonstrate the \nsignificant role of positive problem -solving attitudes in mediating the effects of  workplace conflicts \non job satisfaction. Additionally, the study highlights the beneficial impact of good health status in \nmitigating conflict -related negative outcomes (Lee et al., 2020).  \n \nThe study's practical recommendations for HRD and organizational practices include implementing \ncustomized conflict resolution programs and comprehensive health initiatives tailored to the elder"

Even though scholars have called for exp anding the understanding and deconstruction \nof privilege (e.g., Black and Stone, 2005; Case et al., 2012; McIntosh, 2012; Rocco and West, 1998), \nlittle has been done. Privilege affects workplaces and workers in terms of engagement (Shuck et al., \n2016), and  organizational culture and dynamics (Clark et al., 2002). Organizations are positioned to \ninfluence systems of power and privilege, which then enable organizational conditions that impact \nemployee attitudes (Shuck et al., 2016). Employee attitudes also in fluence organizational culture, \nnorms, and relationships. Organizational culture, team building and maintenance, relationships \nbetween workers and supervisor -subordinate relationships are affected by earned and unearned \nprivilege in any workplace. We belie ve there is a need to critically examine how earned and \nunearned privilege affects work -based relationships.  \n \nResearch purpose  \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to understand the influence privilege has on relationships at work.  \n \nResearch question/s  \n• How does unearned and earned privilege influence work relationships between colleagues?  \n• How does unearned and earned privilege influence supervisor -subordinate relationships at \nwork?  \n• How does unearned and earned privilege of team members influence teamwork?  \n \nTheoretical basis  \n \nPrivilege is “any unearned asset or benefit received by virtue of being born with a particular \ncharacteristic” (Rocco & West, 1998), which might include “unearned advantage” to safe spaces and \n“conferred dominance” when one group has power over another (Mc Intosh 1989, p. 10). A person \ncan have intersecting identities that bestow unearned advantage (privilege) and disadvantage \nsimultaneously.  Earned privileges are “any earned conditions, skill, asset, or talent that benefit its \npossessor” (Bailey, 1998: 109 ). Earned privilege is attained through effort directed at achieving a \ngoal (Rocco and West, 1998) though access to the resources needed to achieve the goal is often \neasier to attain if one enjoys unearned privilege (Rocco et al., 2023). Earned or unearned  privileges, \noften experienced at the individual level, are manifested and operationalized by power at the \norganizational level, and power needs to be understood within relationships between individuals \nwith different identities (Shuck et al., 2016). Intro duced intersectionality to diverse social identities \n(e.g., age, class, (dis)ability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation) are intersecting \nand interdependent shaping experience (Crenshaw (1989) Cho et al., 2013). Employees make sense \nof their tasks and the workplace through workplace relationships. Individuals develop relationships \nin the workplace by exchanging and coordinating knowledge and ideas (Teboul & Cole, 2005). \nTeboul and Cole (2005) suggest three tenets to relationship develo pment – exploration, \ndevelopment, and maintenance and fluctuation."

Moreover, disruptions like increased reliance on digital technologies, COVID -19, \nBREXIT, and the war in Ukra ine (Sky News, 2023, Carroll, 2024) inform current realities and \ndiscussions about citizens' work life integration within geographical spaces (Dwivedi, Y. K. et al. \n2020; Ekuma, 2023). Employees in the workplace are continuously adopting the use of digital  \ntechnologies like AI for task management, increased productivity, work creativity, innovation, writing \nand data management (Reijers, & Coeckelbergh, 2020; Rajagopal & Behl, 2022; Alrasheedi, et al, \n2022) despite the concerns in relation to potential risks  it possess to businesses. (Carroll, 2024).  \nFurthermore, reflecting on the relevance of inclusion and belonging in the workplace (Allen, K. -A. et \nal 2021), this study establishes the need to further understand existing social and evolving \ntechnological influences that impact work -life integrations o f employees from a diversity \nperspective. Consequently, this study aims to explore the impact of digital technologies on the work \nlife integration of migrant women in Scotland. This is with the aim to not only understand how \ndigital technologies are being adapted alongside psychosocial expectations of migrant women, but \nalso to inform human resource development discourse (Rotatori et al, 2021; Watkins & Marsick, \n2023) in relation to intentional practices for advancing inclusion and belonging in the workplac e.  \n \nReferences  \n \nAkobo, L.A. and Stewart, J.

Utilising the theoretical \nframework of social capital (Bourdieu, 1986; Putnam, 2000), t his longitudinal study critically \nexamines initiatives co -imagined, designed, and implemented to facilitate the support of a \nmarginalised community, specifically the Gypsy Traveller Roma Showmen and Boater (GTRSB), in \ntheir pursuit of Education.  \n \nGypsy Traveller Roma Showmen and Boater (GTRSB) are notably underrepresented, for example, in \nHigher Education (HE), with only 3 -4% of the population aged 18 -30 accessing it, as opposed to 43% \nof the general population in the same age group (Greenfields, 2 017). Research findings (Atherton, \nDainty, & Roberts, 2020; Forster, Gallagher, & Cooper, 2020; Mulcahy, Baars, Bowen -Viner, & \nMenzies, 2019) suggest that even when individuals from GTRSB groups enrol in universities, many \nexperience a sense of invisibilit y and feelings of unwelcome. For example, some identify concerns \nabout unconscious bias, low institutional awareness regarding their ethnic identity, and a fear of \nencountering racist stereotypes if they choose to self -identify (Hall, 2020).  \nThis research will share our journey of working with the GTRSB community over nine years to the \npoint where our institution has signed the GTRSB into Higher Education Pledge. The Pledge compels \nparticipating universities to conduct data monitoring, evaluat ion, outreach, and the appointment of \na named contact (Brassington, 2022). In signing the Pledge, the University commits to \nunderstanding and meeting the community's needs, including raising, building, and sharing internal \nand external knowledge awareness.   \n \nOur methodology places a significant emphasis on the participant's voice by utilising a Community -\nBased Participatory Research (CBPR) whose roots lie in Frieire's pedagogy (Heidemann & Almeida, \n2011), aligned to our 'partnership working to seek meaningful data  for social transformation' \n(Byrne, Canavan, & Millar, 2009, p.:68). Employing a phenomenological approach ensured that \nparticipant subjectivity was fundamental and avoided the temptation to prioritise the researcher as \nexpert.  In other words, we chose ex plicitly to go back to 'the things themselves', to paraphrase \nHusserl's (1969) phenomenological motto, and to study worker experiences as framed by the \nworkers themselves rather than make a priori assumptions about them. The task is complex and \ntime -consum ing since it rests on engaging and leveraging the support of many different actors \n(Jongbloed, Enders, & Salerno, 2008). For example, university professional services, senior \nmanagement, local NGOs, the Charity sector, the Council and the Housing Associati on. Engaging \nand linking in partnership forms a holistic educational ecosystem (Niemi, 2016).  \nWe identify the challenge faced by traditional structures, such as Universities, to effectively connect \nwith communities they purport to represent, e.g., in vision statements and demonstrate how it is \nonly when communities play a central role in decision -making and actively participate in design, \nimplementation, and evaluation of interventions is the dream realised. Using action and dialogue, \nthe University's collaborations with the GTRSB communities have created a symbiotic relationship. \nThis symbiosis is an adaptable and responsive system wherein various actors act as subsystems, \noperating in parallel and responding to unpredictable, non -linear, and spontaneous ways \ninfluenced by evolving circumstances. Via the symbiotic relationship, supported by bonding and \nbridging social capital, a cascade of effects is generated, fostering the continuity of the intervention"

Whilst application and  definition can vary CoPs are \ncommonly understood to be a means for professionals to voluntarily share their knowledge and \nexperiences around a specific domain of interest in order to engender changes in practice or \nbehaviour (Arthur’s, 2016; Li, Grimshaw,  Nielsen, Judd, Coyte, & Graham, 2009).  In addition to \nknowledge sharing and learning CoPs play a role in driving innovation (Jørgensen, & Keller,2008; \nMorton, 2012) and due to socio -political factors at play in CoPs used to defend specific interests of a  \nprofessional or managerial groups (Nicolini, 2022). Given their organisational prominence CoPs \nhave received considerable empirical attention but there are calls for further research to \nunderstand how work -related identities shape CoP processes and how Co P mechanisms of \nknowledge and organisational innovation have been shaped by enhanced digitalised and hybrid \nwork (Nicolini et al, 2022, Ajzen, & Taskin,2021 and du Preez, 2010).). In addressing these calls and in \nacknowledgment of the inherent power and po tentially emancipatory role of CoPs, this research \nexamines, through a Critical Sense Making (CSM) lens, how CoPs can drive bottom -up or employee -\nled policy change in enhanced digitalised and hybrid work contexts.  \n \nIn the change management literature, there is not a defined literature on bottom -up or employee \nled change, it tends to be packaged in different ways (e.g. organisational learning, process theory of \nchange, creativity, diffusion of innovations, imposed vs.  evolution in both strategy and change and \nfound within the change agents literature). Yet, a re -focus on bottom -up change is significant in the \nview of the ongoing high rates of change initiatives that fail, often due to a lack of buy -in from \nemployees (R osenbaum et al, 2018). Policy change often fails when employees feel they have \nlimited influence on policy design and implementation (powerlessness) and or that new policy is \nmeaningless to them in terms of their front line role (Tucket et al, 2021). Thus,  CoPs become an \nimportant vehicle for understanding their potential role in of bottom -up change due to members' \nshared interests.  \n \nIn order, to contextualise the research in enhanced and hybrid work contexts Critical Sense Making \n(CSM) theory (Aromaa, Eriksson, Helms Mills, Hiltunen, Lammassaari, & Mills, A. J. ,2019) is applied \nas an alternative to the Weick (1988 and 1995) sensemaki ng approach, which has been critiqued for \nneglecting issues of power and wider contextual factors (Helms Mills, 2003). Weick (1995) defined \nsense making as “the making of sense” (Weick, 1995, p. 4), through making explicit the implicit \nunderstandings of th e actors in the situation, so that choices are made about how to act. (Weick, \nSutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005).  CSM takes this approach further by critically viewing the sensemaker as \nan actor in context with full consideration of power and context to evaluat e agency and the \nsensemaking of researchers themselves (Aromaa, Eriksson, Helms Mills, Hiltunen, Lammassaari, & \nMills, ,2019. Sensemaking and sense giving are both explored in narratives of how bottom -up \nchange can emerge from the CoP and addresses calls f or more research in sense giving experiences \nfrom those other than senior leaders and middle managers. Sensemaking and sensegiving lenses \ncan be used to understand narratives and identity processes in organisations and thus provides a \npractical vehicle to explore how identities are maintained, constructed and reconstructed in \nbottom -up change management activities driven from membership of the CoP."

      "text": "85 \nID:163  – Languages in University Education – A Literature Review  \nEduardo Tomé  & Elizaveta Gromov a \n \nABSTRACT  \nPurpose and Importance  \n \nIn a globalized world languages have importance, because they are like a cultural passport to other \ncultures. In this paper we want to analyse a very specific problem regarding languages – the fact \nthat a student studies in a context in which he or she has  to use as course work language in \nUniversities a language that it is not his main language, and one that he does not speak at home. \nWe believe this divergence may cause much difficulty to the students, and particularly in a very \nspecific situation. This s ituation arises when the language in which the class in performed is an \nofficial language in the country from which the student comes from, but at home in their own \ncountry the students talk in a different language with his family. This situation may happe n in \nrelation to African students, that come from the Anglophone, Francophone or Portuguese Spealing \ncountries in Africa and have home language as dialects, and go to study in the UK, France or \nPortugal respectively. What follows we believe, by having obse rved the phenomena many times, \nthat that difference between language spoken at home and language used in coursework harms \nvery much the results of students. Languages may make them more agile but ignorance and \ncultural barriers make them less agile and les s successful.  Crucially this is an hidden problem, \nsometimes we believe that the students are not even aware of it, and if may really harm their \nsuccess, in Universities and in the labour market. We have not seen any change in the situation for \n10 years, in fact it only got worse because with globalization migration flows increased. And finally, \nthe political powers don’t believe the problem exist – which gives science a great reason to step in.    \nIn consequence we intend to do a study in two parts – this year we address the conceptual part and \nnext year we hope to present some empirical work based on qualitative or quantitative field work  \nTheories  \n \nThe problem of bilingualism between school and home has already been addressed, namely from \nthe parent’s point of view (Wesely, 2016) and relating to Quebec, in Canada. This is a very good \nexample because it is based in a very affluent country which is not  dislocated. One of the additional \nproblems we believe the students of our sample face is that they are usually dislocated from their \nfamilies and second they may not be able to receive all the support that they could receive in \nQuebec, even if the UK, Spa in and Portugal rank among the developed countries. One interesting \nexperience in this context is the “dual language immersion programs” in the United States, which \nobtain very high marks in what relates to the satisfaction of parents (Olivos and Lucero, 2 018). The \nsame satisfaction with multilingual education has been found for countries such as Ireland \n(Kavanagh, 2014), Brazil (Oliveira and al, 2020), Spain (Freinauer, Whiting, 2014), and the US \nregarding English speaking students (Domer, 2014). These stu dies are very interesting because they \nunderline the importance of bilingualism in students. However , they fall short of the purpose and \nintention of this paper.  \n \nThe problem with try to address in this paper is – what happens when multilingualism is not \naccounted for, and on the contrary, it is completely overshadowed by a legal discourse that in fact \ndenies the existence of the problem itself. Moreover, in the cas es we want to address bilingualism is \nnot even possible because the persons in question are essentially migrants and bilingual studies \nusually is given to locals.  \n \nMethods"

With this \nongoing expansion, it becomes increasingly essential to address the unique barriers and challenges \nimmigrants face. During the transition to a new country, social connectedness emerges as a pivotal \nprotective fac tor (Safdar, Lay, & Struthers, 2003; Yeh & Inose, 2003). Defined as a sense of belonging \nand connection with individuals and social groups, connectedness plays a crucial role in mitigating \nthe negative impacts of stressful life events, contributing signifi cantly to the overall well -being of the \nimmigrant population. It serves as a catalyst for a successful transition to a new host country \n(Safdar, Lay, & Struthers, 2003; Yeh & Inose, 2003).  \n \nConnectedness has been discussed in academic literature by Lee and Robbins (1995) in general \ncontext as a feeling of belonging and the ability to connect with other individuals and social groups. \nBased on this general concept of connectedness, connectednes s can be found in the immigrant \ncontext to provide immigrants with a perceived belonging in the host community which results in \npositive outcomes such as positively effect on mitigating loneliness or isolation issues of immigrants \n(Brance et al., 2022; Pea taw et al., 2023; Safdar et al., 2009). However, within the immigrant context, \nthere remains a lack of clarity regarding the specific type of connectedness experienced by \nimmigrants and the mechanisms through which immigrants establish a sense of connected ness to \nthe host community.  \n \nResearch Purpose & Importance  \n \nRecognizing immigrants as integral members of our community underscores the necessity of \nconsidering their successful transition to the host country, with connectedness playing a key role in \nthis process. Addressing the issue of connectedness within the im migrant community should be a \nfocal point of national human resource development (NHRD). This involves expanding the scope of \nexisting human resource development (HRD) initiatives beyond workplace settings to encompass \ncommunity development (Budhwani & McL ean, 2012). NHRD at the community -societal level aims \nto enhance the quality of life for citizens by promoting networking and community development \n(Garavan et al., 2004). Recognizing the connection between the social integration of immigrants and \ntheir we ll-being in the host country, it becomes crucial to address this matter within the context of \nHRD to demonstrate how it has implications for organizations at the individual, community, and \nsocietal level.  \n \nResearch Question  \n \nThis paper delves into the current literature on connectedness in the immigrant community, aiming \nto broaden our understanding of identified connectedness types, antecedents, and their impact on \noutcomes.  Additionally, we seek to pinpoint necessary HRD su pports to facilitate social \nconnectedness within the immigrant community. Therefore, our research questions are as follows:  \n \nRQ1. What are the antecedents of social connectedness in the immigrant community?  \nRQ2. What are the outcomes of social connectedness in the immigrant community?"

What are the necessary HRD supports to enhance social connectedness in the immigrant \ncommunity?  \n \nMethods  \n \nThe objective of this study is to formulate a comprehensive framework that delves into the factors \ninfluencing connectedness among immigrant populations, along with the associated outcomes. To \nachieve this objective, we conducted an integrative literature review of pertinent literature related \nto connectedness in immigrant communities, as outlined by To rraco (2005). Using the Web of \nScience database and employing synonyms for 'connectedness' and 'immigrants,' our search \ninitially yielded 157 articles. Through a refined selection process, wherein we excluded literature not \nfocused on the immigrant context  or limited to the school context, we included a final set of 39 \narticles in this review.  \n \nPreliminary Results  \n \nThe current integrative literature review reveals three distinct types of connectedness: 1) \nconnectedness to host country residents, 2) connectedness to country of origin communities, and 3) \nmutual connectedness. The first two types involve immigrants feel ing connected to specific groups \nwithout necessarily reciprocated feelings from host country residents. The literature also suggests \nthat connectedness to country of origin communities may positively influence connectedness to \nhost country residents.  \n \nMoreover, antecedents influencing connectedness include individual factors (family status, \nlanguage fluency, living conditions, health, length of stay, pre -knowledge of the host country), \nrelationship -building activities within the immigrant community (par ticipation in community and \nreligious activities), relationship -building activities between host country residents and immigrants \n(sharing food culture, sports events), support from the host country (language programs, local \nevents involving both groups), and external environmental factors (employment rate, discrimination \nclimate).  \n \nExamining the relationship between antecedents and types of connectedness, individual factors \nlead to a sense of connectedness to host country residents or country of origin communities. \nRelationship -building activities within the immigrant community foste r connectedness to both host \ncountry residents and country of origin communities, while programs involving host country \nresidents create mutual connectedness between the two groups. Support from the host country \nleads to connectedness to host country resid ents and mutual connectedness, whereas the external \nenvironment influences connectedness to host country residents.  \n \nAdditionally, the literature reveals two mechanisms of connectedness building based on reactions \nto a new culture: 1) acculturation and 2) enculturation. Highly acculturated individuals value \nconnections to host country communities, while those favoring en culturation prioritize connections \nwithin their cultural group. This preference for enculturation may result in limited connectedness \nwith host country residents and potential negative implications for immigrants.  \nThe outcomes of connectedness for immigrants fall into two main categories: 1) well -being and 2) \ncommunity engagement. Connectedness to host country residents or country of origin communities \npositively influences immigrants' well -being. Support from the h ost country, such as diverse \nworkforce training and frequent communication with immigrant communities by local \ngovernments, moderates this impact. All three types of connectedness contribute to community \nengagement, extending beyond ethnic or home country communities to involve participation in \nlarger community activities and policy -making."

In the product ion phase, providing \nlanguage programs is highlighted, while the synergism phase involves developing connections \nbetween immigrant and host country communities.

Research that interrogates systems of power and privilege, \nand that problematizes assumptions that workplaces (and corre spondingly, Human Resource \nDevelopment research and practice) exist to maximize efficiency and productivity (see Bierema & \nCallahan, 2014) has become increasingly visible in various outlets and publications in the field of \nHRD.  \n \nTheoretical Base  \n \nThis conceptual literature review examines socioeconomic status (SES) and social class as \ndimensions of critical HRD. Gray and Kish -Gephart (2013) explain that socioeconomic status is \nrepresented by income or occupation while social class represents an internalized identity that has \na foundation in one’s resources such as educational attainment, income, and occupational prestige. \nSocial class, or sta tus, reflects someone’s rank when compared to others (Gray & Kish -Gephart).  \n \nResearch Purpose  \n \nThis is a conceptual literature review examining SES and social class research in management, \nleadership, career development, and proximal fields.  Because SES and social class are aspects of \nidentity (see Manstead, 2018), there is fertile ground for a cri tical examination of the ways in which \nSES and class impact career development and leadership development.    \n \nResearch Questions  \n \nThose from lower SES and social class backgrounds have comparatively limited aspects for \nleadership career trajectories (McNamee & Miller, 2009). Therefore, the primary research question \nposed by this working paper is: How can an understanding of the literature regarding the \nrelat ionship between leadership and career development and socioeconomic status and social \nclass, equip HRD practitioners with insights to develop HRD programs to disrupt the asymmetrical \nstructures of career opportunities and possibilities?  \n \nSES and social class represent comparatively under -examined aspects of diversity, equity and \ninclusion and yet they impact (by way of reinforcement) a workplace status quo that is characterized \nby inequity. It has been examined and established that those w ho have higher socioeconomic \nstatus have durable, sustainable advantages with respect to access to education and various forms \nof capital including cultural, educational, financial, social, and career capital (Ingram, 2021). SES and \nsocial class confer pri vileges to some while marginalizing others. In the field of HRD, critical \ninterrogations of power, privilege, marginalization, and oppression have been called out by those \nwho champion a social justice paradigm for HRD (Byrd, 2014).  \n \nMartin et al (2017) posit that traits, psychological orientations, and their learned norms are \ninfluenced by SES and social class, and that growing up in a higher -class status “corresponds to \nhaving more resources at ones’ disposal” (p. 50).

Ethnic \nminorities within Higher Education (HE) constantly experience inequality within the sector despite \nthe introduction of policies to address inequalities (Bhopal, 2021). There is a research gap with \npeoples lived experience  and the extent to which it impacts their progression to Senior Leadership \nposition in UK HE from the lens of critical race theory. The research aims to explore the impact of \nnational and institutional EDI policy's hindrance or improvement to ethnic minori ties' advancement \ninto senior leadership roles in UK universities. The research will provide a theoretical contribution \ntowards developing research in ‘ethnic’ equality and outline implications policymakers and \npractitioners can use to tackle the lack of d iversity in senior leadership roles.  \n \nTheoretical Base  \n \nThe objective of introducing policies is to directly deal with inequalities (Bhopal and Pitkin, 2020). \nHowever, equality policies have been embraced by organisations only because they are bound by \nsuch policy requirements (Ahmed, 2007; Jones, 2006). An obl igation to equality policies sees a \nfailure of organisations to demonstrate an understanding of how to use equality policies to \nappropriately address inequalities. This calls for a greater need for universities to demonstrate an \nunderstanding of equality p olicies and how legal equality measures are being met by the 2010 \nEquality Act (Bhopal, 2019).  \n \nResearch has shown that Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a useful framework to assist with \nunderstanding and addressing issues of inequalities in Higher Education (Ladson -Billings & Tate, \n1995; Decuir & Dixson, 2004). The framework will be drawn on to illumin ate the multifaceted nature \nof the challenges faced by ethnic minorities. A qualitative research design will be employed to \ninclude interviews and document analysis, the research aims to capture the lived experiences of \nethnic minorities and provide rich, context -specific data for analysis (Jenkins, 2014).  \n \nResearch Purpose  \n \nThe primary purpose of this research is to critically examine the effectiveness of existing EDI policies \nin promoting the career advancement of ethnic minorities to senior leadership roles in UK \nuniversities. The study seeks to unravel the underlying mecha nisms that either facilitate or hinder \nprogress and identify areas for improvement in EDI initiatives.  \n \nResearch Questions  \n \n1) To what extent do current EDI policies influence the career progression of ethnic minorities in UK \nuniversities?  \n2) What are the key barriers that ethnic minorities encounter in their pursuit of senior leadership \nroles?"

This approach allows for a framew ork to be developed which provides a \nbroad perspective of the key themes arising in the literature. The domains of HRM and Finance have \nbeen purposefully selected. Both spaces represent different understandings of firm performance. \nWithin HRM literature, f irm performance is generally a subjective measure of success which \ncomprises a range of dimensions, including subjective measures of financial successes and \nefficiency (Mayrhofer et al. 2008).  In contrast, within Finance, firm performance is usually an \nobjective measure denoted by a financial (eg share prices) and/or profit metric. Sels et al. (2006, \np.319) propose that the relationship between HRM and firm performance is a subjective one which \nis often “fuzzy” and contingent upon context and measurement a pproaches. Dundon and Rafferty \n(2018) argue that HRM considers a broad range of stakeholder interests as well as developmental \nobjectives and long -term goals when defining organisational success, and therefore provide a \nholistic and inclusive measure of fi rm performance.  The Dundon and Rafferty (2018)  approach  is \noften perceived as being at odds with ‘value -creation’ and ‘firm performance’ goals from the \nperspective of both scholars and practitioners within finance.  Indeed, tensions have existed \nbetween  HRM professionals and financial personnel for decades. In ‘hyper -masculine environments \nsuch as investment banking this is particularly problematic with HRM perceived as “not meeting the \nchallenges presented by the sector’s environment” (Aldrich & Dietz;.  p8 (XXX); Aldrich & Daniel \n(2019).  \n \nWhen we look to the issue of diversity and inclusion, HRM professionals are often organisational \n‘gatekeepers’ who implement initiatives which promote difference and inclusion amongst \nemployees, presenting them as essential for organisational success. From  a finance perspective, the  \nGlobal Financial Crisis (GFC (2028)) revealed the danger of ‘groupthink’ in relation to risk and \nperformance, and as such, diversity and inclusion initiatives have seen increased levels of attention. \nHowever, for many financial professionals such programmes are perceived as \"nice to have” rather \nthan essential to firm performance.  \n \nThis research will examine how diversity and inclusion is presented in the two bodies of literature – \ndoes a difference exist between the HRM and Finance academic communities? The key aim this \nresearch is to examine whether diversity and inclusion are trea ted as just “another variable” or does \nthe literature contain a more critical orientation of the relationship between firm performance, \ndiversity and inclusion problematized in a more holistic way."

While DM is recognized as a vital strategic \nchoice for organizations globally (Olsen & Martins, 2012), its  development in Italy needs to be more \nstudied, with limited adoption and a predominant focus on female workforce issues (Colella & Di \nLorenzo, 2023). The research builds on prior studies highlighting the need for a contextual \nunderstanding of DM approache s, challenging assumptions about their universal applicability \n(Ravazzani, 2016).  \n \nExamining the gender landscape in Italy, the data unveils a stark contrast between educational \nattainment and professional representation for women in line with the European situation. Despite \nhigher educational achievements, women face lower employment ra tes, widening further with the \nnumber of children (Istat, 2022). Gender pay gaps persist, particularly in managerial roles, \nemphasizing the need for nuanced approaches to address systemic issues (Manello et al., 2023). \nImportantly, a critical mass of women  in top management positively influences firm credit risk and \ninternationalization (Bannò et al., 2019; Manello et al., 2023).  \n \nThe theoretical framework guiding the research combines critical feminism and social \nconstructionism. Critical feminism brings attention to dismantling patriarchal organizational \nstructures, emphasizing reflection on privilege, structural reform for emancipation, increased \ngender consciousness, and the reconstruction of solidarity (Bierema et al., 2022). Social \nconstructionism, rooted in claims -making and  narrative analysis, underscores the contextual and \ninteractive nature of social problems (Spector & Kitsuse, 1977; Tamboukou, 2008).  \nMethodologically, the study employs Narrative Inquiry, focusing on personal narratives to \nunderstand gender equity perceptions in Vicenza organizations. After a preliminary survey \nadministration to organizational employees, narrative inquiry through 15 int erviews with human \nresource managers and/or trade union representatives will explore organizational policies and \npractices promoting gender equity. This effort aims to recognize organizational models used by \nmanufacturing, cooperative, service, trade, tour ism, tertiary, and craft enterprises in Vicenza \n(Veneto Region).  \n \nFurthermore, the research aims to disseminate findings effectively.

      "text": "99 \nID:232  - “Double Empathy and Relational Leadership in Neurodiverse \nWorkplaces”  \nKatherine Kinnaird  & Yoshie Nakamura  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThe purpose of the proposed qualitative study is to investigate the ways in which managers without \nautism spectrum disorder (hereafter “autism”) and their staff with autism in the United States \nexperience empathy in their relationships, such that tradition al definitions of “leader” and “follower” \nblur in favor of relational leadership and two -way forms of understanding. In doing so, it addresses \na gap in neurodiversity research by looking at autism, a specific neurological condition, in the \ncontext of relat ional leadership and offers guidance for developing two -way relationships in support \nof individual and organizational wellness.  \n \nThe first research question looks at the empathy managers without autism and their staff with \nautism display in their work relationships and the second question looks at the dynamics of the \nrelationships themselves.  \n1. How do managers without autism and their employees with autism in the United States \nexhibit empathy towards each other in their work relationships?  \n2. How do managers without autism and their employees with autism in the United States \nunderstand the relationship between their roles in the workplace?  \n \nWhile discussion around neurodiversity in the workplace has increased in recent years (Silver et al., \n2023), the proposed project deeply connects to topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion in Human \nResource Development (HRD) by addressing an ongoing nee d for research about neurodiversity in \nthe context of relational leadership. This research challenges top -down relationships between non -\nautistic managers and their staff with autism in favor of two -directional relationships. Leaders and \nfollowers will beg in “losing their traditional identity that is rooted in the formal organizational \nstructure (manager -subordinate) and become inseparable parts of a co -constructing process of \nleadership” (Psychogios & Dimitriadis, 2021, p.2).  \n \nThe project’s emphasis on neurodiversity in the context of relational leadership reflects “the double \nempathy problem” in practical workplace contexts, in which different social experiences and \nexpectations complicate the ability for people without autism to understand those with autism and \nvice versa (Milton, 2012). The proposed research’s emphasis on double empathy links it to topics of \ninclusion and equity as it explores pathways of neurodiverse communication in the workplace.  \nThe research focuses on this “double empathy” as a vehicle through which leaders and their \nemployees with autism exhibit “relational leadership,” in contrast to the one -way relationships that \nhave prevented non -autistic leaders and autistic followers from understanding each other. It \nrecognizes that people with autism have strengths and weaknesses that overlap and diverge from \nstrengths and weaknesses of those without autism. The extent to which an “individual impairment \nis actually experienced as disabling  and disadvantaging is co -constituted by contextual and \nsituational factors” (Dobusch, 2019, p. 383). There is also an element of inclusivity built into the \nstudy’s definition of relational leadership, as it relates to two -way empathy for each other’s \nexpe riences and needs. This aspect of inclusivity in leadership is “fundamental to relational \nleadership, as it focuses on interpersonal relationships and drives followers' perceptions that \nleaders are fair, accountable, and attentive to their needs” (Northous e, 2022, p. 325)."

      "text": "101 \nID:234  - Social Justice Responsibility: A Concept, a Review, and a Research \nAgenda  \nCiarán McFadden  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nIn this paper, I argue that organisations are increasingly expected to engage in policies and \npractices centred on advancing social justice, both within the organisation and within broader \nsociety, and that this may (and indeed may have) become a standard through which consumers and \npotential employees judge them. A new term, which brings together aspects of EDI and CSR, namely \nSocial Justice Responsibility (SJR), is introduced and conceptualised. The antecedents and \nimplications of SJR are discussed, parti cularly emphasizing the role of the HRD function and \nscholarly field. I argue that this concept and practice should be seen as separate from existing \ncorporate social responsibility and diversity management practices.  \nScholars and activists argue that organisations often fail in a key aspect of their equality, diversity \nand inclusion (EDI) practice, because they focus more on the commercial advantages of diversity \nwhilst failing to adequately address barriers faced by m arginalised groups within their workplace. \nEDI as a practice also often tends to look inward, involving organisational policies and practices that \nsolely affect employees and potential employees. Externally, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) \nand latter ly Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals have become more widespread, but \nare often characterized as highly individualised (Fordham & Robinson, 2018), too broad, a branding \neffort, and/or a way to increase share performance, rather than a genuin e tool for social change.   \nEDI and CSR/ESG are therefore well established, but focus on separate areas; EDI looking inward \nand on the organisation’s micro -environment, CSR/ESG looking outward, often at issues far \nremoved from the lives of employees. But how do social justice movemen ts fit into this dichotomy? \nAfter the murder of George Floyd in 2020, many companies promised to take action to end racial \ninjustice in the workplace and beyond; after #MeToo went viral in 2017, companies pledged to clean \nhouse and eliminate sexual harassm ent in their ranks. However, a CSR/ERG agenda that is overly \nbroad, fuzzy and at the whim of executives, and an EDI approach that focuses solely on internal \npolicies and practices, cannot adequately address rapidly evolving complex social justice \nmovements  which straddle both sides of the organisational boundary.   \n \nIn the past it may have been easier for companies to wait until the dust of these social movements \nsettled, and quietly disregard their promises and resume business as usual. However, Generation Z \nnow makes up 15 -20% of the population in the USA, and have distinct priorities, experiences and \nskills that differentiate them from other generations (e.g., Millennials, Boomers). Fighting for social \njustice is one of the defining features of this group (Seemiller & Grace, 2017; Meehan, 2016), and \norganisations ar e being increasingly expected to take stances on social justice issues, even if it risks \nalienating other groups of consumers (Fromm, 2021). As more and more of Generation Z enter the \nworkforce, however, employer branding is also an issue that companies mu st take seriously. The \n‘war for talent’ (Axelrod, Michaels, & Handfield -Jones, 2001) still rages, and has been exacerbated by \nthe so -called Great Resignation. Engaging in effective practices aimed at address social injustice, \ntherefore, may be a key way to  attract and retain this group of employees.  \n \nSocial Justice Responsibility is characterised here as the third, necessary complement to EDI and \nCSR/ESG. In comparison with the other two components, SJR practices seek to:  \n \n- Acknowledge and bring attention to historical and contemporary social injustices, at the \ninterpersonal, organisation, industry, and societal levels,"

Many scholars have already \nadvocated for a greater commitment to social responsibility with in organisations. Byrd and Hughes \n(2015) argue that the practice of diversity management primarily serves the organisation and its \ngoals, rather than those of the marginalised workforce in the organisation, and advocate for a \n“paradigm shift for diversity management that responds to the social injustices experienced by \nmarginalized employees” (p. 1233). Similarly, Syed and Kramer (2009) argue for “socially responsible \ndiversity management” that places the social justice case for EDI work at the forefront of  initiatives, \nwhile Bierema and D’Abundo (2004) discuss organizational social consciousness, through which \nHRD practitioners can help promote socially responsible practices within the workplace. Collins, \nZhang and Sisco (2021) highlight that there have bee n recent calls to move social justice work from \nthe margins of the organisation towards its center. To complement those calls, one may also call for \norganisations to work together to advance social justice.   \n \nThe HRD practitioner, as custodian of knowledge in organisations, has a vital role to play in SJR. In \nthe same sense that Garavan and McGuire (2010, p. 489) argue that HRD can “raise the awareness \nof employees and develop positive attitudes toward sustaina bility . . . [and] can contribute to the \ndevelopment of a culture that supports sustainability, CSR, and ethics”, HRD can promote the \nimportance of SJR in the organisation – through, for example, providing information about social \njustice issues, develop e mployees’ understanding of the importance of SJR and each individual’s part \nto play within it, and to seek out best practice in other organisations. They can also help set up \nstrategic links with social justice groups and other organisations to facilitate learning and \ndevelopment in areas where employees lack knowledge. As knowledge managers, HRD \npractitioners may also have an important and careful task in managing knowledge exchange \nbetween organisations. Should organisations work together in partnership, there may be \nopportunities for the sharing of knowledge and a synergetic, collaborative improvement in \ndeveloping SJR policies and practices.   \n  \nReferences  \n \nBierema, L.

      "text": "104 \nID:240  - Navigating Misophonic Triggers at Work through Learning  \nMosaab Sabah  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nMisophonia is a condition, first identified in 1997 by audiologist Marsha Johnson, and later named \nby Jasterboff and Jasterboff in 2002, in which individuals experience immediate, intense, and \nnegative responses to auditory stimuli (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023 ). Stimuli often trigger responses \nsuch as irritation, anger, disgust, anxiety and escape (Brout et al., 2018; Swedo et al., 2022). These \ntriggers can have a severely negative impact on social, occupational, and academic functioning \n(Dozier & Mitchell, 202 3).  \n \nDozier & Mitchell (2023) state that misophonia is a poorly known condition due to its recent \ndiscovery. They also posit that there is a lack of consensus on the etiology of misophonia. This \nposition is held by other researchers, such as Guetta et al. (2022 ), Edelstein et al. (2013), and \nCecilione et al. (2022), who state that misophonia is an unexplored, underresearched, and relatively \nnew field of study. Since researchers suggest that the perception and response to triggers is \ninfluenced by the context in which the triggers occur, and over time, they can impair functioning of \nadults in professional, academic and social settings, it is important to understand these triggers in \nthe workplace and their impact on employees with misophonia. Thus, the purpose of this \nconceptual working paper informed by a review of the literature and adult learning theories \n(Merriam & Bierema, 2014) is to present a framework that will guide the study of understanding the \nexperiences of professionals with misophonia in order to rev eal strategies used by these \nprofessionals to respond to misophonic triggers in the workplace. Implications for HRD practice and \nresearch will be presented at the conference.  \n \nReferences  \n \nBrout, J., J., Edelstein, M., Erfanian, M., Mannino, M., Miller, M.

Facilitating critical learning may be \ngrounded in beliefs that adult professional s might transfer critical learning to workplaces through \ncritical action in the organization. Nevertheless, whether critical HRD and management are \npracticed outside academia is questioned (Kwon & Archer, 2023).  \n \nTransferring attitudes, skills, and knowledge learned through education and training to the \nworkplace has long been explored with the concept of “transfer of learning” (ToL), often \ninterchangeably used with “transfer of training.” However, most ToL studies  lack a critical \nperspective. This omission might be irrelevant with traditional HRD and management research and \neducation that (re)produce performance, profit, and production -oriented values, practices, and \nsystems. In contrast to traditional learning, cr itical learning embraces criticality —the state of being \ncritical —in learning and challenges injustice, inequity, domination, and oppression (Bierema et al., \n2024; Trehan and Rigg, 2015). Critical learning requires creating shared knowledge and \nunderstandin g related to social and political contexts based on critical and mutual dialogue in a \nlearning community (Armitage, 2010; Valentin, 2007). Thus, the factors impacting the transfer of \nnon-critical learning may differ from those of critical learning.  \n \nAnother gap in ToL research is associated with the learning/training context. Extant research on ToL \nmight be challenging to understand learning transferred in different organizations (i.e., university \nclassrooms - work practices), given that most studies on ToL investigated learning transferred in the \nsame organization (i.e., training programs offered by the workplace —work practices). Further, most \nToL studies focus on face -to-face learning, even though virtual learning has grown. A new approach \nto examini ng adults' \"critical\" learning in HRD and management classrooms in a digital age could be \ntransferred into the workplace is needed.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nThis paper aims to introduce transfer of critical learning (ToCL) as a learning purpose of critical HRD \nand management education.  \n \nResearch Questions  \n• How might ToCL be defined and assessed?  \n• Which factors might influence ToCL?  \n• How might ToCL be studied and practiced in a digital age?  \n \nTheoretical Basis  \nToL and critical HRD and management education compose the study’s theoretical background.  \n \n4.1.

History and research trends of ToL  \nLearning is considered transferred when adult learners apply information, strategies, and skills they \nhave learned (e.g., in the classroom) to a new situation or context (e.g., in the organization). Early \nToL tested and maximized training effectiveness. Th orndike and Woodworth (1901) initially \nsuggested the notion of ToL, although originally described it as transfer of practice. They posited \nToL depends on similarity between the function trained (e.g., learning contexts and tasks) and \nfunctions tested (e.g. , practice/transfer contexts where learners should apply what they have \nlearned).  \n \nRecent ToL studies employed diverse research methods, including longitudinal study and network \nanalysis (e.g., Deckers et al., 2022; Van den Bossche et al., 2010; Van den Bossche and Segers, 2013; \nWagstaff et al., 2022). Also, ToL research in e -learning se ttings has grown (e.g., Blume et al., 2023; \nFauth et al., 2023; Park and Wentling, 2007; Testers et al., 2020).  \n \n4.1.2. Factors impacting ToL  \nToL has been explored in adult education, work, and organization studies to enhance training \neffectiveness and bridge the gap between learning and transfer (Davis et al., 2013; Illeris, 2009; \nPhilpott, 2007). Mainly using quantitative research methods, res earch has identified factors \nimproving ToL (e.g., Blume et al., 2010, 2023; Cheng and Ho, 2001; Huang et al., 2015; Gegenfurtner \net al., 2016; Grossman and Salas, 2011; Sudebi, 2004). Research includes individual (e.g., motivation \nand attitudes, personalit ies, abilities and skills, perceptions), relational (e.g., supervisory behaviors, \npeer supports, social and family supports, team characteristics), workplace environment (e.g., \norganizational climate and culture, post -training transfer environments), and l earning/training \nenvironments (e.g., pre -training settings, training design, training delivery methods, and training \ncontent characteristics)  \n \nTo find the factor associated with transfer of learning, studies have used some scales, including \nlearning transfer system inventory (LTSI) measuring factors in the system affecting transfer of \nlearning developed by Holton and colleagues (e.g., Bates et al ., 2012; Holton et al., 2000, 2003), \ntransfer interest questionnaire measuring trainee interest introduced by Gegenfurtner et al. (2020), \nand the unified model of task ‐specific motivation questionnaire (De Brabander and Glastra, 2018, \n2021; De Jong et al., 2023).  \n \n4.2. Critical HRD and Management Education  \nCritical HRD and management education teaches adult professionals about HRD and management \nfrom a critical perspective and discusses diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice issues at work \n(e.g., Armitage, 2010; Byrd and Scott, 2018; Collins, 2013,  2017; Gold and Bratton, 2014; Lawless et \nal., 2012; Lo, 2023; Rabelo et al., 2023; Sim and Bierema, 2023; Thomas et al., 2010). Critical HRD and \nmanagement educators mindfully use critical pedagogy, including feminist, anti -racist, and \nintersectional peda gogy), to raise adult learners’ critical, intersectional consciousness and facilitate \nlearners to change the oppressive organizations, not the oppressed employees (Sim & Bierema, \n2023).  \n \nImplications for HRD  \nAs a conceptual paper exploring ToL from a critical perspective, this study would contribute to \ncritical HRD and management education practices and studies.

It has been proven \nin the literature that BRM can leverage project implementation to achieve  the benefits defined by \nthe organizations across various sectors of activity. In the same way, it has also been observed \nwhich Critical Success Factors (CSF) can enable a successful project implementation in the public \nsector.  \n \nIt is important to highlight that project management plays a crucial role in achieving the \norganization's strategy, and consequently moving from a position “as is” to “to be”, while creating \nvalue for the organization and its stakeholders. The public secto r plays an even more important role \nsince the ultimate goal of projects in this sector is the creation of Public Value, e.g., value for society \nand the improvement of the citizens lives.  \n \nNevertheless, the literature shows us that for most organizations it is still a challenge to harvest the \nbenefits from the projects implemented, compromising the creation of value for its stakeholders, \neven more so in the public sector due to its complexit y.  \nAlthough the topics above have been thoroughly investigated, it’s still not clear how can we exploit \nthe BRM practices (and which are the main CSFs) in the public sector project management for the \ncreation of value for the citizens.  \n \nTherefore, we consider pertinent to inquire about which practices can leverage the implementation \nof projects in the public sector to add value for the citizens under the project management and BRM \nscope.  \n \nOur aim for the doctoral program is to deepen the CSFs in the implementation of the Project \nManagement and BRM practices in this sector to have a citizen -centric approach and, consequently, \nnot only achieve the benefits intended at the beginning of the project but also create value. Thus, \nour research aims to answer the following question: which are the critical success factors in project \nmanagement  in the Portuguese public sector for the creation of citizen value?  \nThis paper constitutes our first step going forward in order to find some leads in our investigation. \nWe summarize the literature main findings that we believe can inform and allow us to narrow our \nresearch. Additionally, it presents some of the main gaps we found in this field of study. Once we \nconclude our investigation, we aspire to add value in the field of Benefits Realization Management \nand Project management practices in the public sector, as well as contribute with recommendations \nfor practitioners.  \n \nKeywords : Benefits Realization Management, Project Management, Public Sector, Value Creation, \nCitizen -Centricity"

On \none hand, there is research emphasizing AI as a supportive tool that enhances leadership \ncapabilities, focusing on the necessity for leaders to adapt and develop skills such as agility, \ncontinuous learning, and ethical understanding in the AI era. It views AI more as a co -pilot in \ndecision -making, highlighting the  importance of human elements in leadership (Watson et al., \n2021). Contrastingly, on the other hand, Quaquebeke and Gerpott (2023) discuss a more \ntransformative role of AI in leadership. They outline a future where AI could potentially substitute \nhuman lea dership functions, raising ethical questions and the potential for AI to cater to employees' \nneeds better than human leaders. Thus, it is worth exploring how such AI systems can be designed \nand utilized to not only support but also enhance inclusivity in l eadership roles.  \n \nGiven the complex interplay of intersectional social identities and the related social norms, values, \nand beliefs (re)produced by discursive practices, the key challenge is to ensure that generative AI \naids in acknowledging and addressing these organizatio nal phenomena. Applied as a co -pilot, AI has \ngreat potential to transform organizational strategy and influence leader behaviour and also to \nimpact skills and competencies contemporary leaders need for effective leadership (Watson et al., \n2021). This resea rch problem centers on investigating how generative AI can be tailored and \nemployed to support inclusive leadership development, ensuring it recognizes and mitigates biases, \nrespects diversity, and promotes equity (see Birhane 2022), thereby contributing t o the creation of \nmore inclusive organizational cultures.  \n \nOur proposed research question is: How can generative AI, as a developmental tool for leaders, \naddress inclusivity issues inherent in its design and application? Employing discourse analysis, our \nstudy scrutinizes the dialogues and interactions between pro grammers, leaders, and AI systems, \naiming to identify and address biases and inclusivity gaps in the AI's programming and \nrecommendations, align with the findings of Newstead, Eager and Wilson (2023), who highlight the \nimportance of examining AI -generated content for biases, and the need for leaders and AI \nprogrammers to be aware of and address these biases.  \n \nOur focus is on understanding the intricate interplay between the ethical framework guiding \ngenerative AI development, the personal beliefs of the programmers creating these AI systems, and \nthe inclusivity perspectives of the leaders who utilize this AI co -pilot. The study's future findings aim \nto offer insights into the transformative potential of AI in shaping inclusive leadership dynamics.  \n \nReferences  \n \nBirhane, A. (2022).

The continuous insertion of knowledge and \nskills into the public sector's Human Capital not only improves in dividual effectiveness, but is also \nreflected in the overall capacity of the government apparatus to meet social demands.  \nThe convergence of the Digital Age and ICT enables public administration to integrate advanced \nknowledge management systems, data analysis and process automation, resulting in an operational \nsynergy that strengthens Human Capital. The ability to process an d analyze large volumes of data \nprovides valuable insights for informed decision -making, while the automation of routine tasks \nfrees up professionals to focus on more strategic and complex activities.  \n \nWithin this technical perspective, the Digital Age and ICT are presented as facilitators for the \noptimization of Human Capital, allowing for the customization of training and development \nprograms, aligned with the specific demands of public administration.  This strategic approach not \nonly meets the individual needs of civil servants, but also contributes to more efficient and \nadaptable management.  \n \nIn the context of this article, the distinction between public and private assets is central to the \nanalysis of resource management. Public goods, characterized by non -rivalry and non -exclusion, \nrequire a specific approach to resource allocation. The use o f technology in human resource \nmanagement enables a better understanding of collective needs, allowing for the efficient allocation \nof resources to meet society's demands.  \n \nThe Laffer curve, in turn, highlights the relationship between the tax burden and tax revenue. \nTechnology plays a crucial role in optimizing tax collection and identifying ideal tax points, avoiding \nthe overload that can lead to a drop in revenue. This promotes more efficient tax management, \nensuring that the resources collec ted are used strategically to benefit society.  \nThe utilitarian perspective in public management seeks to maximize utility for as many citizens as \npossible. By providing accurate data and metrics, technology allows public managers to identify \npriority areas and allocate resources in a way that maximizes  social welfare. In this way, informed \ndecision -making driven by technology contributes to the realization of utilitarian principles in public \nadministration."

In the context of human resource \nmanagement, technology can be applied to ensure that repetitive and bure aucratic tasks are \nautomated, freeing up professionals to focus on more strategic and value -added activities. This \nreflects the conceptual nature of the principle of diminishing marginal utility, where efficiency is \nmaximized by directing resources towards  more productive activities.  \n \nA practical example of this improvement in the performance of human resources in public \nadministration can be seen in the implementation of personnel management systems based on \nartificial intelligence. These systems can analyze large data sets to identify  performance patterns, \nallowing for more efficient allocation of personnel. Furthermore, by automating recruitment, \ntraining and performance evaluation processes, these systems reduce the bureaucratic burden on \nemployees, allowing them to focus on more str ategic tasks.  \n \nBy incorporating information and communication technologies, the public administration can \nimprove the effectiveness of training programs, customizing them based on the individual needs of \nemployees. This not only increases the satisfaction and engagement of civil servants, but also \ncontributes to a more efficient and productive working environment.  \n \nThe concept of Human Capital gains even more relevance in the context of human resources \nmanagement in the Public Administration, especially when integrated with information and \ncommunication technologies. When considering the importance of Human Capital i n public \nadministration, it is crucial to recognize that civil servants play a fundamental role in providing \nservices and implementing policies. Valuing and developing these human resources is essential to \nensuring an effective government that is responsiv e to society's needs.  \n \nContinuous training, supported by information and communication technologies, allows for the \ndevelopment of Human Capital, ensuring that civil servants are up to date with the skills needed to \nguarantee ever greater utility from the scarce public resources  at their disposal.  \nIndeed, the efficient management of Human Capital in Public Administration resonates with the \nprinciples of utilitarianism, maximizing utility for society. Better trained public sector human \nresources, supported by appropriate technologies, are better equi pped to understand the needs of \nthe community and apply the public resources at their disposal more effectively, thus aligning with \nthe objectives of public utility.  \n \nIn the context of this article, the Principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility makes it possible to blur \nthe subjective dimension of the utility that is generated from decisions made in the sphere of Public \nAdministration.  \n \nIn terms of diminishing marginal utility, the automation of routine processes frees up human \nresources for tasks that require specific skills, creativity and decision -making. This strategic \nreallocation of resources reflects not only operational efficiency , but also the practical application of \nthe principle of diminishing marginal utility in human resource management.  \nThus, the integration of knowledge into the Public Administration's Human Capital, enhanced by the \nDigital Age and ICT, emerges as a critical factor in maximizing the utility of public resources.  \n \nKeywords:  Human Resources; diminishing marginal utility; Public Administration; Information and \nCommunications Technologies; efficiency."

Tenure -track faculty members, including those in research -intensive universities, face \nthe daunting task of teaching and mentoring students, providing professional services, and \nmaintaining or improving research productivity. These responsibilities can take a toll on faculty \nmembers, leading to severe stress and  burnout. In fact, a 2020 survey of over 1,000 faculty \nmembers found that 69% of them reported being extremely stressed (The Chronicle of Higher \nEducation, 2020).  \n  \nGiven the pressing issues facing academia, there has been growing interest in improving faculty job \nsatisfaction. However, most empirical studies on this topic have overlooked the department -level \neffects (e.g., Alonderiene and Majauskaite, 2016; Bozeman a nd Gaughan, 2011; Heyliger and \nHeyliger, 2014; Worthy et al., 2020), despite the fact that faculty members are nested within \ndepartments, each with its own unique atmosphere, policies, people, and culture.  \n \nResearch purpose    \n \nThe primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a faculty job satisfaction model, \nwhich considers the influence of individual differences and departmental context on the overall job \nsatisfaction of faculty members.  \n \nResearch questions  \n \n3.1.To what extent do individual -level hygiene factors (such as equitable work distribution) and \ndepartmental -level hygiene factors (such as departmental collegiality and ineffective leadership of \ndepartment head or dean) impact faculty's job satisfaction?   \n \n3.2.How are hygiene factors at the individual and departmental levels interrelated in explaining \nfaculty job satisfaction?  \n \nTheoretical basis  \n \nUsing organizational justice theory (Greenberg, 1987) and the two -factor theory of motivation \n(Herzberg et al., 1959), this study aims to explain faculty job satisfaction. The two -factor theory \nexplains that motivation and hygiene factors lead to job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Motivation \nfactors (e.g., achievement, autonomy, growth, responsibility) improve job satisfaction by meeting \nesteem and self -actualization needs. On the other hand, hygiene factors (e.g., relatio nships, salary, \nwork conditions, job security) cause job dissatisfaction by not meeting physiological, safety, and love \nand belongingness needs. Hagedorn (2000) presented a faculty job satisfaction model based on the \ntwo-factor theory, which also considers  demographic and environmental factors (e.g., gender, race, \nage, tenure, department) that impact job satisfaction. Empirical studies have found that hygiene \nfactors have a greater impact on faculty job satisfaction than motivation factors. Collaboration \nopportunities and interpersonal relationships increase job satisfaction, while ineffective leadership \nstyles, such as passive/avoidant leadership, decrease it."

      "text": "116 \nOrganizational justice theory, which draws on equity theory, is another useful framework for \nexploring faculty job satisfaction (Greenberg, 1987). This theory includes several components, such \nas (a) distributive justice, which examines how resources and o utcomes (such as compensation and \npay) are distributed fairly, (b) procedural justice, which looks at how organizational processes (such \nas decision -making) are conducted in a fair manner, and (c) interactional justice, which examines \nhow employees are tre ated equitably. Research has found that employees' perception of \norganizational justice is positively associated with motivation and overall job satisfaction (Al -Zu’bi, \n2010; Latham and Pinder, 2005).  \n \nHypothesis 1.

(PwC’s hopes & fears, 2023). The digital revolution is \nradically transforming the Thai workforce. Four distinct generations work side -by-side, each with \nunique styles, behaviors, and varying degrees of digital fluency. This presents an immense \nopportunity for innovation, agility, and a pressing c hallenge: bridging the digital generation gap. \nWhile digital tools connect like never before, they also amplify communication discrepancies.  \nLeaders no longer simply manage; they must bridge the digital divide, foster collaboration, and \nunlock the full po tential of their multigenerational teams. Existing frameworks lack the precision \nand depth needed to navigate the complex digital landscapes of a multigenerational workforce.  \nTheoretical based – Guiding by the lens of generational behavior and characteristics, digital fluency \nand generation -specific online behaviors, leadership theories and models (Bass, 1985; Hersey and \nBlanchard, 1969; Pearce & Conger, 2003, etc.), and commun ication competency (Spitzberg & \nCupach, 1984) to explore the communication competency framework of leadership in the Thai \nmulti -generational workforce.  \n \nResearch purpose  \n \nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the theoretical framework of communication competency \nfor leaders, clarifying the significance of a leadership style for managing multigenerational \nworkplaces from the viewpoints of both leaders and employees. Ad ditionally, in Thai \nmultigenerational workplaces in the digital age, the elements crucial to developing a leader's \ncommunication ability will be explored.  \n \nResearch questions  \n \nThree research questions will be addressed: i) What are the leadership styles to lead the multi -\ngeneration workplaces in the Thai digital era? ii) What are the important leaders’ communication \ncompetencies in multi -generation workplaces based on the leader ’s and the employee’s \nperspectives? iii) What are the factors that are important to create the leader's communication \ncompetency of Thai multi -generation workplaces in the digital era? To address the research \nquestions, qualitative research was employed.

While these benefits \narguably provide female employees with viable options that will allow them to establish a career \nfoothold without the conflicting pressures associated with family planning and career development \n(De Proost and Coene, 2 022; Murugesu et al., 2023), there are significant downside risks that have \nfailed to gain traction in the wider academic literature (Kolata, 2022). Elective egg freezing, \ntherefore, may hold the key to leveling the corporate playing field affording talent ed female \nemployees time to establish their careers unencumbered by their reproductive biological timescales \nbut could also mark an inflection point in where the line between the firm and its employees’ family -\nbuilding plans is at best blurred, at worse, i ntrusive.  \n \nOne could conclude that these talent management and development strategies are remarkably \nprogressive. An alternative narrative, however, might contend that they are little more than an \nattempt by organizations to hide work intensification, productivity, and delayed family planning in \nthe guise of female empowerment and career develo pment (Birenbaum -Carmeli, 2023; Bryant, \n2023; Hammond, 2023). A more objective position might be that employers are offering an \n‘individual solution to structural problems’ (Myers and Martin, 2021, p. 17). This raises an important \nquestion: Are fertility t reatments such as egg freezing benefits an innovative female employee perk \nor ethical and moral nightmare? More importantly, given that talent management strategies are \nprimarily interested in acquiring talent, will HRD professionals be left holding the pr overbial and \nliteral baby if things go sideways with the firm’s ‘egg freezing’ benefit strategy? We simply don’t \nknow the answer to that question and may not for many years.  \n \nTheoretical Approach  \n \nWe propose, given the nature of firm’s offering ‘egg freezing’ benefits, a traditional social exchange \nperspective may not be applicable. Therefore, we argue that gift exchange / unconditional gift \nexchange theory (Fremeaux and Michelson, 2011; Akerlof, 1982) might provide a useful theoretical \nlens with whic h to understand the potential ethical and moral implications associated with firm’s \noffering ‘egg freezing’ as an employee attraction and development strategy when there is an implicit \nobligation on those availing of ‘egg freezing’ benefits to reciprocate in kind.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \n \nThe purpose of this research is twofold. First, to date, there have been no empirical studies seeking \nto understand the longer -term career development goals of women electing to join firms offering \n‘egg freezing’ benefits over firms that do not. Therefore,  we aim to position this paper as an \nopportunity to initiate a more critical debate on the use of fertility treatments as a talent \nmanagement attraction and development strategy. Second, there have been no studies to date that \nhave sought to understand the  role of HRD professionals tasked with the long -term development of \nhigh potential females that might avail of ‘egg freezing’ benefits.

For example, are the firm’s \ntalent attraction strategies integrated with the career devel opment strategies of the firm?

In these challenging times, HRD should be deeply concerned with and \ncommitted to sex/gender equity. This includes relevant and inclusive learning and development \nopportunities; however, sex/gender continues to be neglected in training theory and practice. This \nwork ing paper discusses a case study research aimed at changing the current neglect of sex/ \ngender, and other social categories of difference and marginalisation, such as race and disability, in \ntraining practice. The research explored whether learner survey q uestions that specifically focus on \nthe diversity, equity, inclusiveness and belonging (DEIB) of training, provide the insights and \nincentives to recognise and address inequity in training.  \n \nTheoretical framework  \n \nThe theoretical framework for this research was critical socioculturalism. With a critical sociocultural \nlens, training can be analysed as an integral part of organisations marked by inequities based on \ngender, race and other social categories. In addition, the author’s research and theory on how \nsex/gender -blind employee training strengthens current inequities, guided this research.  \n \nResearch purpose  \n \nDEIB of training and learning is typically not evaluated or measured as part of learner surveys. By \nincluding questions about the DEIB of a training, DEIB becomes a deliverable for training providers, \nand it enables the collection of actionable insights on  how to improve the DEIB of training. For this \npurpose, a set of DEIB learner survey questions was developed. These questions were first shared \nwith a panel of academic and professional L&D/ HRD thought leaders. Subsequently a case study \nwas conducted, aim ed at piloting and validating the questions.  \n \nResearch methodology  \n \nThis qualitative case study research was conducted at a multinational corporation with three \nembedded units of analysis (three global training programmes). Data was collected using think -\naloud interviews, inviting interested learners to speak out loud whil e answering the survey \nquestions, with the aim to understand how the questions and answer options were interpreted, \nhow participants arrived at their answers and the completeness of the answer options. Data \nanalysis included coding the interviews on experi ences with the DEIB of training, the interpretation \nand validity of the survey questions, as well as opportunities for improvement.  \n \nResearch questions  \n \n• How do the DEIB survey questions help to understand the level of DEIB of a training?  \n• What can be improved in the questions (clarity, relevance, completeness)?  \n• How did the learners experience the DEIB of the researched training programs, and are \nthere opportunities for improvement?"

Existing studies showed that Muslim women are denied \nemployment opportunities (Allison, 2023), pay increase (Abdelhadi, 2019), and wor kplace \npromotions (Karahan & Tugsuz, 2021) compared to their non -Muslim counterparts. Scholars \nhighlights faith -based discrimination and religious stereotypes as impeding factors to Muslim \nwomen career development. Despite the critical importance of the to pic, no current study has \nexplored the experience of Muslim professional women in the west from a human resource \ndevelopment perspective. Addressing this gap is important to understand the challenges and \nsuggest effective HRD and leadership practices to he lp improve Muslim women professional \nexperience.  \n \nTheoretical base  \n \nMuslim women have captured the attention of scholars, intellectuals, and activists worldwide, \naddressing issues such as discrimination, family patriarchy, dress codes, and lack of representation \nin the workplace. Prevailing narratives repeatedly describe Muslim women in the west as \noppr essed, submissive, and weak (Ali et al., 2017). Those narratives often lead to conclusions that \nindividualize the Muslim women marginalization from the workplace to religious or individual \nreasons. In order to explain the challenges faced by Muslim women i n the western -based \nworkplace, I use a multi -level analysis including individual (micro), organizational (meso), and \nnational, societal, and cultural (Macro) level factors.  \n \nResearch purpose  \n \nIn this study, I will conduct a systematic literature review and synthesis of empirical studies \nexploring the career experiences of Muslim professional women in the western context. Ali et al. \n(2017) defined the western world as including all cultures that  are derived from and influenced by \nEuropean cultures. Europe, Americas, South Africa, and Oceania, together constitute western \nsociety.  \n \nResearch questions  \n \nThree central questions are guiding this review:  \n \n1. What theoretical perspectives have informed the empirical studies of Muslim professional \nwomen's careers?  \n2. What methodological approaches have been used to explore Muslim professional women's \ncareer experiences?  \n3. What characterizes Muslim professional women's career experiences in terms of \nopportunities and challenges?"

Yet, immigrants representing 10.4% to 21% of G7 populations between 2017 and \n2019 (OECD, 2022) have unemployment rates ranging from 25.3% to 41.9% (OECD, 2020b).  Reasons \nfor this incl ude a lack of language proficiency (Bélanger and Vézina, 2017; Townsend, Pascal and \nDelves, 2014), the non -recognition of education credentials (Walton -Roberts, 2005) and a lack of \nprofessional networks (Dalla, Ellis and Cramer, 2005; Hakak and Holzinger, 2010; Krahn, Derwing \nand Abu -Laban, 2005; Sherell, Hundman and Preniqi, 2005; Walton -Roberts, 2005).  Moreover, \nemployers in less popular immigrant destinations are grappling with additional immigrant \nattraction challenges such as local economic conditions  (Miraftab and McConnell, 2008, Walton -\nRoberts, 2005), providing integration services and community amenities (Bonikowska, Hou and \nPicot, 2017; Brown, 2017; Carter, Morrish and Amoyaw 2008; Williams, Kitchen and Randall, 2015; \nTeixeira and Drolet, 2018) an d building social networks (Collantes et al., 2014; Sapeha, 2015; Echref -\nOuédraogo, 2012).  These challenges may be addressed through companies’ onboarding programs, \nthe policies and procedures used to recruit and train new employees (Feldman, 1976; Van Ma anen \nand Schein, 1979).  However, there is a gap in the literature concerning the onboarding of \nimmigrants in less popular immigrant destinations.      \n \nThis study investigates the onboarding of immigrants in four Canadian companies in less popular \nimmigrant destinations and their perceived efficacy from the perspectives of executives, managers, \nnon-immigrant and immigrant workers.  It reveals similarities  and discontinuities between the two \nand helps develop a grounded model for onboarding immigrant workers with potential implications \nfor how digital means may streamline the process.  \n \nThe study answers five research questions:  \n1. What strategies do employers use to onboard immigrants in less popular immigrant \ndestinations?  \n2. What are the perceived challenges of onboarding immigrants?   \n3. How do they see immigrants as meeting their labour needs and what drives this vision?  \n4. What are employers' additional support needs?  \n5. What are immigrants’ onboarding experiences?  \n \nFraming this study is situated learning theory (Lave and Wenger, 2011), and systems theory from a \nHuman Resource Development perspective (Weinberger, 1998), which requires multiple \nperspectives from within and across organizations to understand the whole.  Data consisted of: i) \nqualitative hermeneutical phenomenological interviews with six to eight employees, for a total of \n28, across four companies, ii) company onboarding and community integration service artefacts, \nand iii) field notes taken during visits  to the companies and communities."

The lifestyle has changed through the years of digital transformation and the new \nnormal led by the global pandemic. Likewise, the way working peop le interpret happiness at work, \nquality of work -life, and well -being has changed too. This research studied the definitions of \norganization well -being and how it is interpreted by working people in Thailand, as a starting point \nfor broadening the concept o f organization well -being, from personal happiness to a more holistic \norganization -related concept. Efforts should span from individual level, process level, to \norganization level. Changes should be facilitated considering organization strategy, structure,  \nsystem design, process management, as well as employee well -being and satisfaction.  \nThis research builds on the work of Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) which investigated \ndefinitions of organization well -being in the new normal era, using an integrative literature review. \nThis extended study explored the concept by collecting empir ical data using the qualitative method \nto explore insight into definitions of organization well -being in the context of Thailand, especially in \nthe new normal era.  \n \nData were collected by interviewing practitioners that represent 20 organizations in Thailand from \ndifferent industries, known to have supporting functions and policies for employee well -being. The \nsemi -structured interviews were operated to collect data f rom participants, with probing questions \nasked when there were issues other than those from the main questions. Data analysis was \nconducted using the theory -based coding method (Ruona, 2005). The data derived from the \ndefinitions of organization well -being  from the participants was used as the starting point. It was \nalso coded based on the framework of Rummler and Brache’s (2013) Nine Cells.  \n \nThe concept of organization well -being in Thailand has been related to the Thai Health Foundation’s \nconcept of happy workplaces or the Happy 8, as well as the concept of healthy organization. \nTherefore, literature relating to the two concepts —a happy workp lace and a healthy organization \nwere reviewed. It was noticed that the two concepts relate to the organization well -being, yet not \nsimilar.  \n  \nSritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) found that for an organization to achieve its well -being, it \nneeds to design and manage processes and jobs to meet the desirable goals at every level. Their \nfindings fit with the Nine Cells concept. Therefore, in this  paper, another part of the literature review \nis dedicated to the concept of Nine Cells organization diagnosis, which would be used as a \nfoundation of data interpretation.  \n \nThe findings were discussed alongside the previous study of Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) \nthat examined the definitions based on the Nine Cell framework as well as used to fulfillment the \nconcept of Happy 8 from the ThaiHealth organization. The re sults from this empirical qualitative \nresearch provided a wider and deeper elaboration of Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham’s (2023) \nelements of organization well -being. Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) identified thirty -six \nperformance variables, acco rding to the term used in the Nine Cells concept, that emerged from the \nanalysis of a good number of peer -reviewed sources. After qualitative data collection and \ninterpretation, a total of thirty -nine performance variables were found, along with an elabora tion of \nthe existing performance variables."

      "text": "130 \nBased on this qualitative study, it was found that organization well -being in the new normal era \nextends to both the physical and mental health of employees. This includes employees' work -life \nbalance and employee engagement. To enhance well -being, organiz ations need to redesign \nsystems/policies, restructure organizations well and allocate workforces to better serve the \nchanging operational situations. After all, employees themselves need to be aware of ‘why’ and \n‘how’ they are required to keep themselves f it and healthy.  \n \nThe organization's policies and regulations should be revisited to allow the redesign of either goals, \nprocesses, or management approaches that nurture the well -being of employees. Clear processes \nshould be put in place by adhering to principles relating t o considering the well -being of health and \nwork designed for them to have freedom in decision -making and be able to self -develop. In \naddition, appropriate physical working environments should be prepared for multi -platforms. \nPositive relationships at work across hierarchical levels should be ensured. Key take -away from the \npreviously mentioned findings for HR practitioners is that organizational well -being is born out of \nnurturing, not by nature. It is a part of the results of HR and OD practices, with clea r objectives to \nnurture organizational well -being. Moreover, the findings here can be interpreted that to nurture \norganizational well -being, practitioners need to work on HR and OD processes, not to only create \nactivities. Having employee satisfaction -related activities is nice, yet not enough. The systematic \nprocesses are vital.  \n \nApparently, the results show that the definitions of organization well -being that emerged from this \nqualitative research resembled the one based on the integrative literature review presented by \nSritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023). In addition, this res earch discovered that employee \nengagement plays an important part in an organization's well -being.  \nIt is also worth noting that employee engagement in this case extends to the ex -employees too. \nSpecifically, the policies that were open for former employees to return to work with the \norganization were highlighted. HR policies in accordance with enabling such engagement were \nmentioned significantly as well. In addition to work -based competencies, recruitment, and selection \nshould be redesigned and established to seek people who have personal goals that align with those \nof the organization. The redesigned p olicy needed to be inclusive and embrace diversity issues; \nthese would lead to the design work process that supports employees with diverse needs. The \nfreedom to choose whether to work remotely or in a hybrid manner, job design that can ensure \ntransparency  and fairness at work, and collective work environment were mentioned as the reason \nfor work -based well -being.  \n \nThis study elaborates on how Thai employees contemplate well -being at a multi -organizational \nlevel. Using the Nine -cell framework, the paper reveals how leaders can rethink and redesign the \norganizational system, policies, and structure to facilitate the t ransition of well -being in a new \nnormal era. The prior concept regarding a happy workplace that had been predominantly \nestablished in Thailand was found to be rather short of the job -based dimension. It is worth noting \nthat the results of this qualitative data interpretation demonstrated alignment with the results of \nthe research based on an integrative literature review previously studied by Sritanyarat and \nPruetipibultham (2023). The combined study is determined to be used for future organization well -\nbeing diagnosis tool development to enhance the understanding of organization well -being and \nhappy workplace in Thailand. Based on the present study, individuals, academia, and practitioners \nwho are interested in driving organization well -being may study thes e preliminary results and use \nthem as a guideline or lesson to apply for their further work designs, future research questions, or \nescalating the issue for a better and concrete development.  \n \nKeywords:  organization well -being, individual well -being, new normal, definition, nine -cell \nframework, happy workplace"

These phenomena have been affecting both \ndeveloped and emerging markets and staff retention is now an action pr iority for practitioners (dwif \nconsulting 2022; Salama et al. 2022). The shortage of qualified labour has already caused noticeable \neconomic damage in some regions (Müggler, Liechti and Schärrer 2022). In Northern Germany, \ntourism constitutes a key industr y with a wide range of other sectors depending on it (SGVSH 2020); \nas the region, particularly its rural and remote areas, is facing developmental marginalization \n(Siedentop and Stroms 2021; Wolf 2016), stabilizing the industry is an important task.  \n \nTheoretical base  \nThis research takes the position of Rousseau (1989) that the Psychological Contract is to be defined \nas a unilateral set of beliefs and expectations. Thus, the current project focuses exclusively on the \nsubjective, intra -personal view on the Psychological Contract and aims to establish an \nunderstanding of the nature of Psychological Contracts among hotel employees in the region. The \nrole of the Psychological Contract in employee retention has been recognized and received \nacademic attention in recent years ( Holland and Scullion 2021; Shanker Chaubey 2016; Snyman \n2022; Tabassum and Ghosh 2023).   \n \nResearch Purpose and Method  \n \nThis study seeks answers to the following questions:  \n• What shared viewpoints exist among frontline hotel employees in Northern Germany about \nthe employer inducements expected in their Psychological Contract?  \n• Which inducements are equally valued by employees?  \n• On the importance of which inducements do viewpoints differ?  \n• What demographic and workplace characteristics are associated with the different \nviewpoints?  \n \nWe have adopted Q Methodology to enable us to determine the variety of viewpoints which may \nexist among different demographics and across the diverse landscape of workplaces.  In this \nworking paper we present the set of subjective statements reflecting exp ectations on employer \ninducements which may be formed by employees and potentially our initial findings from the Q \nsort. The statement concourse was accessed by reviewing 141 job postings published on a popular \njob search portal for hospitality professiona ls (Hotelcareer. 2023) in September 2023 as well as \ncorporate career websites of hotel companies active in Northern Germany. Analysis revealed a \nconcourse of explicitly and implicitly promised inducements from which 97 initial statements in 20 \ncategories w ere derived. These were reduced to 49 statements in 13 themes, phrased from a first -\nperson perspective.

HRD and engagement in later -\ncareer to extend working lives  \n \nKate Black, Russell Warhurst  & Claire Hedley  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nImportance of the paper  \n \nDespite significant digital developments and the robotisation of certain work, the Western world is \nexperiencing significant skills and labour shortages (House of Commons, 2023).  Such shortages can \nbe attributed, at least in part, to the disengagement and departure of skilled later -carer workers \nfrom the workforce (CBI, 2022).  In efforts to stem this loss, age -equalities policies and legal statute \nhave attempted to reduce age discrimination and reverse  stereotypes of older -workers.  These \nefforts have included HRD -interventions to upskill later -career employees to prolong their \nworkplace engagement but to also upskill their managers to understand how best to engage later -\ncareer employees.  However, the efficacy of these interventions is typically limited (Davis, 2023), \nwith later -career employees often taking retirement as soon as possible and diverting their energies \nelsewhere.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThis paper examines the lived experiences of later -career workers with the specific intention of \nunderstanding if/how they are engaged by work and how HRD might strengthen their continued \nengagement.  \n \nResearch questions  \nThree guiding questions are discerned:  \n1. How do later -career employees experience paid -employment?  \n2. How important for later -career employees is remaining engaged within their career?  \n3. How can HRD engender the engagement of later -career workers to extend working \nlives?  \n \nTheoretical base  \n \nThe paper draws upon models of engagement (Saks, 2019; Kwon & Kim, 2020) and models for EWL \n(Krekula and Vickerstaff, 2017; Kooij et al., 2020) to inform an empirical study involving structured \nqualitative data generation with 79 participants.  This sample  comprised participants self -identifying \nas aged 55+ and in employment, self -employment or undertaking voluntary work.  \n \nAnalysis and Implications  \n \nInitial analysis shows these later -career employees desired to engage with paid -employment for two \noverarching reasons.  First, many feared that work cessation signalled decline and vulnerability \nwhile they, second, feared for their cognitive health throug h “boredom and lack of mental \nstimulation”.  However, rather than striving for high performance and productivity, their desire was \nto give back and make a difference for others, while learning afresh and reinventing themselves \nthrough such work.  To achiev e this rejuvenation, the participants often sought alternative, bridge \njobs, whether paid or voluntary.  Where their financial situation necessitated that they continued \ntheir career job, many yearned to “step back and do something more fulfilling”."

In the context of public \nadministration, where the complexity of challenges requires innovative responses, the relationship \nbetween spiritual climate and Innovative Work Behavior (IWB) emerges as a topic of significant \ninterest. By promoting ethical values and interpersonal connections, the spiritual climate acts as an \naccelerator to encourage and enhance the innovative work behavior of public employees.  \n \nThe spiritual climate represents the collective perception of employees, providing an environment \nthat facilitates personal harmonization through the meaning attributed to work, the ability to \novercome individual limits and balance with the social and natu ral environment. Organizations \ngrounded in spiritual values offer greater opportunities for personal growth to employees, \nstrengthen interpersonal bonds, and attract and retain human resources. A spiritual work \nenvironment enables organizations to achieve much higher productivity compared to those that do \nnot focus on this aspect, thus achieving higher performance.  \n \nSpirituality practiced in the workplace not only positively impacts organizational performance but \nalso influences the innovative behavior of employees. Innovative work behavior represents \nemployees' intentional generation, introduction, and application of  innovations at work within a \ngroup or organization to contribute to performance. A spiritually enriched work environment \nstimulates the innovation and creativity of employees, positively impacting their innovative \nbehavior. It generates organizational awa reness, leading to creativity and innovation, deepens \nindividual awareness, amplifies intuitive capacity to enhance innovation, and simultaneously \nincreases a sense of duty and engagement to the organization.  \n \nTo promote IWB in the public sector, it is imperative to redefine organizational culture through \nspiritual leadership, the result of beliefs, attitudes, and actions that naturally inspire and engage \nemployees. Spiritual leadership enhances motivation, buil ds loyalty, and generates creative \npotential. The lack of spiritual leadership negatively impacts performance and organizational \nexpectations, influencing the organizational climate.  \n \nEstablishing a spiritual climate requires that employees are understood and valued, creating a \nsense of affection and belonging. Stimulating satisfaction, happiness, and joy among workers \nfosters higher motivation in task execution, increases the ability t o tackle more challenging tasks, \nand makes workers more inclined to embrace innovation. Inevitably, this leads to a reduction in \nwork stress.  \n \nIn this scenario, the study will be conducted through a bibliometric analysis of literature focused on \nqualitative and quantitative approaches in the context of public administration, utilizing recognized \nacademic databases to identify relevant studies. Th is approach will provide a comprehensive \noverview of current research trends and gaps, informing further developments in the field. This \npaper will present a future research agenda with the potential to generate new knowledge sharing \nin the field of public  administration.  \n \nKeywords:  innovative work behavior, workplace spirituality, engagement, public organizations, \nbibliometric analysis"

CIPD (2023) in their future workplace \ntrends note that COVID -19 has been a major disrupter and a ke y workforce change accelerator \nresulting in changes to how work is likely to be perceived in the coming decade. Studies argue that \nchanging workplace norms have resulted in increased job insecurity among workers, job \nintensification, increased use of techn ology and an associated requirement for skills development \nand changing boundaries of work and home (Hite and Macdonald, 2020; Watermeyer et al., 2021). \nIn the context of academic organisations, studies further argue that Higher education institutions \nhave  now moved from the ‘panic -gogy’ stage of COVID -19 and are at the transformation stage \nwhere distance working and other flexible approaches to learning and delivery have become more \ncommonplace (Dean & Campbell, 2020).   \n \nRecently, Cornelius -Bell and Bell (2021) have argued that academic work has turned out to be a \n‘precariat’ for academics who struggle to find job security, are denied a stable future, and are \nrequired to hold educational qualifications that are greater tha n labour market expectations.  \nFurthermore, they argue that a profit -driven approach has resulted in the ‘zombification’ of \nuniversities where academics must compete for the highest rated publications and teaching \nevaluation results.  Studies recommend fut ure research to investigate the ‘pulse of universities’ to \nbetter understand the transformation of the higher education workplace in challenging times \n(Watermeyer et al., 2021). In this context, it becomes imperative to update post -COVID -19 \nknowledge on or ganisational cultures within UK universities to support higher education policy \ndevelopment and enhance workplace practices to support UK academics.   \n \nWe argue that more can however also be learned from a complementary systematic review of the \nentire body of work discussing the impact of COVID -19 on organisational culture in UK Higher \nEducation Institutions. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to synthesise existing studies on \nthe impact of COVID -19 on the organisational culture of UK higher education institutions into \nrelevant topics and provide a road map for academic researchers and practitioners to further \ninvestigate such issues.  This review seeks to understand current research undertaken on such \ntopics and to synthesise research findings systematically to provide a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of post -COVID -19 workplace culture in UK higher education institutions.   \n \nMethodology  \n \nTo present our analysis, a search using Clarivate Analytics Web of Science (WoS) was undertaken for \nthe period between 2020 and 2023 inclusive. Following some experimentation with search strings, \nthe final search was undertaken using the search string ‘cul ture*’ AND ‘universit*’ AND ‘COVID -19’ \nOR ‘Covid -19’ in the TOPIC of the publication. By selecting the TOPIC, WoS searches the document \ntitles, abstracts, and keywords.

      "text": "141 \nID:72  – ‘Fair Work’ HR as a Route  to Employee Work Engagement  \nColin Lindsay, Patricia Findlay  & Johanna McQuarrie  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThere is evidence that improving work engagement can have benefits for organisational \nperformance and employee wellbeing (CIPD, 2021; Saks and Gruman, 2021).  Much of the extant \nresearch on antecedents of work engagement adopts the Job Demands Resources (JDR) model to \nidentify elements of job design that might enhance engagement among employees (Lesener et al., \n2020). There has been less emphasis on how job resources at the individual level combine with \nbroader, formal HR and employm ent practices to foster conditions for improved work engagement. \nThis working paper deploys mixed methods to explore the relationship between job demands and \nresources, a range of other progressive HR practices (which we term ‘Fair Work’ HR investments), \nand outcomes for employees in terms of work engagement and reduced burnout risk.  \n \nTHEORETICAL BASE  \n \nA substantial evidence base has sought to identify facilitators of ‘work engagement’ – ‘a positive, \nfulfilling, affective -motivational state of work -related wellbeing’ (Bakker and Leitner, 2010) – given \nthat there is evidence that higher levels of work eng agement may be associated with positive \noutcomes for both organisations (for example, reduced absenteeism and staff turnover and \nimproved productivity) and employees (for example, reduced burnout risk and better long -term \nwellbeing). There is evidence that  suggests that the interaction of job demands and job resources \n(such as peer and line manager support; autonomy; and access to effective feedback) is important \nto understanding variance in employees’ reported work engagement (Xanthopoulou and Bakker, \n2021 ). However, despite the clear importance of this JDR -informed research, fewer studies have \nsought to factor in a broader range of ‘progressive’ HR practices as potential drivers of difference in \nlevels of work engagement. This is despite the prioritisation  of ‘Decent Work’ or ‘Fair Work’ (and the \nworkplace and HR practices that might deliver it) by some policymakers, for example in the \ndevolved governments of the UK (Fair Work Wales, 2019; Scottish Government, 2022). This working \npaper builds from the defin ition of ‘Fair Work’ adopted by Scotland’s independent Fair Work \nConvention (2016) – ‘work that offers all individuals an effective voice, opportunity, security, \nfulfilment and respect’ – to operationalise Fair Work HR practices; and to explore how the pre sence \nof these practices, job demands and resources, and other workplace factors contribute to \ndifferences in work engagement among employees.  \n \nRESEARCH PURPOSE  \nThis working paper seeks to explore the potential importance of Fair Work HR practices and a range \nof other workplace practices and organisational factors in providing the context for work \nengagement. To address these issues, we first present a preliminary , high -level analysis of survey \nresponses from 3,665 employees across 30 UK organisations in six key sectors. We then present \ngood practice case study evidence from three organisations in the engineering, hospitality and non -\nprofit sectors (including 15 in -depth interviews with senior managers). We find that – controlling for \na range of organisational, sectoral and individual -level factors – the presence of what we term Fair \nWork HR practices is a key driver of work engagement in many cases (with other job resources such \nas levels of autonomy also significant). Work engagement is inversely related to self -reported \nburnout among employees. Our case studies identify drivers of Fair Work HR investments across \nsectors associated with: the need to retain staff; a  renewed emphasis on employee wellbeing \ninformed by experiences during the Covid -19 crisis; and business models that (despite the diverse \nsectoral coverage of our case studies) depended on engaged employees delivering high quality,"

Many of these theories have been developed with the goal to benefit organizational \ncultures and outcomes (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023). These leader ship theories have direct \nimplications to employee engagement and likely employee retention (Hurtienne et al. 2021).  \nHuman Resource Development plays an integral role in researching the intersection of leadership \ntheories and employee engagement, as “HRD recognizes that no organization can reach its full \npotential if its own employees are not fully engaged and productive” (Hurtienne, p. 96). According to \nBrad Shuck (2020), the human resource development community that engages employees will \n“work harder, a re more creative, and outperform their colleagues…experience life with less stress, \nreport higher levels of wellbeing, are less frequently burned out, and have a higher life satisfaction \nscore than other employees who report lower levels of engagement” (p.  59). \nIn professional organizations, it is not uncommon to see seventy -six percent of employees looking \nfor other job opportunities if they do not feel valued by their organization and leaders (Remedy, \n2021). A closer look reveals that only one in four employees  feel they are connected to the culture \nof the organization and only one in every three employees feel they belong at that their \norganization (Gallup, 2022). Seventy -six percent of employees look for other job opportunities if \nthey do not feel valued at wo rk (Remedy, 2021).  Apollo Technical (2022) notes that a third of all new \nemployees will leave their jobs within six months. There is also an average of four million \nemployees quit their jobs in 2022, with ten to twenty -two million job openings per month ( U.S. \nBureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).  \n \nConsidering organizational statistics, it is not surprising that only that only 23 percent of the global \nworkforce is effectively engaged at work and 31 percent of the workforce in North America (Gallup, \n2023). Additionally, organizations that report low e ngagement are more likely to see higher levels of \nturnover, at rates up to 18% to 43% more than organizations with highly engaged employees \n(Gallup, 2021). Organizations should also note that each employee that resigns can cost the \norganization one -half to  two times the employee's annual salary (Gallup, 2019). Collectively, these \nintricacies of employee engagement highlight the importance of organizations considering all \nvariables that impact employee engagement, performance, and retention, especially when \nidentifying the cost factors associated with employee retention.  \n \nHighly engaged employees demonstrate innovative behavior, better performance results, and a \ngreater intent to stay with the organization (Gull et al., 2020; Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). Employees \nwho are engaged, supported, and find meaning in their work can  impact organizational productivity \nand success (Hurtienne et al., 2021; Ramlall, 2008). Direct leaders can have a strong effect on \nemployee engagement (Hurtienne et al., 2021); therefore, it is vital to understand how leadership \napproaches can influence e mployees. There are many different types of leadership styles that have \nbeen published. Not all theories have been published with same level of academic rigor or the \nability to better understand the impact leadership models have a on employee engagement. T his \npaper will closely look through a constructive qualitative research lens at how the framework of \nequity leadership (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023; Hurtiene et al. 2023) impacts employee \nengagement."

Often, social exchange theory is seen as a \nguiding framework to better understand workplace behavior and decision -making (Cropanzano and \nMitchell, 2005). In addition, social exchange theory unders tands that “relationships evolve over time \ninto trusting, loyal, and mutual commitment” (p. 875). Through social exchange theory, an \nemployee’s engagement sets the stage for a cyclical reciprocation of positivity from the employer \n(Hurtienne et al., 2021, p. 141).  \n \nSocial Exchange Theory helps to provide a lens to examine working individuals and the expectations \nemployees have of their direct supervisor and other organizational leaders. This theory also speaks \nto the importance of organizations providing resources su ch as, salary, employee appreciation, \ntrust, etc. (Fuller et al., 2006; Blau, 1964). At the core, the fundamental principles of Social Exchange \nhelp to explain that humans, both leaders and employees, in work environments will choose \nappropriate behavioral  responses that will meet their own self -interests.  In summary, Social \nExchange Theory aids in understating how professional work relationships continues to move \nforward or come to an end; the measurement is based on a subject cost -benefit analysis betwee n \ntwo individuals (Hurtienne et al., 2023).  \n \nEquity leadership is a theory that focuses on the reciprocal interactions of social exchange theory as \nwell as the ERG theory of motivation (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023). Equity Leadership seeks to \nidentify individual employee’s personal and professional  resource, relationship, and opportunity \nneeds in an effort to support and encourage employees to research their fullest potential in the \nworkforce (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023, Hurtienne et al., 2023). The theoretical framework of \nEquity Leadership was originally published in the European Journal Training and Development \n(Huritenne and Hurtienne, 2023). Subsequently, a quantitative research design regarding the \nrelationships between equity leadership and employee engagement was published and presented \nat the 2023 University Forum of Human Resource Development (Hurtienne et al., 2023).   \n \nResearch Purpose  \n \nEven though equity leadership has been shown to have a positive relationship to employee \nengagement (Hurtienne et al, 2023) there has not been any formal qualitative study that researched \nat the deep and rich connections between equity leadership and emplo yee engagement. The \npurpose of this study is to further study the effect of equity leadership on employee engagement in \na professional business setting through a qualitative lens.  \n \nResearch Question/s  \n \nThe guiding research question for this constructive qualitative study is: How does the framework of \nEquity Leadership impact employee engagement?  \n \nImplications for HRD Practice  \n \nThe academic and practical fields of HRD look for ways to unleash expertise and improve \nperformance. The field is reminded that employees who feel connected and part of the organization \nare more likely to have higher employee engagement, increased retentio n, and perform better \n(Burke 2018, Swanson and Holton 2009, Hurtienne et al. 2021). Even though Equity Leadership has \nshown a positive relationship to employee engagement (Hurtienne et al. 2023), further research is \nneeded to better understand this relatio nship by uncovering deep and rich themes.

If an organization \nwants to hire, engage, and  retain talented employees, a focus must be placed on building a great \norganizational culture (Knierm et al, 2023), and recruiting and developing leaders is a good starting \npoint. A previous study showed that leaders can turn to the core concepts of equity  leadership to \nlearn about employee’s individual relationships, resources, and opportunity needs as a means of \nimproving employee engagement (Hurtienne et al, 2023).

Paper’s importance  \n \nEmployees implement political actions such as impression management to impress their \nsupervisors in order to advance their interests and influence in the organization. Subordinates \ncreate a good impression among their superiors by appearing to be high perf ormers and engaging \nin organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). When an employee acquires a good image in their \nsupervisor’s perception through impression management and receives rewards such as promotion \nand wage increase, other employees may experience  negative emotions such as relative deprivation \nand envy. The supervisor plays an important role in alleviating behaviors resulting from members’ \nnegative emotions.  \n \nThe supervisor should evaluate employees’ performance fairly and provide the same opportunities \nto employees who do not actively engage in impression management so that all employees \nperceive fairness in the organization. This study shows the importance of  using leaders’ political \nskills to create an atmosphere that encourages the maintenance of and cooperation with an \norganization’s ethical climate by alleviating the malicious envy caused by employees who manage \nimpressions for personal benefit, thus leadi ng to deviant behavior.  \n \n2. Theoretical base  \n \nSocial comparison between employees occurs frequently within organizations. When an employee \nwith a high level of impression management receives positive rewards, other employees may \nperceive the situation as unfair. According to the relative deprivation theory, when individuals \nperceive that they are unfairly disad vantaged through social comparisons, the resulting negative \nemotions lead to negative behaviors such as deviant behavior in the workplace.  \nSupervisors with strong political skills have excellent networking abilities, form good relationships \nwith subordinates, and have substantial social capital. According to the trait activation theory, an \nindividual’s personality traits are activated differe ntly depending on the situational context. \nTherefore, supervisors can use their political skills to moderate negative behaviors by \ncommunicating with employees and providing social capital to those employees who feel malicious \nenvy.  \n \n3. Research purpose  \n \nThis study examines the impact of malicious envy on the relationship between peer impression \nmanagement and workplace deviant behavior. In particular, the authors aim to investigate the role \nof leaders’ political skills in this relationship to provide a ba sis for interventions addressing \nworkplace deviant behavior.  \n \n4.

Paper’s importance  \nAs the concept of a lifetime job has disappeared, concepts of borderless careers and protean career \nattitudes are emerging within the organization, away from traditional career concepts that are \nvertical and hierarchical. In accordance with this rapidly ch anging work environment, individual \nleading career management and development are becoming important. Interest and effort in a \ncareer at the individual level are important. However, interest and support at the organizational \nlevel for the career developmen t of members, who are used as human resources, are also \nimportant. However, during career development, individuals experience career plateau due to \npyramid -type organizational structure and intense competition, which is becoming an inevitable \nphenomenon.  \n \nA career plateau is defined as a state in which the possibility of promotion to a higher position is \nlimited or there is a lack of opportunity to demonstrate competence in the current job. A career \nplateau was a limited concept of being stuck in a particul ar state due to the structurally low \npossibility of promotion. However, the term was expanded to include a state in which the meaning \nand interest in the job decreased due to limited opportunities for challenge in the job.  \nThis structural and content plateau is both a problem at the individual level and a problem that the \norganization must fix. Members experience career stagnation as career development opportunities \ndecrease depending on structural problems and personal char acteristics within the organization. \nFeldman and Weitz (1988) classified the causes of career plateau into individual, job, and \norganizational -level variables. At the individual level, individual skills and abilities, values or low \ngrowth needs, age, and y ears of service were classified as the causes. At the organizational level, \nlack of external compensation, stress, and deterioration of organizational growth were classified as \nthe causes.  \n \nCareer plateau is generally associated with negative consequences, such as an increase in job \nturnover intention, and is a factor that negatively affects both individuals and organizations, which \ncan be a problem for the organization's personnel management . Therefore, it is necessary to \nexplore in -depth aspects of each type of career plateau experienced by members of the \norganization due to personal, job, and organizational characteristics and to examine the effect of \ncareer plateau on outcome factors. Alth ough career plateau can be perceived in various ways within \nan individual due to contextual factors, previous studies have focused on exploring related variables \nusing regression analysis rather than focusing on career plateau characteristics and types. Po tential \nprofile analysis is a person -centered approach that analyzes individual response patterns to derive \nsubtypes. Therefore, it is possible to explore factors that affect career plateau and to identify \ndifferences in career satisfaction and job satisfa ction levels by potential profile based on the results \nof categorizing career plateau. This will enable us not only to find variables that affect career \nplateau but also to seek strategies and provide implications for career plateau. In particular, \nexamini ng the cause and effect factors of career stagnation will not only develop an individual's \nlong -term career and plan it through human resource management but also contribute to securing \nthe organization's competitiveness and sustainable growth.  \n \n2.

Feldman and Weitz (1986) proposed six \nantecedents contributing to career plateau, highlighting the co mplex interplay of factors such as \nlack of promotion opportunities, insufficient rewards, individual characteristics, and job -related \nstress. The comprehensive nature of the approach to career plateau aligns with the context and \nobjectives of this study. B y presenting practical solutions at both individual and organizational levels \nfor each type of career plateau, this paper aims to contribute a foundational basis for realistic \nproblem -solving.  \n \n3. Research purpose  \nThe primary objective of this study is to explore the latent profiles of career plateau types among \norganizational members and examine the distinctive characteristics associated with each type. \nFurthermore, the study aims to investigate the relationships b etween relevant variables in the \ncareer development process and the resolution of career plateau.  \n \n4. Research questions  \nRQ1: How many latent profiles can be identified based on career plateau among organizational \nmembers, and what are the distinctive characteristics of each latent profile?  \nRQ2: Among individual, organizational, and career factors, which factors significantly influence the \nclassification of latent profiles in career plateau?  \nRQ3: How do job satisfaction and career satisfaction differ based on latent profiles of career \nplateau?  \n \n5. Implications for HRD practice  \nFirst, it will be necessary to prepare an improvement in organizational support awareness by \ncreating an open organizational culture, personnel strategy, and career development system that \ncan be presented at the organizational level. Second, it is necessary to provide members with a \nsense of psychological well -being through various job participation (TF) opportunities that can \npositively affect members individually. Lastly, it is necessary to provide career development \nopportunities for members through various programs such as professional improvement education \naccording to the type of career plateau and leadership education by age/year.  \n \n6.

However, the convenience of internet access, while promoting workplace \nflexibility, presents a challenge in the form of cyberloafing. C yberloafing, defined as non -work -\nrelated online activities during working hours, poses significant financial and security risks, \nestimated at around $85 billion in annual losses. Effective leadership is essential for shaping a \npositive social image within organizations, where supervisors’ communication significantly \ninfluences subordinates’ job performance (Chen, Tsui, & Farh, 2002). Leadership styles play a critical \nrole in impacting organizational goals (Bass, 1990), influencing employee behavior, attitud es, and \noverall effectiveness (Steers & Black, 1994; Wagner & Hollenbeck, 2005). In a competitive external \nenvironment with pressures like heavy workloads, managers may experience frustration, leading to \nabusive supervisory behavior (Zellars, Tepper, & Duf fy, 2002). Negative leadership incurs \norganizational costs (Isen, 1987, 1999), while positive leadership contributes positively (Podsakoff et \nal., 1990; Hirt et al., 1997). Abusive supervision results in negative emotions and withdrawal \nbehaviors such as l ateness and poor work attitudes, including cyberloafing. Workplace internet \ndeviance (WID) is a prevalent issue impacting organizational operations. Managers seek to control \ncyberloafing as deviant behavior, while employees view it as a means of rest and m otivation \nrecovery. Diverse perspectives exist on the impact of cyberloafing.  \n \nSevere abusive supervision causes talent loss and negative organizational impacts, leading to \nsubordinates displaying adverse actions and emotions, reducing positive behaviors (He, Cai, 2018). \nThis results in negative work attitudes and decreased engagemen t (Harter, Schmidt, & Hayes, 2002; \nSchaufeli, Taris, & Van, 2008). High work engagement prompts dedicated efforts, while low \nengagement leads to detrimental behaviors. Positive leadership fosters positive behaviors in \nsupervisor -subordinate interactions, a ccording to reciprocal social exchange theory (Liden, & \nMaslyn, 1998).  \n \nProblem Statement  \n \nThis study investigated whether conclusions drawn from existing literature are applicable to the \nmilitary context, filling the gap in research as follows:  \n \n1. Abusive supervision has a negative impact on subordinates.  \nIn organizational hierarchies, abusive supervision can emerge, causing negative repercussions for \nsubordinates such as absenteeism and emotional distress. Despite the military’s shift towards \nhumane leadership, instances of abusive supervision persist due to task urgency. Severe cases \nnegatively affect talent retention and work attitudes. Research highlights emotional instability and \nwithdrawal behaviors among abused subordinates. The introduction of smartphones has led to \ncyberloafing during military work hours. This study addresses the gaps in research on military \nimpacts and explores the relationships between abusive supervision, emotional exhaustion, work \nengagement, and cyberloafing within militar y organizations.  \n \n2.

Their U.S. military studies reveal that grit reduces negative emotions and \nenhances adaptability (Duckworth et al., 2007; Duckwor th & Quinn, 2009; Duckworth et al., 2011). \nXiong and Yu’s (2023) study on Taiwanese military academy students shows higher grit correlates \nwith better adaptability and emotional well -being. Thus, This study focused on voluntary military \nofficers in Taiwan,  examining whether grit moderates the negative impact of abusive supervision on \nsubordinates’ feelings and work behaviors, contributing valuable insights.  \n \nResearch purpose  \n \nThis study conducted a quantitative study in the Taiwanese military context. We explored the \nimpact of abusive supervision on subordinates’ emotional exhaustion, work engagement, and \ncyberloafing. We also examined whether grit moderates the relationships among abusiv e \nsupervision and emotional exhaustion. Anticipating that data analysis can validate \ninterrelationships, this research contributes to HRD academia and practice.  \n \nHypotheses  \n \nH1: Abusive supervision is positively associated with subordinates’ emotional exhaustion.  \nH2: Subordinates’ emotional exhaustion is negatively associated with their work engagement.  \nH3: Subordinates’ emotional exhaustion is positively associated with their cyberloafing.  \nH4: Abusive supervision is negatively associated with subordinates’ work engagement.  \nH5: Abusive supervision is positively associated with subordinates’ cyberloafing.  \nH6: Emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and work \nengagement.  \nH7: Emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and cyberloafing.  \nH8: Grit moderates the positive relationship between abusive supervision and emotional \nexhaustion.  \nH9: Grit moderates the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion on the relationship between \nabusive supervision and work engagement.  \nH10: Grit moderates the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion on the relationship between \nabusive supervision and cyberloafing.  \n \nTheoretical foundation  \n \nBased on Resource Conservation Theory and Affective Events Theory, this study examined previous \nliterature on abusive supervision, emotional exhaustion, work engagement, cyberloafing, and grit. \nDrawing from existing literature, it is posited that subordina tes experiencing abusive supervision \nmay lead to emotional exhaustion, subsequently reducing work engagement and engaging in \ncyberloafing. Furthermore, this study explored the moderating role of grit in the relationship \nbetween abusive supervision and emot ional exhaustion.  \n \nMethodology  \n \nThis research framework consists of five constructs including abusive supervision and emotional \nexhaustion, work engagement, cyberloafing, and grit. All responses were assessed on a 7 -point \nLikert -type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).  \nThe abusive supervision scale established by Tepper (2000) was designed to measure the extent to \nwhich employees perceive their supervisors engaging in abusive behaviors. The emotional \nexhaustion scale, initially part of Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), ha s 5 items.

It exists in two versions, the long form (17 items) and the short form (9 \nitems), validated across various cultural and occupational contexts with good structural validity. This \nstudy utilized the short form, consisting of 3 items per dimension, totaling 9 questions. The scale \nrevised by Blanchard and Henle (2008) is employed, adapted from the questionnaire developed by \nLim and Chen (20 02). The scale assesses two dimensions: minor (9 items) and severe non -work -\nrelated internet use (8 items). This study employs Duckworth et al.,’s (2007) Grit scale, reduced to 8 \nitems by Quinn (2009). Assessing perseverance and passion, the modified versi on minimizes \nparticipant fatigue with 4 positive and 4 negatively phrased items. The Cronbach’s α for the \nreliability of use and acceptance of abusive supervision, emotional exhaustion, work engagement, \ncyberloafing and grit are .91, .87, .93,.87 and .81.  \nThe data was conducted during one month (August 2023) in Taiwan. Even though 510 online \nsurveys were answered, the missing data sections, unavailable and wrong key -in data were taken \nout. In the end a total of 409 samples of online surveys were used for da ta analysis, giving a \nresponding rate of 80.1%.  \n \nImplications for HRD practice  \n \nThis study can have several implications for HRD practice. First, the results suggest that the \npromoting correct perspectives among educational supervisors can reduce the occurrence of \nabusive supervision, and reducing cyberloafing behavior can mitigate us age risks.  \nInsufficient leadership training for frontline supervisors necessitates practical education like \ncommunication and leadership workshops. This integration reduces inappropriate supervision \ninstances, a common workplace problem with underestimated psychologi cal impacts on \nsubordinates. Organizations should prioritize managerial behavior to minimize costs.  \nIn this study defines work -related internet leisure, cyberloafing. Inappropriate supervision or high \nemotional exhaustion increases such behavior, seen as a means to relax. Widespread smartphone \nuse risks leaking confidential data and harming the military’ s image through sharing personal and \nwork -related information on social media.  \n \nSignificance/contribution to the HRD field  \n \nAs sustainability gains more attention, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) emerges as a \nvital indicator for organizations’ sustainable development. Operating at the organizational level, ESG \ninfluences ethical practices, social responsibilities, a nd employee engagement. Proactive ESG \npractices establish a robust corporate value system, elevate reputation, and attract top talent. \nEmployee engagement, crucial for sustainable human capital development, is emphasized in \ncorporate ESG evaluations. Despi te offering more meaningful work, recent trends show a decline in \nemployee engagement, prompting the need for effective human resource development (HRD). \nTalent management is pivotal in this competitive era, recognizing employees as the most valuable \nasset . In Taiwan, corporate sustainability involves an effective talent development system. \nAddressing high -tech warfare trends, the Ministry of National Defense’s professionalization policy \nfocuses on recruiting and training skilled, long -term volunteers, reco gnizing talent as crucial for \nnational military competitiveness (Defense Reports, 2021, 2023).  \nIn brief, three points can contribute to the HRD field. First, we examined a research framework of \nhow abusive supervision influence subordinates’ work attitudes and behaviors through emotional \nexhaustion. Second, this study provides grit research on milit ary aspect to HRD field in Taiwan \ncontext.

Researchers and business \nprofessionals continue to prioritize work engagement as a means of enhancing employee \nperformance, well -being, and organizational effectiveness in the face of adversity (Mazzetti et al., \n2021).  \n \nAccording to Kahn (1990), workers are engaged at work when they believe their jobs have a \npurpose, that their employability is secure, and that they have enough resources at their disposal to \ncomplete their tasks. Employees who are engaged at work exhibit high levels of vigor, commitment, \nand excitement for their jobs. They have a sense of challenge and meaning in their job, are \nengrossed in and engaged in the tasks at hand, and are feeling fulfilled and satisfied (Mazzetti et al., \n2021). Furthermore, emplo yees' perceptions and interpretations of their work lives have an impact \non their level of work engagement (Shuck et al., 2011). To promote work engagement, many \nresearchers suggest that cultivating workplace spirituality would help. Workplace spirituality  refers \nto the concept of bringing spiritual aspects of individuals into the work environment, allowing \nemployees to bring their whole selves to work, search for meaning in work, and make \ninterconnection with others at work (Ashmos & Duchon, 2000). Spiritu al employees experience \ntranscendence, meaningful work with mindfulness, and compassion for others (Petchsawang & \nDuchon, 2009).  \n \nAnother important individual factor influencing work engagement is personality traits (Kahn, 1990). \nPeople have different perceptions in life because they hold different personality traits (Cattell, \n1964). Personality traits can be defined as a taxonomy of  five dimensions that capture the \nfundamental aspects of human personality which comprises with openness, conscientiousness, \nextraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism or emotional stability so called Big Five (Ji & Esqueda, \n2022). While some researchers  suggested that agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to \nexperiences among employees have a higher level of work engagement than other personality \ntraits (Hau & Bing, 2018; Shukla et al., 2014), other researchers have revealed different findings \n(Hopwood et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2009; Prieto -Díez et al., 2022). There is a need to verify the \nprevious research findings and explore a mechanism that plausible account of the processes that \ncause the relationships. Additionally, it is also intriguing to  look at the relationship between \npersonality traits and work engagement and the mediator role of workplace spirituality.  \n \nThis study aims to address two questions. Is Big Five personality traits an antecedent to workplace \nspirituality and work engagement, and what are the relationships between them? This study falls \nunder the post -positivist paradigm. Quantitative methodology , survey method, and structural \nequation modeling will be adopted. This study will benefit the human resources development (HRD) \nfield by highlighting the importance of workplace spirituality as a means to enhance work \nengagement, which ultimately enhances  employee performance, well -being, and organizational \neffectiveness.  \n \nKeywords:  Big Five personality traits, Work engagement, Workplace spirituality"

For example, while workers are given many \nopportunities for continuous learning and efficient work through techn ological support and \nautomation, they suffer from the stress of responding to the rapid pace of technological and \nenvironmental changes. Additionally, as remote work has become more popular since the \npandemic, technology has blurred the boundaries between work and life. This phenomenon \nsuggests that HRD should pay more attention to employees' work -life balance in this digital age and \nstrive to increase work engagement and job satisfaction.  \n \nWork -life balance (WLB) is the healthy equilibrium between work, play, and love that makes \nindividuals productive (Kofodimos, 1993). It is linked to employee job and life satisfaction and is \nseen as a rewarding experience that requires proper distribution of personal resources (Clark, \n2000). Job satisfaction (JS) encompasses emotional alignment with one's career, contentment with \ncompensation, and positive emotional responses to work tasks (Locke, 1969). Work Engagement \n(WE) is critical to obtain job satisf action and is characterized by enthusiasm, commitment, and deep \nabsorption (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). WE has three dimensions: vigor, dedication, and absorption.  \nNumerous studies on the relationship between WLB, JS, and WE exist. Among them, many studies, \nespecially focusing on millennials who have experienced both the pros and cons of digitalization \n(Gabrielova & Buchko, 2021), highlight the importance of this topic in the workplace. According to \nrecent studies, there is a positive causal relationship between WLB and  JS (Susanto et al., 2022), and \nsome components of WLB and WE (Jaharuddin & Zainol, 2019), and a positive relationship between \nWE and JS (Garg, Dar, & Mishra, 2018). However, there are few studies linking these three variables \nsimultaneously. Also, because  existing studies have focused on millennials, there is a lack of \nresearch on Generation Z, who are currently entering the workplace.  \n \nThis study aims to investigate the relationship between WLB, JS, and WE among Generation Z \nemployees in Moroccan organizational settings. The research questions are as follows:  \n1) What is the relationship between (each dimension of) WLB and JS?  \n2) What is the relationship between WLB and WE?  \n3) What is the relationship between WE and JS?  \n4) Does WE mediate the relationship between WLB and JS?  \n \nThe data will be collected through a survey. The sample is 250 Gen Z employees working for more \nthan one year in a Moroccan organization. Data will be analyzed using SPSS. Linear regression will \nbe used to identify the relationship between the variables. A dditionally, bootstrapping techniques \nwill be used to test the mediating role of WE.    \n \nThis study will advance our understanding of Gen Z, who, along with millennials, will become the \nmajority of workers in the digital age. In addition, the study is expected to show the relationship \nbetween the three variables WLB, JS, and WE more clearly. F inally, this study will expand the breadth \nof HRD empirical research by adding the Moroccan organizational context, which is lacking in the \nexisting literature.  \n \nKeywords:  Work -life balance, job satisfaction, work engagement, Generation Z"

Now seems to be a suitable time to take a look at the origins of \nsuch behavior.  \n \nHRD scholars began studying incivility around 2008 -2011, but its roots go back further than that in \nthe management literature. Moreover, incivility and workplace bullying have evolved to \ncyberbullying in the workplace (Escartin et al., 2021; Piotrowski, 20 12). By investigating the history of \nthe study of toxic behavior, we should gain new insights into the violence of today’s headlines, as \nwell as implications for HRD research and practice today.  \n \nThis paper introduces the topics of workplace incivility, bullying, and cyberbullying and defines the \nterms and constructs for these topics. It reviews the history of incivility and workplace violence in \nthe two decades from 1980 -2000. It then reviews the most recent toxic continuum of incivility to \nworkplace bullying and cyberbullying to workplace violence and hate crimes in the last few years.  \nThe paper also discusses a theoretical framework for incivility. Andersson and Pearson (1999) \ndefined workplace incivility as “low -intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the \ntarget, in violation of workplace norms for mutual respect. Unci vil behaviors are characteristically \nrude and discourteous, displaying lack of regard for others” (p. 457). Schilpzand et al. (2016) \ndescribed this as a social interactionist theory and provided two other options for a unifying \ntheoretical framework for in civility theory (see page S81). Another possible theory is affective events \ntheory (Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996), which is similar to Tracy and Robins’ (2006) appraisal model \nof self -conscious emotions, the theoretical framework utilized by Miranda, Welbour ne and Sariol \n(2020) in their study measuring shame and guilt in observers of workplace incivility. Eversole and \nGraham (2012) suggested Goffman’s stigma theory to explain the instigator’s affect. Miner et al. \n(2018) also suggested more avenues for theoret ical expansion.  \n \nWorkplace bullying goes further and actually creates a toxic environment that impedes the learning \nand development of employees (Reio Jr. and Ghosh, 2009). Similar to incivility, the interactionist \nframework (Samnani and Singh, 2016) theorizes that bullyin g has impacts beyond the individual \naffected to work groups and the organizational system itself. Valentine, Giacalone, and Fleischman \n(2021) found that workplace bullying indeed leads to mistrust of others and a political view of jobs, \nleading to decrease d work group effectiveness and ultimately decreased organizational \neffectiveness.  \n \nFinally, the paper discusses implications for research and practice. Implications for research include \nantecedents and mediating variables associated with emotions, personality, intersectionality and \nuncivil behavior and the association between incivility and hate crimes. Implications for practice \ninclude training & development programs, organization development cultural change efforts, and \nperformance management to monitor behavior and arrange consequences."

Wilson  & Kim Nimon  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThis study introduces an inventory of 12 single -item measures of employees’ perceptions of the \ncharacteristics of work, organized around three domains: the host organization, the people \ninvolved, and the job itself.  \n \nEmployee engagement has been conflated and potentially misinterpreted throughout the literature \n(Kaufman et al. 2020; Schaufeli 2014) leading some researchers to examine antecedents of \nengagement at the lowest levels, beginning with employees’ cognition of  work characteristics \n(Zigarmi et al. 2011).  \n \nResearch details the effects of employees’ perceptions of their working conditions as antecedents to \nintentions and consequential behaviors (e.g., Zigarmi et al. 2009; Nimon et al. 2011). While several \nfactors intervene this relationship, this path of perc eption to intention is significant in the \noverarching concept of employee engagement (Shuck et al. 2017). In the digital age filled with social \nmedia, online employer reviews, quiet -quitting, and other disruptions to the traditional employee -\nemployer relat ionship, researchers have suggested organizations may benefit from measuring \nindicators of engagement and satisfaction regularly using Pulse Surveys (Bakker 2014; Brown 2022).  \n  \nIncreased frequency of assessment and advances in digital survey deployment (e.g. SMS, West et al. \n2015; mobile web, Toepoel and Lustig 2022) necessitate reducing the length of instruments. Shorter \nscales decrease response burden and increase administratio n convenience. Many widely -accepted \ninstruments have been shortened (e.g., Utrecht Work Engagement Scale; UWES -3, Schaufeli et al. \n2019). Matthews, Pineault, and Hong (2022) advocated for the use of single -item instruments in \nbehavioral science research an d provided a framework for the development of such measures.  \n \nAcknowledging the need for short instruments to measure facets of employee engagement, the \npurpose of this study is to develop and validate the 12 -item Work Characteristics Inventory (WCI -12), \nconsisting of single -item measures of employees’ perception of:  Organizational Characteristics \n(Distributive Justice, DJ; Growth, GR; Performance Expectations, PE; Procedural Justice, PJ); People \nCharacteristics (Collaboration, CO; Connectedness with Colleagues, CC; Connectedness with Leader, \nCL; Feedback, FB); and Jo b Characteristics (Autonomy, AU; Meaningful Work, MW; Task Variety, TV; \nand Workload Balance, WB). Following the process introduce by Matthews et al. (2022), we test the \nfollowing hypotheses:  \n \nH1: WCI -12 demonstrates empirically acceptable definitional correspondence with the measured \nconstructs.  \nH2: WCI -12 demonstrates empirically acceptable test -retest reliability.  \nH3: WCI -12 correlates to longer validated scales measuring the same constructs.  \nH4: Outcomes predicted by the WCI -12 correlate with outcomes predicted by longer validated scales \nmeasuring the same constructs.  \n \nTo test, we develop a series of instruments in Qualtrics deployed to participants sampled from \nProlific. H1 requires participants to rate the degree which the proposed items match the constructs’ \ndefinitions with .60 representing acceptable correspondence.  H2 incorporates a between -person \nexperimental design with three groups responding across three temporal conditions (Matthews \n2022). An ICC greater than .40 demonstrates support. H3 is tested by correlating scale scores of \nNimon and Zigarmi’s Work Cognitio ns Inventory -Revised (WCI -R, 2015a) to the related scores"

Thus, it is important to explore, as we \ndo in this study: (1) the impact of technological change on workers; and (2) opportunities, barriers, \nand equity in a time of technological a nd economic transformation.  \nTheoretical Base  \nWe employed an equity theory lens (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2011; Huseman, Hatfield & Miles, 1987). \nIn the context of technological change and the changing nature of work, applying equity theory \nhelped us understand the disparities in workers’ experiences with technological change and \nprovided insights into how the adoption of technologies may affect perceptions of fairness in the \nworkplace.  \n  \nResearch Purpose  \n \nWe conducted a qualitative, exploratory study to explore the perceptions and experiences of a \ndiverse sample of workers regarding the impact of technological change on workers. Semi -\nstructured interviews (N=11) were conducted with participants from a varie ty of industries and \nrepresentatives from different diversity -focused stakeholder groups.  \n \nResearch Questions  \n \n1.What are the equity gaps that exist due to a changing technological work environment?  \n2.What are the opportunities and challenges that workers experience due to technological change?  \n  \nImplications for HRD practice  \n \nParticipants viewed technological change as both a threat and an opportunity. Some participants \nexpressed concerns about job displacement and the difficulty of keeping up with rapidly evolving \ntechnology. Others saw technological change as an opportunity f or job enhancement and the \ncreation of new, technologically -based jobs.  \n \nIn terms of the skills and knowledge required for future work, participants identified the need for \nadaptability, flexibility, and a willingness to continuously learn and upskill. Participants also cited the \nimpact of the pandemic on advancing technologica l change in their workplaces. In particular, the \nsudden shift to remote work, and the need for organizations to continue operations in the face of \nlockdowns/healthcare directives, accelerated the adoption of new technologies and transformed \nthe way work is  done.  \n \nParticipants further identified potential equity issues that arise from technological change in the \nworkplace. This included the digital divide, with some population groups having less access to \ntechnology."

This study delves into demographic transformations, with a specific \nfocus on the Brazilian landscape, where the aging of the populati on has become increasingly \npronounced. Recent data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) \nunderscores a persistent aging trend, indicating a notable increase in the average age of the \nBrazilian population by six years since 2010, r eaching 35 years in 2022. Moreover, the elderly \npopulation, aged 60 or older, has surged to represent 15.6% of the overall demographic, marking a \nsignificant 56% increase from 2010.  \n \nIn response to these demographic shifts, the Brazilian government, under President Bolsonaro in \n2019, implemented a comprehensive pension reform. The rationale behind this reform, as reported \nby the Senate, was directly linked to the aging population and the resultant strain on the pension \nsystem. Th ese demographic shifts have profound implications not only for societal structures but \nalso for organizational dynamics, necessitating a recalibration of public policies and the introduction \nof awareness programs to address emerging challenges such as agei sm. There are various versions \nregarding the categories related to these generations. One of them, generation Y, the focus of this \nstudy, comprises individuals between 30 and 45 years old, approximately.  \n \nA critical dimension of these changes is the increasing coexistence of multiple generations in the \nworkplace.. The need to foster a harmonious organizational climate, characterized by employees \nworking collaboratively towards positive outcomes, underscores  the significance of acknowledging \nmultigenerational dynamics as a catalyst for enrichment. This recognition becomes particularly \npertinent in an era where diversity and inclusion are central themes.  \n \nNavigating interactions among individuals within an organizational setting is already a complex task, \ncompounded further when considering generational differences. The public sector, where stability \noften results in individuals working in the same environm ent throughout their contributory years, \namplifies this interaction, given the regularity of public service examinations over the years.  \nThe study is situated at the Federal Fluminense University, located in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. \nEstablished in 1960, the institution boasts academic units in Niterói and eight other municipalities in \nthe state. As of 2020, the university accommodat ed approximately 57,600 active students across on -\nsite and distance learning programs, along with 7,540 teaching and administrative staff dispersed \nacross 45 educational units.  \n \nContextualizing our thematic focus, the research aims to answer the question: \"How is \nmultigenerational coexistence perceived at the Federal Fluminense University by Generation Y \nemployees?\" The specific objective is to obtain relevant insights into the interaction between \ngenerations within the  public service environment, particularly from the perspective of Generation \nY. This generation plays a pivotal role in bridging older and younger cohorts, embodying a unique \nposition in the generational spectrum. Also, the choice os this generation was du e to the availability \nof more individuals in this age group for participation in the research, without invalidating the \nperception of other generations, which is intended to be investigated in future studies."

Initiatives for innovative worker engagement surface organically, intertwined with the \ndiscussion on harmonious work environments and the acknowled gment of generational diversity. \nThe effectiveness of such engagement becomes apparent in the perceived harmony at the \nworkplace and the interconnectedness of worker satisfaction.  \n \nThe intricate interplay between worker engagement and organizational culture is illuminated by the \ndiscussion on respect, communication, and collaboration among different generations. As the \nresearch participants express their willingness to contribute to a more inclusive and harmonious \nworkplace, they inherently address the core elements of fostering an organizational culture that \nvalues diversity and respects individual contributions.  \n \nThe impact of technology on worker engagement, a focal point in the research, resonates with the \nbroader theme of understanding how technological advancements influence worker commitment. \nThe challenges and opportunities presented by technology, as discuss ed by Generation Y \nemployees, shed light on the nuanced relationship between technological integration and \nmultigenerational work dynamics.  \n \nIn essence, this comprehensive exploration of multigenerational coexistence at the Federal \nFluminense University not only enriches our understanding of Generation Y perspectives but also \nprovides valuable insights aligned with the broader congress themes. The findings underscore the \ncomplexity of managing generational diversity in the contemporary workplace, necessitating \nstrategic approaches for effective integration. Strategies encompassing comprehensive training \nprograms and initiatives fostering continu ous learning emerge as crucial for facilitating a seamless \ntransition amidst technological changes.  \n \nAs we reflect on the convergence between theoretical frameworks and research outcomes, the \nstudy advocates for nuanced strategies that recognize the distinct needs and strengths of different \ngenerations. The recognition of these dynamics provides a solid f oundation for practical \nrecommendations and management strategies discussed in theoretical frameworks. This alignment \nsuggests that theoretical frameworks are reflective of the workplace reality investigated, offering a \nrobust basis for practical recommend ations and management strategies outlined in the theoretical \nframework.  \n \nIn conclusion, the study demonstrates the intricate dynamics of multigenerational coexistence, \noffering pragmatic insights for managing the ever -evolving workplace. This comprehensive \nexploration encompasses theoretical and practical implications, paving t he way for reflections on \ninnovative initiatives, effectiveness assessments, and the promotion of inclusive environments \nwithin the context of generational coexistence.  \n \nKeywords:  Multigenerational coexistence; Public servants; Generation Y"

When individuals perceive that their work is meaningful in their lives, the benefits \nextend beyond the personal level, positively impacting th e workplace and organization. This has led \nto the need to identify ways to support workers in finding meaning in their work and create a \nworkplace environment in which employees experience meaningful work (MW). Thus, it is important \nfor HRD to help employe es perceive their work as meaningful, fostering the growth of both \nemployees and the organization.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nThis study aims to explore how HRD can create a workplace where early -career employees can \nexperience their work as meaningful, with a focus on learning from social relationship (LSR), which \npromotes meaningful work (MW), and organizational commitment (OC)  and job involvement (JI) as \nthe outcomes of meaningfulness.  \n \nTheoretical Base  \nMeaningful work is defined as “work that is personally significant and worthwhile” (Lysova et al., \n2019, p. 375). Studies on MW explore how individuals percieve and relate to their work and how this \nrelationship influences their life, work, and workplace ( Rosso et al., 2010). MW can be promoted by \nvarious factors such as leadership (Lee et al., 2017; Tummers & Knies, 2013), organizational culture \n(Cardador & Rupp, 2011; Sorakraikitikul & Siengthai, 2014), HR policies (Albrecht et al., 2015; \nFletcher, 2019),  and positive interactions among employees (Grant, 2007; Kahn, 2007). Especially, an \norganizational learning culture, in which open and supportive communication and interaction are \npromoted (Watkins & Marsick, 1993), enables employees to experience positiv e meaning in their \nwork (Lysova et al., 2019) and establish positive attitudes towards their organization and job, such \nas commitment to the organization (Song et al., 2013) and job involvement (Brown, 1996). When \nemployees feel significant in their work w ithin an organizational environment in which learning \nfrom social relationships (LSR) is supported, they are likely to have a high level of commitment to \norganization because they perceive their contributions as meaningful (Steger et al., 2012). Thus, this  \nstudy developed the following hypotheses.  \n \nResearch Questions/Hypotheses  \nH1: LSR is positively related to MW.  \nH2: LSR is positively related to affective commitment and JI.  \nH3: MW works as mediating role between LSR and OC or JI.  \n \nMethodology  \nWe gathered date on LSR (Yang et al., 2004), OC (Meyer & Allen, 1991), JI (Kanungo, 1982), MW \n(Steger et al., 2012). Using the data obtained from 286 early -career employees in South Korea, we \nanalyzed the correlation between variables and conducted the three -step regression analysis \n(Baron & Kenny, 1986) to verify the mediating effect."

This shift is evident with nearly 50% of U.S. employees now voluntarily \nchanging jobs, compared to about 40% a decade ago (U.S. Bureau  of Labor Statistics, 2009, 2022). \nThe COVID -19 pandemic's impact on work norms, such as remote work, has highlighted the need \nfor ensured performance in a dynamic world. As a result, there is a heightened focus on how job -\ncrafting enhances work engagement , especially with flexible work models, including remote and \nhybrid work (Wijngaards et al., 2022).  \n \nJob-crafting enables individuals to reshape their work's meaning and tasks (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, \n2001), specifically for those in flexible work environments. Meanwhile, work engagement refers to a \npositive, fulfilling, work -related state of mind characte rized by vigor, dedication, and absorption \n(Schaufeli et al., 2002). Research suggests job -crafting enhances engagement along with perceived \nwork meaningfulness and performance (Lee & Lee, 2018) and benefits organizations by boosting \ncommitment and prosoci al behaviors (Wang et al., 2018).  \nTherefore, exploring the previous discussion on job -crafting and work engagement from Human \nResource Development (HRD) perspectives with a focus on flexible working conditions can help \naddress the concerns of individual employees and organizations. Despite  the obvious relationships, \nthere is a lack of inquiry regarding how these impacts provide insights for HRD. Consequently, this \nreview gains greater significance for both individual and organizational success.  \n \nResearch Purpose and Questions  \nTo explore job -crafting and work engagement among employees with flexible work arrangements, \nand building upon previous studies on these topics, we formulated three research questions:  \n \n1. How have job -crafting and work engagement for employees in flexible work arrangements \nbeen studied?  \n2. What is the relationship between job -crafting and work engagement in flexible work \narrangements?  \n3. What implications for HRD can be drawn from the existing literature?  \n \nResearch Method  \nWe apply the integrative review approach that allows researchers to comprehensively analyze and \nsynthesize existing literature (Toracco, 2005; Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). By integrating key findings \nidentified from relevant studies, we capture the relations hips between employee job -crafting and \nwork engagement in flexible work arrangements and gain insights for HRD. We follow the literature \nscreening process suggested by Toracco (2005).  \n \nImplications for HRD Practice  \nThis review examines how integrating job -crafting and work engagement in flexible work \narrangements can improve HRD practices, focusing on enhancing performance and reducing \nturnover intentions (Seppälä et al., 2020). The findings underscore the importance of HRD \nprofessionals supporting job -crafting to elevate work engagement at individual and team levels. The \ninsights offer guidance for achieving beneficial outcomes for individuals, teams, and organizations."

However, \nrecent data shows that EE levels are plummeting due to number of factors such as competitive war \nfor talent increasing (Mercer, 2019), multi -generational working (i.e. up to 4 generations working \nside by side Plaskoff, 2017), techno logical disruptions such as the use of AI in task completion and \nan increased need for employee wellbeing post Covid -19 (Tucker, 2020). Thus, this brings to sharp \nfocus on the need for employees to be seen as consumers in the workplace with the option of \nchoice. Thus, the need to explore antecedents of EE cannot be overemphasised in ensuring global \nEE levels are improved (Morgan, 2017).  \n \nA key term Employee Experience (EX) is one such key antecedent. Affiliated to EE, EX s taking a \ngreater foothold especially among HR practitioners within the profession (Deloitte, 2017). With a \n2020 LinkedIn Talent report highlighting an increased 240% usa ge of the term by members who \ncited EX in their job titles (Bridger and Gannaway, 2021) thus indicating an increased focus on this \nsubject/discipline by greater majority of practitioners. This is further strengthened with the \nChartered Institute of Personn el Development (CIPD) integrating employee experience as a \nspecialist knowledge category in their professional standards (CIPD 2021; CIPD 2023).  Additionally, \nPanneerselvam and Balaraman (2022) suggested that employee experience is increasing its \nfootprin t in HR practice for reasons due to continuous technological advancement and increased \nimportance of Wellbeing in workspaces post Covid -19. \n \nBased on a 2023 qualitative study conducted within Company X (a multinational energy \norganisation and a top five global largest company in the world by revenue) with over 70,000 global \nworkforce. Eleven HR Business Partners practitioners were sampled using  semi -structured \ninterviews from a population of 39, representing a large demographic base, range of the company \neight business lines as well as nationalities and an additional interview with an external industry \nexpert to compare findings with regional an d global trends. All sampled HR Business Partners are \nhighly experienced practitioners with key role duties comprising stewardship of the company’s \ntalent and performance cycles and employee engagement response plans.  \n \nOur study outcomes suggested that ‘activating leadership’ which is an act of creating needed \nawareness and sense of responsibility on the part of company leaders at all levels is a crucial \nenabler to the successful deployment of EX strategy mechanisms which is an antecedent for EE. \nParticipants asserted that activating leadership spectrum of interventions should include \nmeasurable actions such as senior management role -modelling, training, communications, and \nintegrating employee engagement as a mechanism to reward and promot e leaders. The later can \nbe done by embedding EX outcomes in each leader’s KPI’s and performance goals.  \n \nKeywords:  Employee Experience, Employee Engagement, Leadership, Leadership Activation."

Crowder  \n \nABSTRACT  \nIn today's highly competitive market, industries including healthcare are increasingly concerned \nabout retaining employees (Anderlini, 2018). Employee retention has long been a priority for HR \nmanagers as it is crucial to the success of any business and re lates to strategies aimed at \nmaintaining a stable workforce. Retaining skilled and experienced employees ensures that \ncompanies have capable staff while also boosting morale and motivation (Anderlini, 2018).  \nEmployee retention in the healthcare industry in the United States has posed significant challenges \nwith turnover rates estimated between 20% and 30% over the past decade (Colosi, 2022). Factors \ncontributing to this issue include lengthy working hours, hig h stress levels, burnout, lack of work -life \nbalance along with shortages of qualified professionals creating a competitive job market.  \nThe turnover of healthcare professionals such as nurses comes with considerable costs averaging \n$22,000 per replacement due to factors like training time for new hires and decreased productivity \n(McHugh et al., 2011). Extensive research has been conducted on this topic; however, findings have \nbeen inconsistent. Singh & Loncar (2010) discovered that compensation and benefits may not \nalways be sufficiently competitive for employee retention within healthcare whereas Baker & Sutner \n(2022) disagreed with this p erspective.  \n \nTheoretical Framework  \nA sense of belonging is one of several human needs outlined by Maslow (1943) as a powerful \nmotivator of human behavior. He believed that individuals were unable to pursue their full potential \nuntil they had satisfied basic needs of safety, belonging, and esteem, and if those needs we re met, \nindividuals were better equipped mentally to grow. Rosenberg and McCullough (1981) stated sense \nof belonging is a feeling of connectedness, that one is important or matters to others. Baumeister \nand Leary (1995) argued that people have a “pervasive  drive to form and maintain at least a \nminimum quantity of lasting, positive, and significant interpersonal relationships” (p. 497), and \nlacking fulfillment of this need results in significant decrements to well -being.  \nMaslow (1998) also suggested that if belongingness could be applied to individual’s educational \nachievements, belongingness in the work environment could also influence employees and their \nrelationship to one’s work. Among employees, belongingness is a rec iprocal relationship that \nprovides a feeling that employees matter to each other and their needs will be met through that \nrelationship (McMillan & Chavis, 1986). Within organizations, each employee benefits from being \npart of the organization, and the orga nization benefits from the contributions of each employee.  \nIn order to retain employees effectively, organizations must convey a sense of belongingness and \nvalue. This can be achieved by creating a perception of unity within the organization where \neveryone works together towards shared success. Organizational cult ure can indirectly impact \nemployee retention as well. When employees feel like they fit into the culture, it creates a sense of \nbelonging and fosters strong emotional ties between them and the organization. Furthermore,  \nwhen workers believe that their employer values and appreciates them, they are more inclined to \nremain loyal.  \n \nPurpose  \nExisting employee retention strategies in healthcare include competitive salaries and benefits, \ntraining, and development, fostering a positive work environment, and offering flexible work \narrangements and telecommuting options. However, the problem persis ts. To address these \nconcerns, this study aimed to identify new strategies for employee retention in healthcare by \ndetermining the key factors important to healthcare employees, identifying effective retention"

Specifically, the researchers examined how leveraging social media, \nparticularly TikTok and Instagram could serve as an emp loyee retention strategy for nurse \npractitioners in the healthcare industry.  \n \nSocial media has emerged as a powerful tool that is being used for branding, marketing etc. by \nmany industries to create a presence. With millions of people actively using social media platforms \nlike TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn, these platforms offer a  unique opportunity for healthcare \norganizations to connect with their employees, engage them, and ultimately retain them. The use of \nsocial media as an employee retention strategy has gained considerable attention in recent years, \nparticularly in industri es such as healthcare where employee turnover and burnout were prevalent. \nWith work life balance getting more and more difficult to attain, healthcare workers are often left \nwith the feeling disconnected from both their colleagues and their workplaces. Thi s lack of \nconnection can have detrimental effects on their job satisfaction, overall well -being, and even \npatient outcomes. However, social media platforms have the potential to bridge this gap and create \na sense of community among healthcare employees. Re search questions included:  \n \n1. How does the use of social media contribute to employee retention in the healthcare industry?  \n2. How does the implementation of social media promote a sense of belonging among nurse \npractitioners in the healthcare industry?  \n \nImplication for practice in HRD  \nOne significant aspect of using social media in healthcare settings is the opportunity it provides \nemployees to connect with one another (Mulauzi, 2018). Traditional work structures often hinder \ninteraction between different departments and shifts, leading  to limited opportunities for \nmeaningful connections within the organization. By utilizing social media platforms, healthcare \nworkers can easily establish connections with colleagues they may not interact with on a regular \nbasis. This leads to increased co llaboration, knowledge sharing, and an overall sense of belonging \nwithin the organization.  \n \nThe results of the study revealed that nurse practitioners perceived social media as a valuable tool \nfor employee retention. It proved to be a valuable tool that can be harnessed to improve employee \nretention for nurse practitioners, particularly for trave ling nurses, promoting a sense of work -life \nbalance, and helping nurses access additional compensation through brand deals. In addition, the \nability to connect and engage with colleagues, share knowledge and best practices, and seek \nsupport and advice from  a wider network were identified as key advantages. Nurse practitioners \nhighlighted how social media platforms allowed them to build relationships, both professionally and \npersonally, fostering a sense of belonging and community within the healthcare indus try (Dewanto \n& Wardhani, 2018).  \n \nBelongingness is essential for individuals, including healthcare employees, to feel connected and \nengaged in their work (Wu, 2013). Social media platforms play a crucial role in fostering this sense of \nbelonging by allowing healthcare professionals to shar e their experiences, challenges, and \nsuccesses, creating trust and unity among colleagues (Wu, 2013).  \nAdditionally, social media provides an outlet for healthcare workers to decompress from the high -\nstress nature of their job. By discussing their day -to-day experiences with like -minded peers who \nunderstand the unique demands of the profession on these plat forms can be highly therapeutic \n(Wu, 2013). Moreover, by sharing stories and experiences on social media platforms like Twitter or \nLinkedIn helps them learn from one another giving insights into different areas within the field \nwhile also discovering innov ative approaches to patient care."

Employee \nengagement has been referred to as involvement, commitment, passion, absorption, enthusiasm, \ndedic ation, zeal, and even energy. This underlines the strong division between practitioners and \nresearchers as to whether the concept is “employee engagement” or “work engagement.” This lack \nof a generally acceptable definition for the concept has been attribu ted to how the popularity of the \nemployee engagement quickly manifested in the practitioner community with much focus on the \nrelated positive outcomes as against clearly conceptualising the term Macey and Schneider, 2008).  \n \nTHEORETICAL BASE  \nThis study attempts to understand and conceptualise employee engagement from the perspectives \nof both HRD/M practitioners and researchers. Severally, HRD/M practitioners and researchers have \nconsistently avoid defining employee engagement in their differen t studies. Hence, this study draws \non the analyses of Little & Little (2006), Macey & Schneider (2008) and Shuck (2011) to empirically \ninvestigate the meanings accrued to employee engagement from the perspectives of both HRD/M \npractitioners and researchers . This comparative analytic study is highly relevant to the chosen \nconference stream.  \n \nPURPOSE, QUESTIONS AND METHODS  \nThe purpose of this study is to determine the differences and similarities between the \nunderstandings of HRD/M academics and practitioners about employee engagement to determine \nthe relationship between employee engagement and other well -known constructs s uch as affective \ncommitment, job involvement and organisational citizenship behaviour. In addition, this study \nattempts to determine the uniqueness and importance of employee engagement.  \nThe main research question of this study is “what is employee engagement?” To find answer to this \nquestion, the researcher worked with a sample of 56 individuals (28 HRD/M academics/researchers \nand 28 HRD/M practitioners) using both semi -structured intervi ews and questionnaires as methods \nof data collection and thematic analysis and statistical analysis to analyse the data.  \n \nIMPORTANCE  \nThis study will be of interest to both HRD/M researcher and practitioners in finding a common \nground about the meaning of employee engagement and help address the problem of how to and \nwhat to measure when attempting to build and sustain a high performing engaged workforce. The \ncomparative analysis of perspectives of employee engagement from both academics and \npractitioners will provide data on main components of the concepts and other related constructs.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nThe findings of this study reveal that the understandings of employee engagement from the \nperspectives of both HRD/M researchers and practitioners are similar with strong links to the extant \nliterature. The study concludes that HRD/M researchers and practitioners need to start"

Eversole  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nAn individual’s work status can cause an imbalance with their family life. The reverse may also \nhappen in which obligations within one’s family may impact an employee’s work. The roles assumed \nby these individuals add to the burden of navigating a busy home life and career. Greenhaus and \nBeutell (1985) defined this as conflict. Parenting young childr en, working long hours or a second job, \nmaintaining a marital relationship, and caring for an elderly parent are all example of roles that \ncontribute to the spillover between the two domains.  \n \nIndividuals have a limited amount of resources within each domain and can experience a drain in \none or both domains when the resources are depleted (Frone, 2003; Voydanoff, 2004). Fatigue and \nstrain diminish one’s overall level of satisfaction. Shifts have  occurred in the family structures to \ncreate complex family compositions, leading to an increased awareness of gender roles, trends, and \npatterns. However, women tend to assume more roles, creating the opportunity for conflict to exist. \nPichler (2009) and Tan et al. (2022) found that women experienced more challenges when faced \nwith conflict between the two domains.  \n \nEmployers have recognized the strain amongst employees and have offered programs and \nworkplace policies to promote a more integrated approach to managing work and family \nresponsibilities, attempting to decrease conflict and increase satisfaction within eac h domain. The \npurpose of most programs and policies is to decrease the work and family conflicts among \nemployed parents (Glass & Fujimoto, 1995) while at the same time, decreasing absenteeism and \nimprove productivity (Frone & Yardley, 1996) and increase jo b satisfaction (Terry & Woo, 2021).  \nThompson, et al's. (1999) study found that employees who utilized these types of programs \nreported experiencing significantly less stress in meeting the competing demands of work and \nfamily.  \n \nWork -life literature often includes the concept of balance.  A basic definition of balance used in the \nwork -life literature encompasses emotional, physical, spiritual, and developmental components \n(Haddock, et al., 2001).  However, researchers have struggl ed with the concept because it implies \none can find equal distribution of work and life.  Instead, the word integration is more appropriate.  \nWork should not be separated from life, and it should be recognized as a meaningful and essential \npart of life (Ra poport et al., 2002).  Therefore, work -life should be approached as an integrated \nperspective.  \n \nTheoretical framework  \nThe demands on a job and the availability of resources during a job influence performance.  Like \nGreenhaus and Beutell’s (1985) conflict between work and family domains, job and personal \ndemands can trigger a resource impairment process that leads to undes irable individual outcomes. \nJob Demands -Resource Theory (JD -R) suggested strain is a response to imbalance between \ndemands on employees and the resources they have to deal with those demands can explain \norganizational processes influencing employee health,  well-being, and performance (Bakker & \nDemerouti, 2017). However, instead of focusing solely on the negative outcomes like burnout or \nsickness caused by the presence of job demands and the lack of job resources, JD -R theory includes \nboth negative and posit ive indicators and outcomes of employee well -being. Job resources may \nbuffer the effect of job demands on job strain. JD -R theory proposes reversed causal effects: \nwhereas burned -out employees may create more job demands over time for themselves, engaged \nworkers mobilize their own job resources to stay engaged (Bakker et al, 2023)."

Locke (1978) defined job \nsatisfaction as “a pleasure or positive emotional state resulti ng from the appraisal of one’s job or \njob experiences” (p. 1304). In developing the scale to measure job satisfaction, Brayfield and Rothe \n(1951) focused on the individual's attitude toward their work and building an index to over -all job \nsatisfaction rath er than to specific aspects of a job situation. They stated their scale would elicit an \nexpression of feeling and include items that evoke cooperation from both management and \nemployees, contributing to less conflict.  \n \nPurpose of the Study  \nThe purpose of this student was to examine the relationship between work and family in the lives of \nwomen and how that relationship impacted their job satisfaction. Items from the European Social \nSurvey (ESS II) were used to examine the work - and family -related causes of work -life balance and \nimbalance, and Brayfield and Rothe’s () Job Satisfaction Scale was used to measure the connections \nbetween satisfaction and work/family issues. The following research questions were addressed:  \n \n1. Do resource drains in the work domain impact an employee’s job satisfaction?  \n2. Do resource drains in the family domain impact an employee’s job satisfaction?  \n \nImplications for Practice in HRD  \nWhile extensive research has been conducted to determine the factors that produce or reduce \nconflict between work and family domains, little has been done to identify specific factors that \nproduce enrichment. Human resource professionals should examine the  contrasting tenet within \nthe JD -R model that while job strain develops when job demands are high and when job resources \nare limited, work engagement occurs when job resources are high. This implies human resource \nprofessionals should be watching for high demands within job designs and identify additional \nresources that can be provided to employees. They can review existing policies that offer \nalternatives to employees who experience conflict between the domains of work and family, \nencouraging employees to utilize the programs without fear of retribution within the organization.  \n \nReferences  \nBakker, A.

      "text": "181 \nID:186  - How does a CEO influence TMT employee engagement?  \nWafa Damlaj  & Matthew W Hurtienne  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nPaper’s importance  \nHighly engaged employees, in teams, play a pivotal role in driving an organization’s competitive \nadvantage (Gallup, 2023; Decuypere & Schaufeli, 2021; Shuck & Herd, 2012). And team engagement \nis strongly influenced by leadership —a leader's role accounts fo r at least 70% of the engagement \nvariance (Gallup, 2023; Harter, 2018). An extensive body of literature, comprising over 200 studies, \nhas explored the relationship between leadership and employee engagement, highlighting the \ncorrelation and the direct or i ndirect effects of leadership on employee engagement. Moreover, \nthey found that leaders play an important role in subordinates' employee engagement (Carasco -\nSaul et al., 2015; Bakker & Albrecht, 2018; Li et al., 2021). However, in most of those empirical \nstudies, this relationship is examined within the middle management levels of leadership and not, \nfor instance, at the C -suite leadership level. In the realm of leadership theories, there is a dedicated \nbody of literature that focuses exclusively on C -suite  leadership, commonly referred to as strategic \nleadership, as there are distinctions that exist between leadership and strategic leadership. \nStrategic leadership encompasses individuals such as CEOs and CEOs’ direct reports, referred to as \ntop management t eams (TMTs), including CFOs and CHROs (Finkelstein et al., 2009).  \nIn addition, although research routinely emphasizes the significant influence of the CEO on overall \norganizational outcomes (Hambrick, 2007), a source of research also purports that TMT attributes \nhave the potential to provide a more comprehensive influenc e on organizational objectives \n(Hambrick, 2007; Finkelstein et al., 2009). Moreover, there is compelling evidence that both CEO and \nTMT traits can be contributory to employee engagement (Xu & Thomas, 2011). Yet, little attention \nhas been paid to understand ing the nexus of CEO influence on TMT employee engagement. This \nresearch aims to explore the mechanisms that either promote or hinder TMT employee \nengagement under the influence of a CEO.  \n \nTheoretical Base  \nSocial Exchange Theory is a commonly used framework to analyze and understand employee \nengagement. According to this theory, obligations are created through interactions between parties \nwho are interdependent (Saks and Rotman, 2006). Social Exchange Theory  provides a perspective to \nexplore the expectations of employees from their direct supervisors and other leaders in the \norganization. It also helps to understand how professional relationships develop over time, leading \nto mutual commitment, trust, and loy alty (Cropanzano and Mitchel, 2005, p. 875). The theory \nsuggests that employees tend to be more engaged when they believe that their employer or \nsupervisor will reciprocate by providing positive motivation, leading to a cycle of reciprocal \nrelationships (H urtienne et al., 2021). Hence, Social Exchange Theory is an appropriate framework \nfor studying employee engagement (Saks and Rotman, 2006).  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nOn one hand, the C -suite, positioned at the top of the organizational hierarchy, possesses the \ncapacity and power to significantly influence various organizational outcomes (Finkelstein et al., \n2009). Their decisions play a critical role in determining the ongoing success of the organization \n(Munawaroh et al.,  2021; Hogan & Kaiser, 2005). On the other hand, employee engagement has a \nsignificantly positive correlation with business success at the individual and organizational levels \nand produces multiple successful attributes, including retention, productivity, and profitability (Popli \n& Rizvi, 2016). When examining the relationship between C -suite leadership and employee \nengagement, there is a gap in the research regarding the factors that the CEO impacts TMT"

In the context of the lockdown roadmap, a majority of furloughed \nemployees from skill levels one to three are expected to return to work. However, a distinct \nscenario unfolds for skill level four employees, comprising highly skilled professionals who were \nfurloughed while t heir roles were assumed by non -furloughed colleagues. With the collaboration of \nthe Trades Union Congress (TUC), this project aims to enhance our understanding of the impact of \nthe furlough scheme specifically on skill level four employees. It assesses the  effectiveness of the \nscheme in preserving the jobs of these highly skilled workers, explores any resulting shifts in work \nmethodologies, and investigates opportunities for refining the scheme's design.  \nThe study delves into the extent to which this impact has influenced or will influence the current \nand future strategies of businesses and organizations in managing their furloughed workforce. \nAdditionally, it examines the degree of trade union engagement among skill level four professional \nemployees both before and during the pandemic.

Gonçalves  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nToday, more than ever, new ways of increasing competitiveness in the labor market are being \nsought. One of the ways found to increase this edge over other companies was to bet on the \nworkers and their ability to improve. In this way, they started looking for new fields to invest efforts \nin and thus increase organizations' productivity. With this, fields of study emerged that sought to \nincrease the productivity of companies, paying special attention to individuals and their ability to \nimprove (Lopes et al, 2005), as well as to their happiness and well -being, since they believe that this \nis an added value (Wright, 2003) As a result, new concepts emerged, such as Positive Psychological \nCapital  (PPC) and Work Engagement (WE).  \n \nIt is therefore relevant to understand the relationship between PPC and WE because, as the \nliterature states, work engagement is a predictor of performance.  \nDue to its mission, performance is a central variable in any context, especially in a military \norganization. This was highlighted by Chambel et al. (2019), who concluded that it is crucial to study \nthe effects of WE on military behaviors, as well as on the ir performance.  \nIn the organizational behavior literature, perceived performance has been conceptualized with the \nfollowing dimensions, task performance, contextual performance and counterproductive work \nbehaviors. These three types of perceived performance appear in 1990  with Campbell, who defines \nthem as actions that contribute to the achievement of a company’s objectives, the so -called \nIndividual Work Performance (IWP).  \n \nWith this work, we intend to study the relationship between positive psychological capital and the \nperceived performance of students at the Portuguese Air Force Academy (PoAFA), with WE playing a \nfundamental role as a mediating variable. It is therefore as sumed that PPC is decisive for a \npsychological state of energy, enthusiasm, and involvement in study, which is reflected in better \ntask and contextual performance and less counterproductive WE in the military students. Based on \nthese concepts, the followin g Research Question becomes pertinent:  \n\"What is the influence of Positive Psychological Capital on the perceived performance of Air Force \nAcademy students?\"  \n \nA cross -sectional correlational study was conducted with a quantitative methodology, through a \nquestionnaire survey. The sample consisted of 242 students of the PoAFA. To carry out data \nprocessing, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) ver sion 28.0 platform was used.  \nInitially, the psychometric qualities of the measuring instruments were analyzed. Descriptive \nanalyzes of the variables under study were then carried out. Finally, the correlational analysis was \ncarried out, as well as the analysis of mediation hypotheses,  using the Process v3.1 macro tool. As a \ncomplement, mean difference tests were also carried out to analyze the hypothesis of significant \ndifferences between specialty, position and gender among PoAFA students.  \nResults confirmed the existence of a positive and significant relation between PPC and WE with IWP. \nRegarding the three components of individual work performance,  there was a positive and \nsignificant relation between PPC and WE with task and contextual pe rformance, and negative and \nsignificant with counterproductive work behaviors.  \n \nit was possible to confirm that WE plays an important role in the relationship between PPC and IWP."

It involves addressing new transformative dynamics based on an economy of \ninnovative, unique, differentiating and val ue-creating projects, designed to achieve and manage \nbenefits not only for the organization but for the entire ecosystem in which it operates because it \ndevelops solutions to real, complex problems that promote the ESRS. The lack of knowledge, \ncomplexity a nd novelty of the problem is at the heart of it, manifested in complex interactions, in \nwhich the relationship between the experience of the client's dimensions has a relevant role and \ncontribution, which is decisive in getting to know the deep, hidden lay ers of the problem's iceberg, \nwhich requires new approaches that the classic, rational and linear management approach is \nunable to provide. The value of interaction is reflected in the innovation strategy, which addresses \nproblem -solving and consists of fo ur stages: identifying and defining the problem, analyzing the \nproblem, prioritizing the solution, and implementing the solution. The value of the solution comes \nfrom the biggest challenge, Problem Finding is the first and most important stage of this proc ess, \nthe beginning of value creation, which is established by correctly identifying and defining the \nproblem, based on real facts, and the scientific method in analyzing the root cause.

Is it time to manage this with practical \nHRM support?  \n \nNeil Beasley, Madeline Stevens  & Hannah Wilson  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThe intuitive responses of UK employees to sycophantic behaviour being exhibited within the \nworkplace. Is it time to manage this with practical HRM support?  \nThe definition of ingratiation, is that of a behavioural act of trying to please a target by deeds, \ncompliments or actions (Jones, 1964). When one is sycophantic, these deeds and actions are \ndeemed insincere, deceptive or manipulative (Carlson, 2012). However, when one excl usively \ningratiates upwards to senior colleagues or people of influence, the insincerity and manipulative \nnature of the actions can be indistinguishable from sycophancy (Turnley & Bolino, 2001). The act of \nexclusively ingratiating upwards or exhibiting syc ophantic behaviour in UK workplaces, has been \nresearched by conducting semi -structured interviews in accordance with a pragmatic qualitative \nmethodology, underpinned by a framework based upon the cognitive dissonance theory (Zou et al., \n2020). The purpose of this research is unique in the fact that it considers the following question;  \nWould it be beneficial to the workforce, to manage, investigate and where required conduct \ndisciplinary proceedings of this deviant branch of impression management? This question is the \nmain focus of the research which has generated the following objective s: \n \n• To investigate if the act of exclusively upwards ingratiation affects civility between \ncolleagues within workplaces;  \n• To understand if the act of individuals exclusively ingratiating upwards, effects the morale of \nemployees in an organisation;  \n• To investigate if employees in UK workplaces, think that sycophantic acts that are \ndetrimental to others in the workplace, should be tolerated without consequences or think \nthat such cases should be classified as misconduct and treated accordingly.  \n \nThis research has highlighted the negative effects of sycophantic behaviour and exclusively \ningratiating upwards has on the workplace. One participant, highlighted the effect on teamwork, \nsycophantic behaviour, can have within the workplace. ‘Sycophancy me ans raising yourself in \nsomebody's esteem at the expense of somebody else, on the ladder. And so… it's going to impact \nupon on the ability to be part of a team.’ On the issue of managing these behavioural traits via an \nHRM process, a comparison to another behaviour already managed by HRM professionals is \nproffered.  ‘Sycophantic behaviour… is coming into the same category as bullying. And it's hard \nsometimes, especially with bullying and sycophantic behaviour, because you are dealing with… \npeople that are m anipulative, and manipulating people are quite charismatic. And when you're \ncharismatic, you're more believable.’ Another participant was more explicit on this same subject \nmatter stating ‘sycophancy is a small behaviour which is indicative of a bigger pro blem and it needs \nto be addressed.’ These findings have also been franked by existing impression management \nliterature (Vonk, 1998; Deluga, 2004, Kim, LePine and Chun, 2018, Klotz et al., 2018).  \n \nThe implications of this research, if realised, means HRM professionals would be educated to see \nthe signs of when people are using the deviant side of ingratiation.  And in the process the \nworkplace should become a fairer, more balanced place for everyone  concerned. Most stakeholders \nwithin a company should feel the positive effects of the implementation of appropriate guidance"

As AI is advancing and being \nincorporated into firms, there is the constant need for w orkers to keep up with technological pace \nand the addition of these AI technologies in operations (Fleming, 2020; Zirar, Ali and Islam, 2023). \nThese additions of these technologies tend to have some effects employees on wellbeing when \nworking alongside the se technologies (Selenko et al., 2022). (Chowdhury et al., 2022) stipulates how \ndifficult it is for organizations to integrate AI and workers. Further, a cognitive survey by Deloitte \nindicated that 47% of the respondents found it difficult to integrate the se technologies with existing \nprocesses . The research explored how HR can better support employee wellbeing by providing rich \ninsight into the human impacts of AI to inform better HR policies, training, and employee support \nsystems.  \n \nTheoretical Foundations  \nEmployee wellbeing is essential in the carrying employee tasks (Adams, 2019). When employees \nhave good health they can be productive and carry on their roles. The job -demands -resources (JD -R) \ntheory by Bakker and his co -authors (Demerouti et al., 2001) is employed in this study to analyse AI \nsystems impacts on workers. They propose 2 broad categories of working conditions: job demands \nand job resources. (Demerouti et al., 2001) state job demands as the “physical, psychological, social, \nor organizational asp ects of the job that require sustained physical and/or psychological (cognitive \nand emotional) effort or skills and are therefore associated with certain physiological and/or \npsychological costs”. Whereas Job resources are “those physical, psychological, s ocial, or \norganizational aspects of the job that are functional in achieving work goals, reducing job demands \nand the associated physiological and psychological costs, and stimulating personal growth, learning, \nand development”. The study relies on this mo del to explain that human -AI collaboration put some \nstrain or demand on workers that needs to be identified and the appropriate job resources made \navailable for workers; as illustrated by (Mäkikangas et al., 2021) the job resources are those \nresources that  help individuals deal with the demands of their jobs.  \n \nResearch Design  \nThe research design is qualitative in nature. Qualitative design helps us derive rich insights into the \nphenomenon at hand. The philosophical paradigm employed in the research is the interpretivist \napproach. The interpretivist approach focuses on how human s make sense of the world (Saunders \net. al, 2009).   \n \nPopulation, Sample & Sampling Technique  \nThe target population is the UK this is because of how advanced the country is in digital \ntransformation, previous research identified the UK as the digital capital of Europe (Hathaway, \nBailey and Cilauro, 2017). A purposeful sampling technique based on cr iterion sampling was \nutilised. The unit of analysis were individuals of a company that uses AI systems in their operations \nspecifically in the logistics industry. The criteria used for sample selection included individuals based"

Individuals were contacted \nthrough WhatsApp and emails. The participants were identified from social media platforms like \nLinkedIn, company websites and researcher contacts. The interviews were conducted on Microsoft \nTeams. The interviews were recorded and transcribed and lasted for an hour.  \n \nData Analysis  \nThematic analysis is being used to identify themes and trends in the data. NVivo software is being \nused to analyse the data. The data is being analysed as the data is being collected, which the \nqualitative method lends itself to. The goal of the analysis w ill be to identify patterns and trends in \nthe data (Edmondson and Mcmanus, 2007).  \n \nPreliminary Results  \nThe current preliminary results suggests that while AI provides more flexibility for employees, it also \ncreates pressure to constantly be productive. Employees feel their \"antennas are always up\" and \nthey have little time to rest. This highlights the need for HR to balance technology use with \nemployee wellbeing. The study also highlights the static and monotonous nature when interacting \nwith robots and other AI systems. In instances, where there was less human interaction this posed a \nstrain on employee men tal wellbeing and satisfaction levels. The study further shows how AI is \nautomating certain HR processes like leave approvals which increases efficiency and allows HR to \nfocus on more strategic priorities. The research also demonstrated how AI is being use d to track \nproductivity and performance. The technology records employee activities, withdrawals, breaks etc. \nThis allows HR and managers to monitor staff more closely which could also potentially have \nnegative impacts on employee wellbeing.  \n \nConclusion  \nOverall, this study provides a qualitative view into how the increasing use of AI is impacting \nemployee overall wellbeing when collaborating with AI systems. The research calls for organizations \nto properly train staff to leverage AI and technology develop ers to augment the technology while \nsupporting health, wellbeing and development. When employers and companies are aware of the \nimpact AI has on staff wellbeing companies would be able to properly train and develop their \nhuman resource and adjust how these  technologies function to be able to recoup maximum \nbenefits and ensure staff are healthy to perform their roles.  \n \nKeywords:  artificial intelligence, staff wellbeing, human resource development, tandem"

As more people are getting higher educati on, the job market has \nbecome more competitive, leading to individuals being employed in positions that do not match \ntheir qualifications. As such, perceived overqualification is a widespread phenomenon in the global \nworkplace. Moreover, the COVID -19 pande mic and associated economic downturn have concerning \nimplications for the labor market, especially in nations with high unemployment rates. As a result, \nenhancing our understanding of employee reactions to this phenomenon is crucial not only in the \nWest bu t also in other parts of the world. In literature, overqualification can be described as either \nobjective or subjective. It is argued that perceived overqualification (POQ) is a better measure of \noverqualification than objective measures because of two key  points. First, POQ captures the \npersonal experiences of overqualified employees better than objective overqualification. Second, \nthe indicators used to assess objective overqualification fail to capture the differences between \npositions with the same name . Therefore, this study focuses on a subjective measure of \noverqualification known as POQ.  \n \nPrevious studies have mostly focused on negative work attitudes and behaviors resulting from \nperceived overqualified, such as job burnout, turnover, counterproductive work behavior, and job \nsearching. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that employees who feel overqualified may \npositively view their redundant skills and use them to proactively produce positive work outcomes. \nMoreover, there is limited research on the mediators between POQ and employee outcomes as well \nas boundary conditions that can mit igate or enhance the effects of POQ. Therefore, this study \ninvestigates the double -edged sword effects of perceived overqualification with the mediating role \nof self -efficacy and the moderating role of transformational leadership. In terms of variable \noutc omes, this study specifically focuses on turnover intention as a dark side and innovative work \nbehaviors as a bright side. The data of 468 voluntary respondents working in various industries in \nVietnam were analyzed with partial least squares structural eq uation modeling (PLS -SEM) to \nevaluate the assessment measurement model and test the proposed hypotheses. The results \nindicated that self -efficacy mediates the negative relationship between POQ and turnover intention \nas well as the positive relationship bet ween POQ and innovative work behaviors. Besides, this study \nalso highlights the role of transformational leadership as boundary conditions in the two side \neffects of POQ on turnover intention and innovative work behaviors. Particularly, transformational \nleadership moderates the perceived overqualification -turnover intention association such that this \nrelationship will be stronger with a high level of transformational leadership rather than a low one. \nMeanwhile, the positive relationship between POQ and inno vative work behaviors will be stronger \nwith a high level of transformational leadership rather than a low one. Finally, this study significantly \ncontributes to the growing body of knowledge on both the dark side and bright side of perceived \noverqualificati on in developing countries.  \n \nKeywords:  perceived overqualification, self -efficacy, transformational leadership, turnover \nintention, innovative work behavior"

Previous policy analysis and survey research highlights that the \nimage of manufacturing work and jobs are problems to be ‘fixed’ in post -industrial economies such \nas the U K and US, and that the older industrial legacy/image of the sector makes these jobs less \ndesirable to jobseekers. However, the adoption of new manufacturing digital technologies and the \nneed for greater workforce digital skills may help address some of the  negative images associated \nwith working in the sector and offer better job quality. This should help manufacturers better \ncompete for emerging Gen Z talent and extend their reach into under -represented groups such as \nwomen and minorities. This paper repor ts new primary survey data to better understand public \nperceptions of the UK manufacturing sector and jobs, what factors shape these views and how \nindustry stakeholders can better engage under -represented groups such as women in the industry  \n \nTheoretical base  \nThe paper draws on a range of concepts but is largely theoretically based within the literature on \njob quality. The latter refers to the job attributes that contributes to, or detracts from, workers’ well -\nbeing (Muñoz de Bustillo et al 2011). Job quality i s of course multidimensional and overlaps with \nrelated concepts such as ‘good’ or ‘decent’ jobs and ‘fair work’ (e.g. Findlay 2016, Findlay et al 2017). \nAlthough there is no single accepted definition of job quality, Findlay (2016) argues for a focus on \nemployment quality (pay and employment terms), job or task quality (skills utilisation, pace, \nautonomy, control, problem -solving and opportunities for learning) and workplace quality \n(opportunity, voice and respect).  Warhurst et al (2017) provide an overlap ping definition, identifying \nsix key dimensions of job quality: pay and rewards; intrinsic objective (e.g. skills, autonomy, and \ncontrol) and subjective (e.g. effort, fulfilment) characteristics; terms of employment (e.g. contractual \nsecurity, career devel opment); health and safety; work -life balance (e.g. flexibility); and \nrepresentation and voice. Our survey looks at what people value in jobs, the images they associate \nwith manufacturing work (and jobs) and the relative attraction of the sector as a caree r pathway in \nthe context of emerging new digital technologies. Our survey measures what people value in \nchoosing a new job, how this compares to what they think of work in manufacturing and how new \ntechnologies may help change work and careers in the secto r.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThis paper seeks to explore the perceived importance and image of UK manufacturing in the post -\nindustrial UK economy as a career destination for jobseekers. We present a high -level analysis of \nsurvey responses from a representative sample of 2,107 people a cross the UK. We find that while \npeople strongly value the contribution of the sector (for the continuous supply of goods, innovation, \nand future prosperity), views on manufacturing work and jobs are strongly shaped by proximity and \nfamiliarity: the closer  people are connected to the sector (either directly through their work or social \nnetworks), the more positive they are about job quality and how new technologies will change \nfuture jobs and careers. Despite this and because the sector must better attract talent from under -\nrepresented groups, we discuss what women think of manufacturing work and what the sector has \nto do to make it more attractive to this demographic in terms of greater flexibility practices and \ninclusive workspaces."

This study \naims to identify the most beneficial work design configur ations in terms of fostering employees' \nwork -life balance (WLB) across different forms of work. Research has recognized the strategic value \nof work -life balance programs in promoting employee retention, minimizing costs associated with \nturnover, and reduci ng absenteeism (Eby et al., 2005; Hyman & Summers, 2004). In addition to \nthese established factors, our study sheds light on another way to improve WLB. In particular, work \ndesign emerges as an important determinant that can influence WLB, although the imp act varies \nacross forms of work. It attempts to solve the practice -relevant problem of designing the work \nconfiguration that is most beneficial for WLB within a particular form of work and the theory -\nrelevant problem of traditional work design theories tha t need to be modernised to fit the \ntechnologically advanced new work environments. The study corresponds to some suggestions \nfrom previous studies (e.g., Chan et al., 2023; Chatterjee et al., 2021) by complementing previous \nresearch on WLB by exploring the  phenomenon through the lens of work design.  \n \nOur results suggest that work design impact on WLB matters most for on -site workers, followed by \nhybrid workers and, to a lesser extent, remote workers. These findings underscore the importance \nof considering work design as one of the factors in promoting optimal WLB outcomes. Chan and \ncolleagues (2023) suggested many recommendations for individual -level HR recommendations (e.g., \nbuilding employee resilience), team - or organisational -level HR recommendations (e.g., building a \ncompassionate and supportive wo rkplace culture), and socio - or governmental -level HR \nrecommendations (e.g., reforming existing legislation relating to flexible working). With our study, \nwe complement their research and provide recommendations for team - or organisational -level HR \nstrateg ies while examining the potential impact of job design on WLB, focusing specifically on \ndifferent forms of work. We do this by providing specific configurations that are most beneficial for \nWLB for each form of work.  \n \nBy integrating job design with new information and communication technology (ICT) characteristics, \nthe paper aims to provide insights for optimising work design in technologically advanced work \nenvironments. For that, we designed two studies. The first stu dy data were collected from 605 \nrespondents in France between November and December 2022, while the second study data were \ncollected from 1535 respondents in Montenegro in May 2023. By applying fuzzy -set qualitative \ncomparative analysis (fsQCA), our study takes a holistic approach to work design configurations. The \nanalysis of variance showed that workers who work in hybrid work environments generally have the \nhighest WLB, followed by remote employees and onsite workers. Further, the fsQCA analysis \nsuggests  that work design is important for WLB across all work forms, but it appears to be most \nsalient for on -site work, followed by hybrid and then remote work. In addition, a necessity analysis \nreveals common work design requirements for all work forms, highlig hting the gravity of \ninformation processing, task variety, and social support. Task variety is critical for on -site and \nremote work, while IT presenteeism emerges as an important factor for hybrid work. The second \nstudy's findings contribute to a comprehen sive work design framework that promotes WLB in \ndifferent work arrangements.

The study results indicate that \nenriched work design holds promise for improving work -life ba lance across all three forms of work. \nHowever, it is noteworthy that job complexity and technological complexity show an \ninterchangeable effect, suggesting that it is important to focus on one of the two components to \navoid overwhelming employees with exce ssive demands.

The findings of \nthis study will contribute to a better understanding of gender diversity in  leadership roles and may \nhelp specify the most effective initiatives to promote gender equity and inclusion in corporate \ngovernance and the workplace in Morocco.  \n \nThe Underrepresentation of women on corporate boards is global phenomenon (Catalyst, 2021). \nMorocco like other countries is still grappling with this challenge despite its commendable strides in \nrecent years to foster gender equality and equal opportunitie s in corporate governance. In fact, the \nprogress made in this domain is still slow and the disparity is stark in upper managerial positions, \nwhere a mere 5.40% of women currently occupy roles, indicating significant gender gap. \nFurthermore, the ownership o f international businesses by women in Morocco stands at a meager \n2.5%, highlighting the pressing need for enhanced support systems and increased opportunities for \nwomen entrepreneurs (WEF, 2023).  \n \nAs part of its efforts to enhance women’s representation on boards, Morocco mandated a quota of \n30% for women on publicly traded limited companies’ boards by 2024. This percentage is set to \nincrease to 40% by 2027 (International Finance Corporation, 2022).  Nevertheless, it is currently hard \nto tell whether this compulsory quota system could accelerate the effective participation of women \nin corporate governance.    \n \nSince there is a scant body of literature on women on boards in Morocco, we decided to conduct \nthis qualitative study that relies on storytelling to uncover women’s experiences in corporate \nboardrooms as well as their opinions, emotions, and perceptions of  gender equity and inclusion in \nthe realms of organizational, social, and economic life. The choice of storytelling as a research \nmethod is justified by the urgency of creating a relational space where stories can unfold safely and \nsoftly in a culture mark ed by an oral tradition and known for the need of women to share their tales \nand confide to each other to relieve themselves and find solutions to their pressing problems as \nthey engage in the act of storytelling. Our sample is composed of a carefully sele cted group of \nwomen (20) who are members of the \"Club des femmes administratrices d'entreprises\" (Club of \nWomen on Corporate Boards). By eliciting and sharing these stories, we aspire to contribute \nmeaningfully to the ongoing discourse on gender diversity and inclusion in Moroccan corporations, \nultimately fostering a more inclusive and equitable business environment.  \n \nWe also seek to provide a robust analysis of women’s experiences and opinions that will inform DEI \n(diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies and practices in Morocco and contribute to enhancing the \nimpact of women in corporate governance structures as we ll as the C -Suites.  \n \nThis study makes three key contributions. First, it validates and affirms the personal story of every \nwoman participant resulting in a reinforced sense of self, a high self -efficacy and self -confidence. \nParticipants may find the storytelling process therap eutic, gaining insights into their own lives and \nvalues and leading to a heightened self -awareness.

Qatarisation aims to place knowledgeable local Qataris \ninto senior professional roles to lead their country. Human Devel opment is a core pillar of the \nNational Vision and is an expected responsibility of each organisation and its employees. This \nresponsibility directly impacts the Human Resource Management (HRM) function and HRM \nprofessionals developing talent in Qatar. Thi s is a challenge due to a lack of Qatar -centric \nframeworks available to HR Professionals practising in Qatar and a lack of understanding of \ninfluences on HRM Practises. The research focused on overcoming this challenge and contributing \nto a sustainable fra mework solution for HR professionals in Qatar.  \nThere were three main aims; to review HR literature while exploring the fundamental principles and \ncontext of the HR professional practise in Qatar; to explore ways HR practitioners in the Qatar HR \nForum could drive and support a change in HRM practise, an d to contribute to professionalising \nHRM Practise in Qatar. A qualitative interpretivistic approach explored the experiences and \nperceptions of HR professionals practising in Qatar, who are members of the Qatar HR Forum, \nthrough surveys, interviews, and fo cus groups, to understand the complexities of HRM in Qatar.  \n  \nThe findings show that distinctive expatriate and Qatari influences need to be considered with a \nnew framing of how Qatari culture might influence and impact current and future HRM practises. \nThis has been conceptualised as ‘Tharaba Culture’ – ذرابه ,which encompasses behaviours, customs, \nand unwritten expectations that locals acknowledge as their culture. It is based on influences such \nas family ties, leadership status, expected norms and non -negotiable behaviours, engulfed in the \nwisdom of the resp ected e lders formulated from tribal descent.

Green space can also impact a person’s \noverall health, another benefit for organizations (Kondo et al., 2018).  However, little research has \nbeen conducted to understand how the frequency and length of time spent in green space can \ninfluence job satisfaction. Th is study aims to understand the relationship between job satisfaction \nand time spent in green spaces during work. As green spaces are becoming more popular globally, \ntheir creation and successful management may be crucial to Japan, the world’s third -larges t \neconomy (Adebayo & Kirikkaleli, 2021). While green spaces often fall on cities to fund, the financial \nburden of the creation and management of these spaces is extremely pronounced in Japan because \ndemographic trends of aging and depopulation are decreasi ng the tax base for municipalities \nthroughout the country (Rupprecht, 2017), causing the responsibility of these faces to fall on \norganizations. Japan is one of the top ten most green and sustainable countries in the world and is \ncurrently working towards having at least 50% of new cars produced with zero emissions, meeting a \ngoal of 100% carbon emission -free by 2050 in major cities, and is considered to have one of the best \nrecycling systems in the world (Berry, 2021). The successful implementation of gree n spaces in \norganizations will only amplify Japan’s environmental commitment.  \n \n• RQ1: Will employees feel greater job satisfaction when they have access to green space at \nwork?  \n• RQ2: Do employees believe the length of time spent in green spaces influences the effect it \nhas on job satisfaction?  \n \nOver 200 city employees located in two cities in Japan participated in this study, which utilized the \nJob Satisfaction Survey 36 item, nine -facet scale to assess employee attitudes about the job and \naspects of the job created by John Spector in 1985.  \n \nMethod  \n \nThis study utilizes a survey designed to investigate the relationship between green space at work, \njob satisfaction, and whether the amount of time spent in green space is a mediating factor in their \nrelationship. Descriptive statistics and regression anal ysis via SPSS are being conducted to analyze \nresults, and findings will be interpreted to discuss the implications of the results.  \n \nReferences  \n \nAdebayo, T.

Strong legal \npunishment applies to the employers who do not respond to workplace bullying claims (upto 5 \nyears sentences or fines of 50 million KRW). On the positive side, the  legislation raised awareness \non workplace bullying itself. However, the increasing managerial expedients and false claims are \nover -shadowing the positive effect of anti -workplace bullying legisaltion and the legilsation has \nbecome a cause of chaos in Kore an workplace. The paper will review the relevant literature and \naddress the reason behind the chaos. It will then explain the types of expedients employed by the \nmanagement and motives of false claims.  \nOne reason for the managerial expedients lies in that the enactment of anti -workplace bullying \nlegislation did not accompany employer consensus or sense of responsibility. Despite the legal \nchange, many Korean employers still consider workplace bullying an  individual matter, not \nsomething that should be addressed by the management. Instead of abiding by the law, Korean \nemployers and management have opted for various expedients to minimize their responsibilities \nand involvement in workplace bullying claims. From supressing/ignoring workplace bullying claims \nto protecting perpetrators, their expedients manifest at all stage of workplace bullying claims \nmanagement. The anti -workplace bullying legislation contains an article about employer \npunishment for such ex pedients but the punishment can only occur when an employee reports it. \nKorean employees are usually avoidant of reporting the management or employer in fear of \nretaliation.  \n \nThe reasons for rising false claims lies in that that the legal enactment also did not accompany \nenhanced employees’ ethics and that Korean leglsation does not mention duration/frequency \ncriteria for bullying. Some Korean workers have been wrongly educated  that when they feel \nsomething is bullying, then it is bullying. Resultantly, some of them began filing a claim against a \nsingle incidence of ordinary managerial behavior and demand reimbursement. Soon, false claims of \nbullying became an issue in which the  claimant uses the claim as a means to gain(money, renewal \nof work contract, undeserved credits for work, heightened performance grade and etc.). In 2023 \nsurvey, 1.4% of Korean workers responded that they have been the victims of false bullying claims. \nThe figure was particularly high among the people in their 30s (2.3%) and 20s (1.5%). Another 1.6% \nwere threatended with the possibility of false bullying claims. The figure was much higher for \nwomen (2.3%) than for men (0.8%). Employers also began utilising false claims as a means to drive \nout employees who act out to protect employees’ rights (e.g,, union members).  \nThe case of South Korea shows how enacting a new legislation could create a societal chaos when \nthe interested parties were not prepared for the legal changes. Creating consensus and raising \nethics should preced the enactment of new legislation.  \n \nKeywords:  South Korea, workplace bullying, anti -workplace bullying legislation, increasing false \nclaims, managerial expediencyincreasing"

In addition, \nand in line with a trend in Human Resource Management (HRM) more generally, HRD professionals \nhave experienced increasi ng devolvement of HRD functions to line and operational managers as \nwell as increasing use of outsourced providers of HRD services (Garavan et al, 2020). These factors \ntaken together have raised questions about the strategic role of the HRD function and of  HRD \nprofessionals in work organisations (Mitsakis, 2019; Gold et al, 2022).  \n \nTheoretical Base  \nThe symposium applies the concept of role to examine the strategic contribution or otherwise of \nHRD/M professionals. This concept has been widely used to study the contribution of both HRM and \nHRD to organisation success for many years (e.g., Storey, 1992;  Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005; \nMcLagan, 1989; Garavan et al, 2020). Drawing on an analysis of well -established role theories from \nsociology and social psychology we apply this concept together with that of strategic HRD to analyse \nthe roles of HRD/M professi onals in North America, Europe, Asia -Pacific, and the Middle East/North \nAfrica. This almost global representation and the comparative nature of the study is highly relevant \nto the selected conference stream.  \n \nPurpose, Questions and Methods  \nThe main purpose of the symposium is to stimulate debate on reasons for failure of HRD \nprofessionals to achieve a strategic role in work organisations. Questions to be addressed are:  \n \n1-Does success in achieving a strategic role for HRD professionals vary across four global regions?  \n2-What factors might explain the lack of strategic role for HRD professionals?  \n \nThe symposium contributions will draw on the findings of recent research examining HRD roles in \nthe USA, UK and the Netherlands reported in Lundgren et al, (2023). This will be supplemented by \nrecent reports of international surveys conducted by the UK Cha rtered Institute of Personnel and \nDevelopment (Peters, 2023; Overton, 2023).   \n \nThe symposium organisers will provide short presentations on the findings from these research \nprojects and provocative statements on possible causes for a lack of strategic role for HRD \nprofessionals. These possible causes will include:  \n \n1-Higher and professional education of both HRD and non -HRD managers  \n2-Digitalization of organising  \n3-National and organisational cultures  \n4-Lack of evidence base for HRD policies and practice adopted by HRD professionals  \n \nWe request a session of 90 minutes for the symposium."

Fitzgerald (2014) \nsees talent as exceptional performers who surpass expectations. Numerous studies highlight the \nAfrican perspective lagging, with Western dominance (Fornes & Mendez, 2018; Reisen, 2015).  \nAdditionally, African leadership, per Mbigi (2002), centers on culture. April and Peters (2011) studied \nAfrocentric paradigms emphasizing collectivism in traditional societies. Perkins, Shirley, Wint (2008) \nand Hanges, Aiken, Park, and Su (2016) explored l eadership through the lens of cultural diversity \nand cross -culture, highlighting the influential role of leaders in politics, the economy, and social \naspects, serving as catalysts for change through their capacity to influence others.  \nThe African worldview, rooted in Ubuntu philosophy, emphasizes belonging, as seen in the Zulu \nproverb \"umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu.\" Conversely, Western and Northern perspectives favor \nindividualism, emphasizing competitiveness and sustainability (April & Eph raim, 2010; Mbigi, 2002, \nMbigi, 2007, Mbigi & Maree, 2014). Japanese and Eastern societies also prioritize collectivism. \nDespite modernization's social changes, traditional African norms underpinning leadership remain \nslow to adapt.  \n \nSuccession planning should integrate with talent management (Rothwell, 2010). Talent scarcity is \nuniversal, impacting both developed and developing nations (Rothwell, 2010). Africa faces acute \ntalent scarcity due to significant brain drain (Docquier, 2017) . \n \nTheoretical base  \nThe researcher chose a qualitative method to explore the topic thoroughly, encourage \ntransparency, and capture participants' experiences and insights.  \nThe study centred on tribal councils in South Africa's North -West Province, specifically in Ngaka \nModiri Molema, Bojanala, and Dr. Ruth Segomotsi Mompati districts, focusing on rural areas where \nthese councils are located.  \n \nAfrica boasts diverse ethnic groups and tribes, each with unique cultures, languages, traditions, and \nsocial structures (Harahap, 2023). This diversity can lead to issues like xenophobia, tribalism, racism, \nand is compounded by the fourth industrial revolu tion with technologies like artificial intelligence \nand digitalization.  \n \nAccording to James & Mathew (2012), effective strategies counteract turnover and promote \nretention (Kaye & Jordan -Evans, 2000; Hytter, 2006). Attractive strategies encompass employee \nengagement, upward mobility, recognition, Performance Appraisal (PA), car eer development, \nmotivation, and competitive pay (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014; Dockel, Basson, & Coetzee, 2006; \nHytter, 2006). Talent attraction and retention add value to the organisation.  \n \nTalent retention counteracts the intention to quit. Talent in the organisation is perceived as \nindividuals with human capital in the form of skills, ability and knowledge (Born & Heer, 2009; \nCappelli, 2008). Furthermore, it entails the ability to learn and  grow within the same organisation \n(Dittmar, 2012)."

The involvement of the tribal leaders and the communities’ members into decision \nmaking fosters the local language, tribal language, cultural  values and ownership of the projects and \nprogrammes for sustainable development for the benefits of the communities but taking into \nconsideration the ethical imperatives. Inclusion allows everyone to comment irrespective of race, \ngender, and status (Ranad el et al., 2018; Roberson & Perry, 2021,). Hence, it promotes gender \nequality and equity. The inclusive leader embraces change (Gotsis & Grimani, 2017). Furthermore, \nan inclusive leader promotes an inclusive organisational culture.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThe researcher aimed to enhance the talent management field by crafting a talent management \nframework rooted in African tribal leadership principles. This study is expected to highlight \nfacilitating factors for talent development and retention in the chose n area. Unlike existing talent \nmanagement frameworks, which typically originate from a Western standpoint and focus on single \ndimensions, this research seeks to integrate the tribal leadership perspective.  \nThe Western perspective often draws from Western culture and experiences, which may not fully \nalign with developing countries (Simmonds, 2013). This study's value is multifaceted. The talent \nmanagement framework developed under traditional authorities can inform national policy, \nguideline, and strategy development, promoting transformation, system enhancement, and \nstructural progress. It can establish a governance structure, such as a board of directors, for talent \nmanagement under tribal authorities, in li ne with the mandate of cooperative governance to \ncontribute to organizational value.  \n \nThis inductive phenomenological qualitative study followed the social constructivism paradigm. \nData was collected in the form of focus group discussion using a designed interview guide with a \nstructured questionnaire. Hundred and four participants were interviewed from the tribal \nauthorities including the Human Resource Practitioners from Cooperative Governance for \nTraditional Affairs. Da ta from group discussion were analysed using the thematic analysis \ntechnique. Four themes were generated from data collected. The study findings indicated that \ndevelopment of a talent management framework should be prioritised since there is no framework \nnow. The participants indicated that the framework would serve as a source of reference for future \ngenerations. The contribution made to the body of knowledge was the development of a talent \nmanagement framework for tribal leaders in the selected villages o f the North -West Province.  \nThe researcher also conducted a comprehensive review using various search engines, including \nSABINET, EBSCO HOST, EMERALD research database, and Google Scholar. The examination of \narticles and theses related to talent management from diverse perspectives r evealed a dearth of \nresearch on the African perspective concerning talent management under tribal authorities. This \nscarcity led to the selection of this topic for exploratory research.  \n \nResearch Question  \n• How do African Leaders perceive talent management?  \n• How effective is attraction and retention of talent from an African tribal leadership \nperspective?  \n• What are the complexities of talent attraction and retention from an African tribal \nleadership perspective?  \n \nImplications for practice:  \nThe framework will be shared with the house of traditional leaders for implementation and with the \nrelevant department as a guiding tool and reference source. Furthermore, the relevant department \nwill oversee monitoring and evaluation to assess the framewo rk's impact.

As \nMoroccan companies are becoming progressively aware of the importance of talent retention in \nimproving effectiveness, productivity, and organizational capability, digitalization can act a s an asset \nto enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of talent retention strategies (Habachi et al., 2022).  \nRetention is defined as the efforts made by employers to keep talented employees to achieve \nspecific objectives (Frank, 2004; Ibrahim and Daniel, 2018). In Morocco, a significant concern \nplaguing companies pertains to the difficulty in retaining top employ ees long -term (Hajjami, 2020; \nIddoub and Barzi, 2023). Approximately 50% of Moroccan talent are willing to switch careers and \nwork in another country (Hajjami, 2020). The lack of advancement opportunities and enhanced \nquality of life, as well as an unpredi ctable work environment, contribute to the issue of turnover \n(Ongori, 2007; Al -Suraihi et al., 2021).  \n \nWhile there have been studies exploring this matter (e.g., Habachi et al., 2022; Ford -Colin, 2022), \nlittle research has been conducted to investigate the key agents of employee turnover and inform \nactionable strategies that could potentially be implemented  by organizations, especially in the \ncontext of Morocco. Effective talent retention strategies can ensure better productivity and \nenhanced effectiveness (Al Mamun and Hasan, 2017). Therefore, making sense of the specific \ncontextual agents affecting talent retention is relevant for Moroccan companies to design stronger \nHR strategies.  \n \nBy conducting a thorough analysis, this research is aimed at investigating the company’s talent \nretention practice to offer valuable insight into the factors impacting talent retention and the \neffectiveness of established strategies within the company. We opted to use the Psychological \nContract Theory (PCT) as a theoretical framework to guide this study. The psychological contract \nassesses the mutual relationship between employees’ obligations, duties, and right s, as well as \nthose of the employer (Silva and Weerasinghe, 2016; Okolie and Memeh, 2022). The research \nquestions are the following: 1) What are the talent retention strategies in the organization? 2) What \nare the factors negatively affecting talent retent ion? 3) How do digital tools support talent retention?  \nQualitative research is suitable for extracting insights on unexplored topics (Creswell, 2016). On the \nbasis of purposeful sampling, this research targets 20 -25 employees and HRD practitioners working \nat the Moroccan company. The data will be gathered via semi -structured interviews and a review of \ndocumentation related to talent retention. The data will then be analyzed through a thematic \nanalysis to uncover key insights following the seven phases of thematic analysis proposed by Lester \net al. (2020).  \n \nBy tackling the unique challenges the company faces in regard to talent retention, this study can \nprovide actionable insight that could be implemented in a broader fashion throughout the \nMoroccan business environment. Furthermore, this research can contribute to the HRD field by \nproviding a nuanced understanding of employee retention strategies within a specific \norganizational and cultural context.  \n \nKeywords:  Talent retention, Morocco, Psychological Contract Theory (PCT)"

Two additional dimensions \n(long -term and indulgence) were added (Hofstede et al., 2010) after research involving IBM \nemployees.  \n \nWhile Hofstede's dimensions offer valuable insights into HRD, explaining the influence of national \nculture on behavior and organizational tendencies (Louahabi et al., 2020), they fall short of \ncapturing culture’s complexities (Ailon, 2008). Further researc h is needed to unravel the intricate \ninterplay among culture, human behaviors, and HRD practices (Najera, 2008). Scholars advocate \nrefining Hofstede's framework by considering regional and subcultural variations within countries \nto enhance HRD strategies ( Balambo, 2014; Duncanson et al., 2016; Hennekam & Tahssain -Gay, \n2015; Louahabi et al., 2020).  \n \nThis study explores the Moroccan context, with Balambo (2014) using Hofstede's model to uncover \nunique cultural traits, emphasizing the religious factor. Louahabi et al.'s (2020) exploration of \nHofstede's 6 -D model at the subcultural level reveals signific ant deviations from national culture, \nwith religious factors playing a key role in shaping workplace dynamics.  \nEmpirical studies on Moroccan organizational culture through Hofstede's model are notably scarce \n(Aljayi et al., 2016). The diverse regional subcultures and the influential role of religious \ncharacteristics in Morocco pose challenges in applying Hofstede’s  model (Balambo, 2014; Louahabi \net al., 2020).  \n \nThis paper qualitatively explores Moroccan culture’s impact on employee behaviors, focusing on the \nadministrative staff at a public university. The study examines the interplay of national culture, \nparticularly the religiosity factor, on organizational beh avior. Rooted in Hofstede's six cultural \ndimensions (Hofstede et al., 2010) and enriched by the religious dimension emphasized by Balambo \n(2014), this research transcends existing limitations, providing a nuanced understanding of \nadditional cultural dimens ions.  \n \nThe research design prioritizes selecting diverse administrative staff for a comprehensive \nperspective (Johnson et al., 2021; Brown & Martinez, 2022; Lichtman, 2023). This group's \nrepresentation spans various job levels, genders, ages, and regions, offerin g insights into cultural \ndynamics within the public university. As key participants in organizational operations, the \nadministrative staff plays a crucial role in understanding the intersections of culture, religiosity, and \nworkplace behavior.  \n \nThe chosen methodology employs semi -structured interviews and field observations as primary \ndata collection methods, using thematic analysis for in -depth exploration. This approach facilitates \nunderstanding participants' experiences, perceptions, and behaviors within the organizational \nsetting. Rigorous confidentiality measures, including consent forms, pseudonyms, secure data \nstorage, and researcher -only a ccess (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016), maintain participant privacy. \nFurthermore, the independent recruitment process, individual contact for participation consent,"

MSMEs, act as conduits \nfor the introduction of new technologies, operational knowledge,  and innovative products.  When \ncompared to larger corporations, MSMEs possess the capacity to generate a more diverse range of \nemployment opportunities across varying specialties (Khan & Khalique, 2014; Andah & Onana, \n2020).  The recognition of their pote ntial impact on socioeconomic progress, especially within \nnumerous developing nations, including Nigeria, has resulted in a prioritization of the support for \nMSMEs. Within such countries, MSMEs have contributed over 55% to the GDP.  They further account \nfor 65% of total employment (Akbar et al., 2018; Al -Dairi et al., 2012; Nakibullah, 2018). Further, to \nexplore the nature of the role of successful MSMEs in the economic ecosystem, it seems paramount \nto identify any key factors that contribute to the sustain able and continued success of MSME \nenterprises.    \n \nThis paper originates from doctoral investigation into the growth dynamics of MSMEs in Nigeria.   \nAdopting a phenomenological interpretation, it focused upon the approaches of  MSME owners.   \nAdopting a Critical Human Resource Development (CHRD) (Lee, 2001 ; Gold & Bratton, 2014) lens, \nthe study initially analysed exploratory semi -structured interviews undertaken.  From this initial \ninvestigatory review, Religiosity adopted by the proprietor was identified as a possible success \nfactor for Nigerian MSME (Ejio gu & Keeble -Ramsay, 2023).   Acknowledging the cultural and religious \nlandscape in developing economies, where religion plays a prominent role in daily life (Adeleke & \nOlabisi, 2018; Ogujiuba & Uzor, 2020), it emerged that further consideration of any inte rsection of \nreligion and business was warranted.  Specifically, given the context of MSMEs, such exploration \nmight offer valuable insights.  In particular, by unpacking how religious beliefs and practices \ninfluence and play out may have potential for consi dering resilience and growth potential of the \nenterprise facing environmental and economic challenges.  Through conducting an initial scoping \nliterature review (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005) to investigate any intersection of religiosity and business, \nthis pape r reports then on the discourse surrounding any relationship between religiosity and \nbusiness practices.  \n \nScholars (Smith & Rayment, 2007; Koenig et al., 2001; Kimura et al., 2012; Lucchetti et al., 2012; \nArmitage & Keeble -Ramsay, 2015; Dias & Pais -Ribeiro, 2017; Panzini et al., 2017) across diverse \ndisciplines, have considered how religious and spiritual cont exts influence individuals in their lives \nand work.  These works recognised that organisations have increasingly adopted management \nmodels which address employees' emotional, affective, and spiritual well -being alongside their \nmaterial needs (Chowdhury, 20 18; Silva, 2008).  In conducting this scoping review, searches were \nconducted by engaging with academic databases (such as PubMed, PsycINFO, JSTOR) using \nkeywords like \"religiosity in business,\" \"faith and entrepreneurship,\" \"spirituality in the workplace, \" \nto provide any landscape of current thinking.   Given the study was conducted in 2023, the Inclusion \nCriteria for this investigation encompassed studies in peer -reviewed journals, and conference \nproceedings published between 2000 and 2022, prioritizing E nglish -language publications.  A two -\nstep selection process involving initial articles provided the final selection of sources. The finalised \nselection considered the contributions in terms of critical insights into any religiosity -business \nrelationship.   Aiming to identify common themes, patterns, and gaps, Thematic organization and \nanalysis further facilitated the final synthesis of the research topic."

      "text": "218 \nID:191 - Female Entrepreneurship within the Chinese and Asian Context  \nDr TJ McCabe  & Professor Thomas Garavan  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nPaper’s Importance  \nThis study was prompted by calls to strategically promote female entrepreneurship in a drive to \nachieve sustainable economic growth within Asia (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2018; \nMastercard 2018). McKinsey Global Institute’s (2018) report on women’s eq uality in Asia, found that \nthe region's economic development could be greatly enhanced by advancing women’s participation \nin economic activities. While most studies on women in leadership have been conducted in a \nWestern context (Cho et al., 2020), the Asi a context differs in several different respects. Cooke and \nXiao (2021) pointed out that research has not kept pace with the recent growth in the number of \nwomen entrepreneurs in China. Furthermore, the economic impact of the COVID -19 pandemic has \nalso led to large -scale unemployment and underemployment. This has resulted in many people, \nincluding women, setting up their own businesses and becoming self -employed. These \ndevelopments all have human resource development (HRD) implications (Li, et al., 2020).  \n \nTheoretical base  \nThe barriers female entrepreneurs face in starting or running their businesses have attracted \nincreasing attention from researchers and policymakers (Cooke and Xiao, 2021). Tong and Chen \n(2004) regard female entrepreneurs as those who take part in the proc ess of building up a \ncompany, sharing part of its property rights, and taking charge of company operations. Despite \nshared characteristics across national settings, entrepreneurship is context -specific (Gelderen and \nMasurel 2012).  \n \nResearch also highlights important gender differences in both career anchors and work values \n(Haslett and Leidel 2015; Hardin et al. 2006; Dyke and Murphy 2006; Kirchmeyer 2006). Studies \nshow that men and women differ in their entrepreneurial career aspira tions and trajectories as \nentrepreneurs (Cooke and Xiao 2021). The role of gender has unique complexities in the Chinese \nand Asian contexts, where traditional culture and religious beliefs dictate the inferior status of \nwomen in their daily lives and this spills over into the realm of entrepreneurship (Cooke and Xiao \n2021). The internalization of Chinese culture and beliefs has resulted in many women prioritizing \nfamily over career development. The notion that men are more capable as the primary income \ngene rator and women as the caregiver of the family (Cooke and Xiao 2021), has in some cases \nundermined women’s self -confidence (Cooke and Xiao 2021). Recent studies suggest gender \nstereotypes embedded in traditional Chinese culture hamper women’s entrepreneurs hip. Women \nin China take up self -employment for multiple reasons including work -life balance, personal career \ndevelopment and self -actualization (Li et al. 2020; Ng et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2019). Some women \nperceive disadvantages in self -employment and val ue job security more so than males (Díaz and \nJiménez 2010; Haslett and Leidel 2015). Chinese culture emphasizes a preference for male as \nopposed to female entrepreneurship with many women viewing it as less desirable (Diaz -Garcia et \nal. 2015). This affects  the types of challenges female entrepreneurs face and their motivation \ntowards business creation and development (Henry et al. 2016; Jennings and Brush 2013).  \n \nResearch purpose  \nOur study is in response to calls by Cho et al. (2021) for further research and new insights into \nfemale entrepreneurship that include and go beyond the Chinese and Asian context (Cooke and \nXiao, 2021). In exploring the socio -cultural barriers to female en trepreneurship, we intend to use an \ninterpretive research design for this study. We will also use a quantitative, survey method in"

As a \nresult, coastal issues around the world have seen massive inves tment, including in the U.S. \nBipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes funding for coastal resilience (National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, 2022). This has also led research universities such as Louisiana State \nUniversity to prioritize inte rdisciplinary research around coastal issues as a way to maximize \nsocietal impact (Louisiana State University, n.d.). Similar to coastal areas in Louisiana, Thailand \nexperiences some of the world’s most complex and critical environmental problems, such as coastal \nland loss, nutrient and chemical pollution, and vulnerability to severe weather (Bridhikitti, \nPrabambroong, Liu, and Yu, 2021), which make it an illustrative and comparable example of coastal \nchallenges (Fanh, 2003). Coastal erosion has a long hist ory in Thailand (Vongyisessomjai et al., 1996), \nwhich affects communities and wildlife habitats such as fisheries that are crucial for Thailand's \neconomy and its citizens’ well -being (Nicholls et al. 2007). Even the popular tourism destination of \nBangkok i s sinking due to shoreline erosion, groundwater extraction, and climate change (Olson \nand Kreznor, 2021), the costs of which will continue to be astronomical (Hinkel et al., 2014).  \nWhile important work is being done by environmental engineers and scientists (Sangsupavanich, \nChonwattana, and Naimsampao, 2009) as well as ecotourism operators (Tseng et al., 2019), thinking \nlong -term about addressing these problems requires leveraging co mmunity -based efforts in \nleadership development and training around coastal protection. Building community resilience \nthrough training and leadership development is key to long -term sustainability and coastal \npreservation. Research shows that training and human resource development are key mechanisms \nfor communicating the risks of climate change and ‘enabling pro -environmental behavior’ (Sadler -\nSmith, 2015). While there have been vital contributions related to environmental education and \ntraining in Thailan d generally (Junkaew, Wongchantra, and Wutthisak, 2021), more work needs to be \ndone related specifically to the unique challenges of community resilience amidst coastal erosion \nand sea -level rise. This project builds on my recent grant work in 2022 (NSF Aw ard No. 2226565, \n$99,869.00; PI - Christopher D’Elia) where we developed and evaluated teacher training on coastal \npreservation for a school STEM Program.  \n \nTheoretical Base  \nThe theoretical base framing this inquiry includes (a) Human resource development, in particular \nleadership development and training, (b) community resilience, and (c) coastal preservation and \nenvironmental change.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nThe purpose of this exploratory multi -case study is to understand the role of leadership \ndevelopment and training in coastal preservation and community resilience in Thailand.  \n \nResearch Questions  \nThe research questions guiding this inquiry include: (a) In what ways do environmental \norganizations in Thailand utilize human resource development activities such as leadership \ndevelopment and training to build coastal community resilience? (b) What do tr aining materials and \norganizational documents demonstrate are the mechanisms utilized in facilitating these activities?"

Workers need to continuously learn new skills and  knowledge to either maintain \ntheir current jobs or transition to better employment opportunities (Sarojni & Anh, 2023) and \nlifelong learning is considered an effective tool for improving their professional lives (Päivi, 2016).  \nAlthough lifelong learning experiences are also known to affect the perception of quality of life in \nvarious aspects (Dion & Ben, 2011; Hammond, 2004), the experience of learning participation differs \nbased on the employment status or profession of working  adults, and these variations in \nexperience may also influence their perception of quality of life (Jonathan & Maura, 2002; Lee, \n2006).  \n \nThe purpose of this proposal is to investigate whether employment status and stability, and types of \noccupations influence participation in lifelong learning and whether those characteristics affect \ntheir perception of quality of life after participating i n lifelong learning.  \n \nLiterature Review and Research Hypotheses  \n \nFrom an organizational perspective, the development of workers’ capabilities is an essential task \nthrough education and training. At the individual level, participation in vocational programs is \ncommon for developing current or future job -related skills, a nd lifelong learning participation is \nreported to lead to an improvement in the quality of life as well (Hwang & Kil, 2017).  \nHuman capital theory is a widely recognized economic theory that explains the relationship \nbetween education and quality of life. Human capital represented as skills, functions, and \nknowledge acquired over an extended period through education and training can enhance an \nindividual’s productivity, and ultimately leading to an improved quality of life even though it does \nnot account for all factors influencing an individual’s well -being. Adult learners often participate in \nlifelong learning to perform their j obs more effectively. Knowles’ adult learning theory (1980), \nAndragogy, highlights that adults’ learning motivations frequently stem from a desire to improve \ntheir careers or quality of life (Sung et al., 2015).  \n \nThe stability of employment type affects the learning environment of working individuals. Previous \nstudies suggest that individuals with higher employment stability tend to participate more in \nlifelong learning compared to those with lower stability (Son, 2004; Yoon & Park, 2017). In contrast, \nnon-regular workers with lower employment stability may perceive exclusion or discrimination from \norganizational learning experiences (Pyun et al., 2007).  \nLifelong learning has also been discussed in relation to quality of life. For instance, higher \nparticipation in lifelong learning is associated with higher happiness levels (Hwang, 2015; Koh & Lee, \n2014; Kwon, 2013) and lifelong learning participation cont ributes to recovery from mental health \ndisorders and enhances the ability to cope with potential stress -inducing situations (Hammond, \n2004). Overall, lifelong learning participation and satisfaction may positively influence the quality of \nlife and happines s."

Even after the national liberation movements from the 1950s to the 1970s, \nwhen many countries broke free from colonialism, they have been  plagued by authoritarian neo -\npatrimonial rulers who continue to erode democratic principles (Diamond & Plattner, 1999; \nFonchingong, 2004; Nur, 2015). Cameroon achieved independence on January 1, 1960. However, the \ncountry continues to be an illiberal demo cracy with flawed elections, corruption, reduced civil \nliberties, marginalization of ethnic groups, and inequalities in the distribution of resources \n(Nsangou, 2022). President Biya has personified the regime since 1982, subverting the democratic \nprocess b y changing presidential term limits and by changing the constitution through legally \ndubious amendments (Fonkwa, 2020).  \n \nPolitical activism in Sub -Saharan Africa has seen many phases. Pro -democracy protests in the 1990s \nevolved into modern street mobilization or street democracy, referred to as “rucratie” (Sadovskaya \net al., 2021, p. xx). This new wave of protest, also called the third wave (Nwosu, 2012; Nur, 2016), is \nknown for using non -traditional protest methods highlighting the persistence of activists in \nprotesting in the streets and city squares. More recently, the use of nontraditional tactics including \nstrikes, nonviolent resistance, etc., combined with the intensive use of social media, has given birth \nto hybrid social movements with new s trategies to curtail the effects of repressive regimes (De Waal \n& Ibreck, 2013).  \n \nActivism for social and political change has the power to create movements and momentum to \neffect substantial policy changes and even overturn authoritarian regimes. Given the social \nimportance of political activism, it is critical to understand what motiv ates these leaders to engage \nin it, how they become engaged in it, and their experiences as political activists, fighting for social \njustice and democratization. Past research has predominantly focused on the structural aspects of \nthe movements (Mateos & E rro, 2021) rather than on leaders, or on individual and collective \nfrustrations as factors that motivate political actions (Bettache et. al., 2019). However, the lived \nexperiences of leaders engaged in political activism has been largely neglected in the l iterature. \nThere is little known about activists in sub -Saharan Africa, and almost none about such leaders from \nCameroon. Further, there are no studies, to my knowledge, that have looked at how experiences of \npolitical activism can be different when they a re embedded within an authoritarian regime, and \nwhen they are engaged as part of the diaspora from a different country (Moss, 2019, 2020). \nTherefore, there is a significant lacuna in the academic literature, which this study seeks to address.  \nThe purpose of this study was to understand, through narrative inquiry (Clandinin, 2013; 2016; \nClandinin & Caine, 2011; Riessman, 2008), the lived experiences of nonviolent political activists in \nCameroon and those from the diaspora who are engaged in poli tical activism for democratization in \nsub-Saharan Africa. In order to conduct this type of methodological research based upon narrative \ninquiry (Clandinin, 2013; 2016; Clandinin & Caine, 2011; Riessman, 2008), 15 nonviolent political \nactivists who took par t in change movements in Cameroon were recruited as research participants \nusing critical case sampling (Patton, 2002; Staller, 2021). I conducted in -depth semi -structured \nnarrative interviews (Riessman, 2008) via Zoom. These interviews were recorded on Zoo m and \ntranscribed into text files. After reading each transcript, member checks were conducted (Creswell, \n2018; Miles, Huberman & Saldana, 2014; Saldana & Omasta, 2022). These transcriptions served as \nthe primary source of information, with the interview d ata being treated as histories, narratives, and \nevents through which the interviewees described their world (Gubrium & Holstein, 1995).

At each step of the process, I \nreturned to the video recordings, and also listened to the audio recordings  to enhance the quality of \nthe transcripts.  \n \nThe study challenges assumptions and stereotypes about political activism. By presenting diverse \nand nuanced narratives, it underscores the complexity of activism, dismantling one -dimensional \nportrayals and fostering a more accurate and empathetic understa nding of the lived experiences of \nactivists. The findings of this study will inform political activists facing similar challenges. This study \nalso provides the opportunity for the voices of political activists to be heard outside the walls of the \nrepressiv e regime that they are often silenced within. Insights from the study offer policymakers a \ndeeper understanding of the diverse challenges faced by political activists in Cameroon. This \nunderstanding is crucial for developing targeted policies that support and protect activists, \nacknowledging their engagement's dynamic nature and the evolving challenges across the life \ncourse. Furthermore, this study is a valuable resource for social activists, advocacy groups, and \norganizations promoting political and socia l change. Highlighting activists' experiences, challenges, \nand leadership qualities provides a basis for informed advocacy strategies and the development of \nsupportive networks. Further, this study sheds light on human resource processes and practices in \nsocial movements, which is often overlooked in HRD research since social movements do not fit the \ndescription of a typical organization (Callahan, 2013), contributing to the HRD literature on social \nmovements.  \n  \nReferences  \n \nBerg, B.

It is crucial to consider the socio -cultural dynamics at work as well as \ntechnological and economic aspects to properly handle these difficulties. How Nigerians interact \nwith their environment and manage  it is greatly influenced by cultural ideas, traditions, and social \nconventions (Okotie et al., 2019; Onyishi et al., 2021). Therefore, creating sustainable practices and \npolicies requires an understanding of and integration of the socio -cultural elements that influence \nsustainable environmental development in Nigeria.  \n \nThus, drawn from an ongoing doctoral research into exploring the notion of sustainability \nconsciousness in Nigeria through the lived experiences of actors and stakeholders in environmental \nsustainability. , Our paper proposes that as Nigeria faces the twin goals of meeting socio -economic \ndevelopment and ensuring environmental sustainability simultaneously to compete in par with \nother African and global economies. The developmen t of the nation’s environmental policy is very \nmuch dependent on its economic and socio -cultural efficacy into implementing and monitoring \nrelevant policy infrastructure and an enhancement of the environmental knowledge of its citizens \n(Goldsmith, 1997).  \n \nAnother key rationale for this study is the conventional application of western solutions to \nenvironmental issues to solve African challenges. However as previously highlighted the socio -\neconomic issues facing most African countries including Nigeria are d ifferent in comparison to \nsocio -economic issues facing the West. Hence this study proposes how sustainability consciousness \ncan be contextually inculcated for practice among environmental sustainability stakeholders within \nNigeria.   \n \nOur paper thus in -depth explores the central research question of, “How can the needs of the \nenvironment be made a priority for Nigeria with the persistent socio -economic issues?”. As various \nstudies have all revealed that the lived experiences of victims of environmental degradation have \nbeen under reported, the loopholes in environmental policies and regulations have been \nimproperly analyzed, and a contemporary approach to sustainability consciousness needs to \nemerge (Agboola & Agboola, 1997 and Areola, 2 001).   \n \nUsing the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach is employed by the research \n(Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009) in which actors and stakeholders' experiences are analyzed. Data \nwas collected through in -depth semi -structured interviews from bo th pre -colonial and post -colonial \nlived experiences of victims affected by environmental degradation in Nigeria, policy makers and \ndecision makers in oil producing and processing companies. This was interpreted and analyzed \ncovering aspects of environmenta l sustainability; sustainability consciousness and awareness of \npolicy frameworks and infrastructures for managing environmental sustainability in the country.  \nThis paper provides insights for future investigations and policy actions drawing on Environmental, \nSocial and Governance (ESG) framework; Theory of Change and; Theory of Planned Behaviour as \nthe theoretical lenses."

      "text": "236 \nID:22  - The role of HR in preventing and managing sexual Harassment in the \nEgyptian workplace  \n \nHanan Shehata  & Stevens Madeleine  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThe role of HR in preventing and managing sexual harassment in the Egyptian workplace  \nSexual harassment of females in the workplace is a significant problem impacting individuals as well \nas the organisation.  Studies in the Western nations have become increasingly prevalent, whilst \nacademic research in African countries such as Egypt is relatively limited.  We belief, the lim ited \nstudies could be linked to the culture of fear of speaking out in Egypt. In fact, by conducting this \nresearch alone, the lead author experienced harassment and intimidation from nationals who \nobjected to this study.  \n \nOne of the most significant obstacles that victims of sexual harassment face are that certain \norganisations are hesitant to accept incidences of inappropriate conduct, and they may distort \nevidence and witnesses or refuse to allow the victim of harassment to access investigation findings. \nAlthough they may urge victims to speak out, they do not provide them with any safety to continue \nadvancing their careers. Victims may also feel victimised and vulnerable in a hostile workplace \n(Ghoneimy, 2022) for example , there was a well -known sexual harassment case in Cairo in 2018 \nwhen The Dokki Prosecution decided to administratively close the investigation into journalist \nDandrawy El Hawary's alleged sexual harassment of his colleague, journalist Mai El Shamy, in the  \neditorial office of the newspaper Al Youm Al Sabaa, where he serves as Executive Editor -in-Chief \n(Cairo24, 2018). This case influenced a further study to establish the incidences of sexual \nharassment in Egypt.  \n \nThis study analyses the impact of sexual harassment on Egyptian women by establishing the \nfollowing objectives:  \n• The incandesces of sexual harassment in the workplace  \n• The impact of sexual harassment on well -being, job satisfaction and productivity  \n• The role of workplace social support as a mediator in mitigating the adverse effects of \nworkplace sexual harassment  \n \nData was collected through a survey of 366 Egyptian women aged 18 and over, using quantitative \nanalysis through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).  \nFrom the 366 respondents, 72.4% of the females had experienced sexual harassment in the \nworkplace.  The research indicates that 81% of respondents experienced adverse effects on their \nwell-being with symptoms of anxiety and depression and reduced job satis faction and decreased \nproductivity, as a result of workplace sexual harassment.  \n \nWhen it came to support from colleagues who witnessed sexual harassment a staggering 79% \nstated that they would most likely not intervene.  \n \nTheoretical underpinning:  \nWe argue that an individual’s social identity can easily be altered through a perceived breach of \norganisational trust when sexual harassment occurs and / or is left ignored in an organisation, \nmoving employees from ‘in group’ inclusiveness to ‘out group’ by drawing on Tayfel’s (1979) social \nidentity framework.  The occurrence or sexual harassment thus leaves victims of sexual harassment \nwith a dissatisfied social identity."

Prevention is the most effective method for \nlimiting the high incidences of sexual harassment.  \nThis indicated the need for organisations to establish clear and well -communicated policies \noutlining zero tolerance for harassment, defining reporting mechanisms, and ensuring appropriate \ndisciplinary actions (Cochrane, Zeid, and Sharif, 2019; Ouederni, 2 020; Abdel -Fattah et al., 2020).  \nHigh on the agenda for HR is to raise awareness of what sexual harassment is and to advocate what \nis acceptable behaviour.

This study investigates the \nvital role of intercultural communicative competence in the context of global, virtual coworking, and \ntraditional face -to-face teamwork. This research uses a quantitative methodology to analyze \nteamwork patterns within culturally diverse teams. 133 questio nnaires were collected and analyzed \nusing the IBM SPSS Statistics 27 program. The findings indicate that intercultural communicative \ncompetence is crucial for success in virtual teams. Proficient intercultural skills facilitate identifying \nand considering cultural differences during project management, enhancing overall team \nperformance. However, the dynamics of intercultural competence in face -to-face teamwork appear \nmore complex. The willingness to explore and understand the backgrounds of fellow teammate s \nemerges as a higher priority than temporary effectiveness achieved through intercultural \ncompetence. In today's globalized world, intercultural communicative competence is a vital \nworkplace requirement across industries, professions, and geographic locat ions. The ability to \ncomprehend and adapt to diverse cultural perspectives is increasingly essential for effective \ncollaboration in virtual settings or face -to-face interactions.

The UK is the second most popular choice in the world for IS to study (Lillyman & Bennett, \n2014). Attention has been paid to the IS and learning experience  in UK universities (see Lillyman & \nBennett, 2014). These experiences highlight challenges such as language barriers, writing in a \nsecond language (Evans & Stevenson, 2011) and cultural differences (Huang, 2012). In addition, \nthere has been some attention on the issues for IS when faced with new approaches to \nteaching/learning (e.g., Carroll, 2014).  \n \nOne new approach to teaching/learning is block and blend. Block teaching is a mode of learning \nwhere courses are structured so that students engage with a single module at a time. Whilst not a \nnew development in HE, with intensive course existing in many g uises across FE and HE sectors, a \nblock mode of teaching/learning has been trialled more recently in UK institutions (e.g., Liverpool \nJohn Moores, The University of Bedfordshire, Manchester Metropolitan University). These trials \nwere met with some practica l concerns around timetabling, staff fatigue and the limited time for \nreflection upon teaching delivery and materials (Buck & Tyrrell, 2022). However, on a more positive \nnote, block teaching can be seen as a useful transition tool and helpful in promoting continuous \nlearning experiences.  \n \nWhereas blended learning can be identified as an umbrella term describing ‘the use of technology \nin education settings’ within delivery of courses and/or curriculum (Buck & Tyrell, 2022 p.1080). Its \nrapid growth, triggered by the COVID -19 pandemic, saw a m ass shift to online learning. To begin \nwith the Wonkhe and Pearson (2020) student expectation survey highlighted how students \nexperienced wellbeing and practical difficulties because of the transition to online learning, and the \nsurvey envisages this to co ntinue. However, 80% of students also agree that they would like to \ncontinue some form of blended teaching/learning experiences due to the flexibility of virtual \nlearning. Since the COVID -19 pandemic blended learning is more of a permanent and strategic \nchange across HE, because it creates greater accessibility, new ways of widening participation and \ncan facilitate improved student engagement with learning (Buck & Tyrrell, 2022). However, there is \nlittle understanding on how block and blended approaches to teaching/learning impact on the IS \nexperience.  \n \nThis paper aims to explore the impact block and blend teaching has on the IS experience. The \nUniversity of XXXX adopts a block and blend approach to teaching, where full -time undergraduate \ncourses are typically delivered through 12 -week modules of learning  and assessment. Using The \nUniversity of XXXX as a case study from a pilot study, 10 -15 semi -structured interviews have been \nconducted with IS who study at the University. The paper will show the impact block and blend has \non the learning and teaching expe rience for international studies compared to traditional forms of \nteaching. It will conclude by considering what can be done to support the IS in block and blend \nsettings.  \n \nReferences  \n \nBuck, E. & Tyrell, K.

Workshop importance  \nThe ability to carry out robust research is a central component of HRD. Evidence based practice \nrelies on practitioners who are able to identify good quality research and know how to apply \nfindings impactfully in their practice.  Research methods training and the requirement for a \ndissertation or research project are core to Masters and Doctorate level qualifications.  \nPedagogy, in relation research methods, involves an interaction between learning and teaching \npractices, and educators’ underlying beliefs and values regarding how both learning and research \ncan and should occur and does, occur. Most higher education pedag ogy in HRD is grounded in \ntheories of experiential learning (Yeo & Marquart, 2015), reflective learning (Tomozumi Nakamura \nand Yorks, 2011) and inquiry -based or action learning (Yeo & Gold, 2011). However, many students \nstruggle with this feature of their professional development and many educators find that a \nresearch methods pedagogy, appropriate to meet the wide range of learning needs and \nbackgrounds of an increasingly diverse student population, is challenging to develop.  \n \n2. Workshop aim and purpose  \nThe aim of this workshop is to generate practice sharing stories from everyone who attends \nfocused on successes, challenges, and opportunities for learning and teaching research methods in \ncontemporary contexts.  \nThis knowledge sharing session will be followed by the opportunity to contribute to a research \nmethods teaching resource listing that will be circulated to participants after the workshop  \n \n3. Workshop process  \n1. The workshop will begin with short facilitator introductions and brief reflections around the \nquestion: How did I learn to be a competent researcher and what struggles did I encounter in this \nprocess?  \n2. A structured but impromptu networking process will take place to enable participants to meet \nothers who they do not know and share their reflections on the challenges and opportunities facing \nRM learners and (as appropriate) RM teachers these days?  \n3. Following feedback of main themes / issues from this process, participants will engage in \nbreakout groups to discuss RM teaching opportunities and issues in more depth by sharing stories \nof positive critical incidents; highlighting new RM teaching and lear ning opportunities they have \nencountered recently, and any other ‘lightbulb moments’ relevant to teaching and learning research \nmethods   \n4. The workshop will conclude with a plenary -style session to share key points from the group and \nprovide pointers towards useful resources for teaching Research Methods  \n \n4.

This working  paper focuses on developing \nappropriate frameworks to enable individual and organisational performance in the context of \nspecific labour law by sharing the preliminary findings of an ongoing study in German Corporates.  \n  \nTheoretical base  \nHybrid work has become an integral part of today's professional life (Flüter -Hoffmann and Stettes, \n2022). The challenge for employees and employers is to find a good balance between working in the \noffice and from home - with the aim of ensuring and strengt hening the performance of the \nindividual as well as the overall organisational performance (Lee and Gascó -Hernandez, 2023).  \nPositive aspects include the flexibility gained, the compatibility of work and family life and the \nincreased personal responsibilit y of employees (Boch, 2021; Schaffelhofer, 2022). Critics emphasise \nthe blurred boundaries between work and leisure time, isolation while working from home and loss \nof control by managers (Burkhart, 2023; Von Bergen et al., 2019).   \n  \nBoth advocates and critics emphasise the need for further research to create an effective working \nmodel focused on the organisational perspective. Two key models of organisational performance \ndeveloped prior to the pandemic are the JD -R model (Bakker and D emerouti, 2017)and the \napproach of the seven (formerly 16) HRM best practises (Pfeffer, 1998). Both models work on the \nassumption that the interaction of HR practices and factors can have an influence on organisational \nperformance. This study explores the appropriateness of such models in developing frameworks \nfor hybrid working.  \n  \nResearch purpose   \nIn order to investigate the ambiguities in previous research and develop a new framework for \nhybrid working the study will seek through a series of qualitative interviews and thematic analysis \n(Braun and Clarke, 2021) answers to the following questions thr ough the perspective of HR \nmanagers, general managers and employees:   \n  \n1. What do HR professionals perceive as the essential features of effective working from home in \nhybrid patterns on an overall organisational level?  \n2. What do general managers perceive as the essential features of effective working from home in \nhybrid patterns on an overall organisational level?  \n3. What do white -collar employees perceive as the essential features of effective working from \nhome in hybrid patterns on an overall organisational level?  \n4. Where do HR professionals, general management, and white -collar employees agree and \ndisagree regarding effective working from home in hybrid patterns on an overall organisational \nlevel?"

Belonging, mattering and becoming form the foundation upon which self -actualisation \nand self -efficacy are built’. (Gaunt & O’Hara, 2023). In terms of be longing, we know that students \nwho make friends quickly are more likely to stay, to engage and to progress better and that a sense \nof belonging is strongly associated with academic success (Thomas et al, 2021), so the activity \nshowcased here is a great way  to demonstrate how these foundations are built.  \n \nPapers importance:  \nThis presentation/paper is important as it will show how Higher Education Institutions can build a \nsense of belonging earlier for their students and as a result, develop their relationship building skills \nand their chances of staying.  \n  \nResearch/Activity Purpose:  \nThe University of Wolverhampton Business School is well known for it’s successful Student -Director \npartnership whereby mentors from the Institute of Directors (IoD) nurture final year undergraduate \nstudents towards becoming ready for the job of their dream s. Looking for ways of extending this \nvery effective 14 year partnership further for the benefit of developing a sense of belonging and \nmattering for our first year students, we developed a welcome week activity involving IoD mentors \ntoo, called the £10 ch allenge.  \n \nThis £10 challenge involves all of our new Business School students (approximately 250 students) in \ntheir first week with us being put into groups to set up a small business by creating a product or \nservice to sell that week, with the aim of raising as muc h money for a local charity as possible within \ntheir first 3 days. Each group is given £10 to start with (provided by a local bank) and the hope is \nthat students will at least be able to double this money; so we can give the £10 back to the bank and \nalso g ive the additional monies to the local charity.  \nThe student groups are each given an IoD Director as a mentor to support their planning and their \nactivities over the week. This year, over 25 groups of students were involved and they made over \n£1500.00 in profit, in just 3 days.  \n \nFindings/Implications for practice:  \nThis high -impact welcome week activity provides a clear focus and holistic growth for the students \non their first few days with us. It is an opportunity to work with other students doing meaningful \nwork that is very relevant to their business degree. It is  a chance to find out more about the \nuniversity location and surrounding environment. It is an opportunity to raise money for a much \nneeded local cause. In addition, it is a great opportunity for students to make friends, settle in more \nquickly and gain an  early sense of belonging.  \n \nThis session/paper will share insights into how the £10 challenge was managed, the results that \nwere gained and the learning gained by both students and staff alike. Having run the activity for the \nlast 2 years, we have reflected on some of the challenges and have made some changes that we \nwould like to share with others who may be thinking of running such an activity in the future."

From ‘Circle of Life’, The Lion King (Elton John & Tim Rice, 1994)  \nIn many ways, the following study on the conception, design, development and delivery of the \nUniversity of Minnesota’s forthcoming fully online and asynchronous Master’s in Learning and \nTalent Development (MLTD) echoes the apparent themes of the above quot ed song - birth, \nopportunities, development, death, uncertainty and finally rebirth. And through the lifespan, it is \nrelationships that define the journey and so perhaps the story is best told within those guiding \nparameters. In this paper, we present the development of this new graduate degree program in \nHuman Resource Development (HRD) with connection of an applied pedagogical and project \nmanagement effort within frames of existing research and theory on training and instructional \ndesign.  \n \nThere exists a number of studies that describe the characteristics and current status of HRD \nacademic programs, in the UK (Stewart, J., Mills, S., & Sambrook, S. (2015), the US (Kunchinke, 2002; \nWatkins & Marsick, 2016; Zachmeier, Cho, & Kim, 2014) and glo bally (Kuchinke & Oh, 2006). Yet, \nthere are few studies in HRD that describe the process of development of new programs, especially \nat the graduate level (masters and doctoral). While what we wish to present is firmly rooted in our \nown personal experiences  of being involved in the project from inception, it will also explore the \nacademic program’s development from a local, national, and international perspective. The \nselection of local, national, and internationally analytical lens allows examination of cor e aspects of \nthe current state of the global higher education market and more specifically to existing and future \nHRD academic program development and operation in theory and practice.  \nThe overall theoretical frame for this study of the development of a new graduate online HRD \ndegree program draws from established models for curriculum design in training and instructional \ndesign. However, and in support of Willeke (2011) who observed “th e industry standard for \ncurriculum developers that is increasingly found wanting due to its lack of practical application to \nreal world situations is a methodology called ADDIE, and represents Analyze, Design, Develop, \nImplement, and Evaluate.” (p. 2). In response, we sought to explore alternative approaches that \nwould lead to a richer and more complete understanding of the process of development of a new \ngraduate HRD program. The purpose of the study was therefore to examine the design, \ndevelopment, and de livery of a fully online graduate HRD program to provide insight for faculty and \nhigher education administrators interested in this complex process.  \n \nBirth & Opportunities (Analysis)  \nWith reference to the Analysis element of ADDIE, this section will explore the conception of the new \nprogram.

Research on the research -to-practice gap (e.g., Beer, 2020; Bleijenbergh et al., 2021; \nLawler & Benson, 2022) highlights the stark divide between research findings and their \nimplementation in real -world contexts. This disconnect is evident in the HRD field, despite its \nobjective of enhancing organizational performance through l earning and development at individual, \nteam, and organizational levels (Cho & Zachmeier, 2015). The purpose of this study, therefore, was \nto see the current state of the research -practice gap and how to bridge the chasm between HRD \nresearch and its practic al applications.  \n \nIn this qualitative study, we examined the lived experiences of HR practitioners to gain insights into \nidentifying solutions to workplace challenges and their perceptions of the role of research in \nshaping those solutions. Three key research questions guid ed our inquiry: what workplace \nchallenges do HR practitioners face? What resources do HR practitioners employ to resolve \nworkplace issues? And why, or why not, do HR practitioners use research to find solutions for \nworkplace challenges? To address these qu estions, we employed a basic qualitative research design \n(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016) used to provide an in -depth qualitative exploration of the research -\npractice gap through HR practitioners’ experiences in their own words. We used a purposeful \nsampling to s elect interview participants employed as HR practitioners with at least five years of \nwork experience in the United States so that they can reflect on their perspective of research. We \nconducted semi -structured interviews with 15 HR practitioners through t he East Texas Human \nResource Association (https://goethra.org/), using interview questions developed to probe HR \npractitioners’ perspectives on the role of research in resolving workplace issues. To ensure the \nstudy’s validity, we asked participants to rev iew their transcript in a member -check process. To \nanalyze the interview data, we used a thematic analysis (Lester et al., 2020) with the help of NVivo \n14, qualitative data analysis software, and identified three major themes:  \n \n• HR practitioners grapple with urgent workplace challenges: time constraints, recruitment, \nand retention  \n• HR practitioners predominantly rely on resources provided by practitioner organizations \n(e.g., SHRM and the ATD), often bypassing research organizations (e.g., AHRD and UFHRD)  \n• HR practitioners perceive research as lacking practicality, ease, and urgency in addressing \nworkplace issues  \n \nThis qualitative study is significant as it aptly captures HRD practitioners’ insights into the research -\npractice gap. Through an in -depth exploration of HR practitioners’ experiences and perspectives, \nthis qualitative study yielded information about the w orkplace challenges HR practitioners face and \ntheir preferred resources for addressing workplace issues. Below are the implications for research \nand practice, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between researchers and practitioners.  \nTourish (2020) argued that research papers are formulaic, cautious, dull, and often unreadable and \nthat academic writing often becomes a barrier as it excludes practitioners. Tourish’s critical \nobservation about management research also implies the relucta nce of practitioners to engage with"

This challenge in the research -practice gap calls for research on the investigation of the \neffectiveness of various knowledge translation strategies, inc luding professional, organizational, and \nregulatory approaches. Future research agendas (Beer, 2020; Fisher et al., 2021; Gioia, 2022), \ntherefore, include unraveling specific language and communication barriers, identifying effective \ntranslation strategies , and devising improved methods for presenting research findings that \nfacilitate timely and practical resources for HR practitioners.  \n \nTo effectively address real -world issues, researchers are encouraged to actively seek collaboration \nwith HR practitioners for a deeper contextual understanding of workplace challenges (Bleijenbergh \net al., 2021). Collaboration between the two is pivotal fo r identifying and prioritizing research topics \nthat resonate with the challenges HR practitioners encounter in the workplace. For instance, Gray et \nal. (2011) introduced the concept of mode 2 research, suggesting the formation of collaborative \nteams compri sing researchers and practitioners to address workplace issues together. Cho and \nEgan (2023) advocate for action -oriented research, wherein researchers and practitioners \ncollaborate in investigating complex problems at work, leading to mutual learning that  can inform \nfuture problem -solving efforts. Subsequent research initiatives should delve into the mechanisms \navailable and proven effective in facilitating collaboration between researchers and practitioners. \nThese mechanisms can support the continuous mon itoring and evaluation of the impact and \neffectiveness of research on HR programs and policies. Embracing this collaborative approach can \nsignificantly enhance the impact of evidence -based solutions on the workplace (Brown & Latham, \n2018; Lawler & Benson, 2022).  \n \nIn practice, our study findings offer insights and actionable guidance for human resources. HR \npractitioners are encouraged to seek research that aligns with their organizations’ specific \nchallenges, advocating for the seamless integration of research -base d practices into their \nworkflows. Recognizing the intrinsic value of research and maintaining active engagement with \naction -oriented research can empower practitioners to make informed decisions and improve the \nquality of HR practices in their organization s. In so doing, organizations should foster a culture of \nresearch -based decision -making to facilitate such integration between research and practice. \nActively nurturing collaboration among HR practitioners, researchers, and policymakers will attain \nthe goa l of breaking down the research -practice gap. Such collaborative endeavors will generate the \npossibility of enhancing effective HR management and development initiatives (de Frutos -Belizon et \nal., 2020; Vosburgh, 2022). For this collaboration to happen, HR  practitioners should remain open to \nworking closely with researchers, contributing practical insights, providing constructive feedback, \nand demonstrating a willingness to adapt research -based solutions to their organization’s needs \nand cultural context (B leijenbergh et al., 2021). Such partnerships will make research findings \napplicable and beneficial to HR practice.  \n \nKeywords:  the research -to-practice gap, HR practitioners, qualitative study  \n  \nReferences  \n \nBeer, M.

The field of educational technology has been researching \nhow to incorporate technology into education and training (Luckin & Cukurova, 2019; Seels & \nRichey, 2012), and the in tegration of technology has now become the hottest topic in all fields. HRD \nis no exception. As an interdisciplinary field combining disciplines such as education, management, \nand psychology (Jacobs, 1990, 2023), HRD must be sensitive to the change and eff ective use of \ntechnology to improve performance.  \n \nMany scholars have already encouraged the adoption of research methods using diverse \ntechnologies in the HRD field (Akdere et al., 2022; Yoon, 2018, 2021) and emphasized the integration \nof the latest technologies to support effective HRD and digital transformation in practice (Graßmann \n& Schermuly, 2021; Kim, 2022; Mulder, 2021; Yim, 2021). Nevertheless, few papers study how the \nlatest technology and AI are used in organizational practice. In particula r, in higher education, \nGeneration Z learners are already quickly adopting and using the latest technology in their \nlearning(Wang et al. 2021), while many educators are straggling to adapt technology as quickly as \nstudents (Michel -Villarreal et al., 2023).  \n \nJust as the use of technology in organizations is a still -exploring research field, the current state of \ntechnology and AI use in higher education remains a large gap in the literature (Zawacki -Richter et \nal., 2019). Therefore, this study explores the real ity of technology and AI utilization in higher \neducation, focusing on educators. Three research questions guide this study.  \n \n1) What difficulties and benefits do university faculty experience due to technological change \nand the emergence of AI?  \n2) How do university faculty recognize and respond to students using technology and AI in \ntheir classes?  \n3) How are university faculty integrating and utilizing technology and AI into their teaching \npractices?  \n4) How are university faculty integrating and utilizing technology and AI into their research \npractices?  \n5) What competencies do university faculty need to utilize technology and AI better?  \n \nQualitative research methods are suitable for studying underexplored topics where structured \nknowledge and theories do not yet exist (Creswell & Poth, 2016). Data is collected through semi -\nstructured interviews with 38 university faculty members recruited through purposeful sampling. \nInterviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed simultaneously with the collection. \nSeveral coding methods and constant comparison method are used to analyze the data (Charmaz, \n2006).  \n \nAs an adult learner and an educator of adult learners, it is important to study how higher education \neducators respond to the latest technological changes, the emergence of AI in practice, and how \nthey utilize them in teaching and research. The findings of  this study will be able to suggest the \ndirection of training for faculty in higher education to better respond to social and technological"

To address these challenges,  Bartunek (20220  has  proposed a solution  utilising  ‘ \ntransformative -systemic -collaborative projects’. This arrangement involves L&D researchers working  \nclosely with stakeholders  to explore complex phenomenon and generate actionable outcomes ( \nWilliams & Whiteman 2021). Th e L&D domain appears to be particularly well suited to provide \nactionable knowledge on organizational  and societal problems given its focus on investigating L&D \npractices and their implementation  in organisations.  Yet the reality is something different all \ntogether where L&D and HRD academics are focused on theory and discipline issues  and have \ngiven t he world  of practice a low priority ( Kougiannou & Ridgway, 2022).  \n \nCollaborative research can be understood as an umbrella concepts  and covers a variety of concepts \nsuccah s engaged  scholarship, action research and participatory research and Guerci et al (2023) \nhighlight that collaborative research can be focused on   technical,  practical and emancipatory \ninterests.  while these different approaches share common principles they  do have differences   \ndepending on who initiate the research process , the partners degree of involvement and the focus \non generating theoretica l knowledge ( Ellistrom et al 2020).  Despite the appeal of collaborative \nresearch,  it is inevitable that tensions will arise and is  significantly more challenging  than an \napproach led   by researchers alone.   This therefore explains where there are ca lls to better \nunderstand how to make collaborative research  work more productively.   \n \nIn this article, I argue that an integrative research  approach may provide an alternative   way for \nL&D research  to help bridge the theory -practice gap.  An integrative research approach is defined \nby Ellistrom et al  (2020)  as ‘ a collaborative research  approach  characterised by recurrent  \ninteractions and joint learning activities between researchers  and practitioners  in commonly \nagreed upon efforts  to study change and innovation on organisations’ ( p, 1520). The purpose of \nthis paper is threefold:  (1) to introduce  an integrative framework into L&D research (2) to describe \nthe lessons learned   from implementing such as  research  approach in three organisations over a  \nperiod of 4 years and involving 52 interviews with multiple L&D stakeholders or  actors. (3) to \naddress the skills and competencies that L&D researchers require for successful collaborative \nresearch.  In essence we provide insights on an approach to collaborative research that gives \nattention to theory generation and practice improvem ents,  leverages the roles of L&D researchers \nand practitioners who have different interests , responsibilities and competencies  and offers \ninsights into the interaction processes and enhanced joint learning in research and practice.  \nKeywords: L&D and collaborative research, an integrative research framework, competencies"

But with the \nemergence of the traumatic COVID -19 pandemic, the environment has recently s hifted to what a \nfuturist Jamais Cascio (2020) called BANI world where environments are brittle, anxious, nonlinear, \nand incomprehensible. Organizations need to adjust to this new reality and make sure that their \nemployees are equipped with knowledge, skil ls, and behaviors that will enable even more \nsuccessful performance if they want to survive and remain competitive in such an atmosphere.  \nOne of the key factors in determining an organization's success is innovation which could be \nfostered at an individual level through innovative mindset and behavior. Innovative work behavior \n(IWB) is the process by which employees develop, adopt, and imple ment new ideas for goods/ \nservices, technology, and working procedures. According to earlier research, innovative work \nbehavior is positively related to employees' task performance. However, task performance is \ntypically defined by job descriptions and doe s not take into account employees’ ability to adapt and \ncope with dynamic and unprecedented challenges which reflect current work environment. \nTherefore, adaptive performance, a more recent construct which is simply described as employees' \ncapability to ad apt to rapidly changing work situations has been introduced by researchers. It is \ninteresting to investigate if, aside from task performance, innovative work behavior could also be \nassociated with adaptive performance.  \n \nFurthermore, studies discovered that organizations needed positive or optimistic employees who \ncould thrive under the most trying circumstances to guarantee long -term business competitiveness \nand success. It is, therefore, more crucial than ever to develop  positive -minded employees and \ncreate a positive workplace. Among many factors, Psychological Capital (PsyCap), which is defined \nas an individual’s positive psychological state of development characterized by self -efficacy, \noptimism, hope, and resilience, might be useful to address the issue as it can be measured, \ndeveloped, and managed to improve performance. Based on Broaden -and-Build theory by \nFredrickson (1998) which posits that positive emotions will make a person more conscious and \ninspire them to thi nk and act in new ways, PsyCap may influence employees’ innovative work \nbehavior which in turn could impact adaptive performance.  \n \nThe purpose of this research is to investigate the relationships among psychological capital, \ninnovative work behavior, and adaptive performance with data collected from full -time employees \nworking in start -up companies in Thailand through online questionn aires.  \n \nThe findings of this research will not only contribute to HRD domain by extending our \nunderstanding of psychological capital, innovative work behavior, and adaptive performance \nliterature, but also provide practitioners with actionable insights as all variable s in this research can \nbe managed and developed.  \n \nKeywords:  Innovative Work Behavior, Psychological Capital, Adaptive Performance, Start -up"

In practice, this is a result of the many degree \nprograms that now cater to “non -traditional” and adult studen ts as well as the increased availability \nof online programs. These programs allow students who are caring for children, working full time, \nor managing other life issues to obtain a college education (Kasworm et al., 2010). Despite the \nastronomical growth o f this demographic of college students, historical support systems that have \nsupported the “traditional” student have not kept pace. For example, student academic advising \nservices are still largely focused on younger people with fewer obligations outside of the classroom. \nWhile some scholarship has been done in this area (e.g. Akers, et al., 2021; Roessger et al., 2019), \nthere is a need to develop frameworks and models for supporting adult students in their college \nexperience. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model for advising non -traditional college \nstudents based on a human resource development (HRD) framework. Much like HRD advances \npractices like mentoring, coaching, self -directed learning, micro -learning, and other concepts, I \nbelieve the fie ld of HRD can make a valuable contribution to the scholarship on non -traditional \ncollege students. Though HRD has focused on the workplace learner (Garavan et al., 2002; Park & \nLee, 2018), they share many characteristics with the adult college student, I a rgue. Thus, an \ninterdisciplinary model that applies HRD theory to college student advising could be fruitful.  \n \nReferences  \nAkers, R., Carter, J., & Coder, D. (2021).

The recent growth in \ngenerative artificial intelligence software such as ChatGBT has further challenged traditio nal \nmethods of assessment, such as essays or questions of a more general nature (Moqbel & Al -Kadi, \n2023).  \n \nOverall aim and purpose  \nThis working paper explores the implications of these changes for staff development relating to \npedagogy in Higher Education, particularly in assessment design.  \n \nTheoretical underpinnings  \nAssessment as a vehicle for learning as well as a measurement of that learning. (Evans, 2013; \nO’Leary, 2014) should not be underestimated. Indeed, assessment for or as learning with a strong \nfocus on the learning process and providing feedback as part of a  formative or summative \nassessment task has been recognised to improve achievement, and skills development, including \nautonomy within a social dimension (O’Leary, 2014). In addition, assessment for or as learning can \nplay a role in improving assessment lit eracy i.e. students’ ability to engage successfully in the \nprocess (Smith et al., 2013).  \n \nThe emergence of generative artificial intelligence(GAI) is causing concerns in relation to \nassessment, particularly those focused on products e.g. written assignments and exam (Moqbel & \nAl-Kadi, 2023). Stobart (2023) questions the validity of evaluating s kills through traditional tests.  \nRecent papers on ChatGPT express concerns about plagiarism and the authenticity of students’ \nwork (see Rudolph, Tan & Tan, 2023; Kasneci et al, 2023). Moqbel & AL -Kadi (2023) suggest that \nAcademic integrity can be protected through using alternative types of assessment such as: \nperformance -based tasks, self -assessment, peer -assessment, portfolio and   teacher observation.  \nTraditional assessment practices such as exams and essays will need to change in response to both \nthe changing role of assessment, within the curriculum, and the increasing availability of generative \nAI. \n \nMethodology  \nBased on a narrative literature review relating to changes in assessment practices post -pandemic \nwithin HE, including the impact of the recent emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence on \nthese practices, the paper will examine key changes to assessm ent design principles and associated \npractices.  \n \nIn conclusion, this working paper will consider the changing role of assessment and the implications \nfor professional practice within HE.  \n \nKeywords:  Assessment, Higher Education, Professional Education Practice"

      "text": "262 \nID:205 - Becoming change agents at University: challenges and opportunity  \nConcetta Tino & Monica Fedeli  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nAt the University of Padua, thanks to a professional development programme that started in 2016, \nhas begun a process of change, detecting significant transformations within teaching processes. \nContributing to this process of change were not only individuals, but also those teachers who \nvoluntarily have chosen to follow a dedicated training path to be able to play the role of Change \nAgent (CA ) within their departments and the University Community. Exercising the role of CA in the \nPadua reality implies intersecting two trajectories and crossing the boundaries of two realities: the \ninternal reality of the departments and the broader \"external\" r eality, that is the University \nCommunity. In this context acting the role of CA means operating in ways:  on the one hand, as \nfacilitators, mentors and animators of innovation for colleagues in their own departments, \ngenerating comparison and discussion on  innovation of teaching/learning processes; on the other \nhand, as boundary spanners (Akkerman, & Bakker, 2011), as they are called to cross the boundaries \nof their department and their fields of knowledge to co -construct new sharing objects, made of \npracti ces, experiences, experimentation of methods and initiatives, in an attempt to contaminate \nthe methods and processes of teaching and learning, as well as to open new perspectives within the \nindividual Professional Learning Communities (PLCs). In fact, this  is precisely their role: to promote \ncontinuous professional development (CPD) among the teaching staff of their department through \nthe care and growth of PLCs who can facilitate the transition from individual to collaborative \nprofessional development, cre ating a space where everyone can experience processes of sharing \nand mutual support (Cordingley et al., 2015), where everyone can recognize critical reflection as a \ndetermining factor that fuels and makes innovation and change sustainable, as well as the \nprofessional growth of teachers (Stanley , 2011). The construction of PLCs is recognized as the most \neffective strategies to promote continuous and collaborative professional development (Vangrieken \net al., 2017), where the role of facilitators becomes cruc ial for the growth and evolution of \ncommunities. The most important task therefore for change agents is to promote the development \nof PLCs as the key to sustainable change within their institutions. The study, through a qualitative \napproach, sought to expl ore: (i) What changes in learning and teach have experienced after training \nas a CA? (ii) What challenges do they have faced within their departments? (iii)What elements need \nto be considered for the sustainability of a Learning Community?  \n \nKeywords:  Change Agent; Change; Professional Learning community, teaching innovation; \nchallenges"

Purpose:  \nThe purpose of this paper is to disseminate and report first -hand data collected by graduate \nstudents as course assignments starting from 2007 to 2019. Every semester, students were \ninstructed and guided in a class assignment to interview an HRD/HRM practi tioner using the same \nunaltered questionnaire for 10 years. The purpose of the assignment was for the students to gain \nknowledge regarding some practices in the field of HRD/HRM as opposed to academic theories that \nare accessible through a review of litera ture and classwork. Class discussions took place using \ncompiled documentation containing all the answers so the students could benefit from all the \nrespondents’ practices.  \n \n2. Theoretical Base  \nHuman Resource Development (HRD) has become a field of study and practice. In this perspective, \nHRD has developed various and multiple models and approaches for scholars and practitioners to \nutilize as frameworks. Theory is particularly important to a disc ipline that is emerging and growing \n(Chalofsky, 1990; Ruona, 2000; Torraco, 2005). While practitioners need many theories in their \ntoolkit, scholars of HRD seek an encompassing theory to define and guide the profession.  \nThe following two definitions from HRD scholars capture the essence of theory and the challenge \nfacing our profession:  \n \n1. “A theory simply explains what a phenomenon is and how it works” (Torraco, 1997, p. 115).  \n2. “Theory building is the process or recurring cycle by which coherent descriptions, \nexplanations and representations of observed or experienced phenomena are generated, verified, \nand refined”(Lynham, 2000b, p. 160). Theory building uses scientific methods to analyze a \nphenomenon, an event, or a behavior.  \n \n3.Methodology  \nEvery semester, students are instructed and guided in a class assignment to interview an HRD \npractitioner using the same unaltered questionnaire. The instructions to the students were to \nidentify a Human Resource Development professional, a Training professional or Organization \nDevelopment professional or any other person who can provide them with answers regarding the \nfunctioning of HRD in their organization (profit or non -profit). They had to write a paragraph about \nthe title of the person to interview and his/her job as well as their organization. Students were also \ninstructed n ot mention names or any other personal information regarding the person or the \ncompany. They interview the person using the questionnaire provided by the instructor. The \nstudents were instructed to record the answers under the question and submit the compl eted \nquestionnaire via BlackBoard platform as an assignment. The questionnaire was composed of 20 \nquestions. Some of the questions were:  \n \n1. What kind of qualifications a person in your department should have that would make them \nmore successful in the HRD field?  \n2.  How often does your department do training?  \n3.  What challenges do you face during the recruiting and retention process?  \n4. How often does your Human Resources Department, update training materials?  \n5. Do you have any experience in training employees for global employment?"

Data  \nThe data collected is presented as follows:  \nEvery semester about 300 responses regarding HRD practices are collected (15 students X 20 \nquestions). With an average of 15 students every semester during a period of 10 years (22 \nsemesters), the total number of respondents is 330 HRD practitioners or 330  questionnaires to \nanalyze (660 answers). The following is an example of data to be analyzed by practice:   \n• Recruiting and retention (challenges, courses needed outside HRD, internal hiring vs \nexternal),  \n• Training ( frequency, training materials updates, needs assessment, global training),  \n• Daily legal issues (training and disciplinary actions when an employee is failing, types of \ndaily legal issues,).  \n• Most important aspects of the job.  \n• Performance improvement undertaken, turnover and design of motivation, most popular \nreward for employees.  \n• Methods used in training (internet/online, teleconferences, face -to- face, handouts, Power \nPoint presentations, etc.)  \nThe last question: “What do you think is the most challenging issue facing the HRD field today?” will \nbe treated and analyzed separately as a non - practice.  \nTable: Examples from 2010 and 2022 Answers to Question 11.  \nQuestion 11: What type of legal issues do you face on a daily basis?  \n          2010  Question 11:What type of legal issues do you face on a daily basis?  \n          2016  Question 11:What type of legal issues do you face on a daily basis?  \n          2022  \n• Anything having to do with ADA, FMLA, or the perception of discrimination and/or unfair \npractices or decisions.  \n• Terminations related issues, discipline issues, and dealings with the EEOC.  \n• Traffic tickets for parking and accidents caused by our drivers.  \n• There are lots of legal issues that HR department faces on a daily basis, for example, \nemployment and background verification, harassment, information security issues, disability \ndefinitions and accommodations etc.  \n• Privacy act laws, equal opportunity laws, fair wage laws, discrimination laws  \n• When it comes to training issues, the two biggest legal issues I face are Fiscal Law and Labor \nRelations issues.  Using allotted money legally is a large part of this job, and if anyone has a \ncomplaint then LR will step in.  \n• We deal with the Family Medical Leave Act, Child Support, and the local authorities if an \nemployee has gotten into trouble  \n• One legal issue I face is to not discriminate on the basis of gender or age.

An Exploration of Learning within Small \nand Medium -Sized Enterprises  \n \nJudith Woods, Martin McCracken  & Ian Smyth  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nPapers Importance  \nHow organisations are categorised typically takes size -based definitions in terms of employee \nheadcount, turnover and balance sheet. The category of small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) \nis made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and  which have an annual \nturnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 \nmillion euro (EC, 2005; OECD, 2023).  \n \nWith approximately 5.97 million SMEs operating within the UK (ILO, 2023 ) and accounting for two \nthirds of all jobs worldwide, SMEs play a key role in our national and global economies (FSB, 2020; \nDepartment for International Trade, 2020; ILO, 2023). Howev er, from an academic perspective \nSME’s are often categorised homogenously despite evidence of heterogeneity with ‘SME’ label used \nubiquitously without an understanding of the differences inherent within the SME category itself \n(DIE, 2013).   \n \nAs Porter (1985) outlines, both small and large firms can effectively capture niche markets, while \nmedium ‐sized firms are ‘stuck in the middle’ in the sense that they can be less competitive than \ntheir counterparts in either end of the firm size distribution. Conversely, other research has shown \nthat medium -sized businesses can have a higher growth potential t han small businesses due to \ntheir greater resources and ability to access financing (North, 2011). In light of such clear variations \nin the ways in wh ich SMEs operate it is perhaps naïve and ill -informed to assume that learning \nwithin small versus medium sized enterprises is one and the same. With markedly different \nresource bases and organisational needs firms within the SME continuum are unlikely to e ngage in \nHRD in the same way. With limited research breaking down the SME definition (references) and \nexploring HRD across the SME size spectrum we are left with a significant gap in our knowledge and \nunderstanding.  \n  \nTheoretical base  \nTo help us fully understand the issues connected to this research we utilised two primary \ntheoretical lenses.  The first of these was the well -established Life Cycle Theory (Greiner, 1972; \nCameron and Whetten, 1981), which proposes that there are a series of ‘expansion’ stages and \nresultant ‘crises’, that organisations proceed through during their lifecycles, from an initial creative \nphase to expansion through collaboration. Although many contributions have augmented this basic \ntheory since its initial ince ption, designed to add more practical implications for organisations in \ndifferent sectors with a range of revenue contingencies (Flamholtz and Randle, 2007; Mosca et al, \n2021), the basic premise that an incremental movement is observed for organisations as  they grow \nthrough these phases has been consistent.  \n \nIn this research, the aim is to apply our knowledge of HRD needs and application to understand \nwhat type of training and development practices are most appropriate at different points during the \norganisational lifecycle. This is where the second major theo retical base for this study comes in, \nlinked to informal and incidental learning (Marsick and Volpe,1999; Marsick and Watkins, 1990).  \nConventional wisdom would advocate that by their nature SMEs and particularly those \norganisations towards the smaller end  of the size spectrum, will employ more informal and"

However, such \nan assumption has not been addressed in empirical research and the nuances associated with \nunderstanding effective HRD and learning strategy, especially amon gst a range of organisations \nwhich range in size from micro (under 10 employees) to those at the larger end of the SME \nspectrum (over 200 employees) has received scant attention.  \n   \nResearch Purpose  \nWith HRD research in SMEs having received comparatively less attention than HRD in a more \ngeneral sense (Nolan and Garavan, 2016) and even less work conducted on HRD in firms of varying \nsizes along the SME spectrum there is a clear impetus for research tha t explores the nuances of \nlearning within these contexts.  Eliciting a greater appreciation of the HRD techniques and \ninterventions and how they differ within small versus medium sized enterprises has the potential to \nmake a significant contribution to kno wledge in the field. Furthermore, value is also derived more \nbroadly as we highlight the necessity of adopting a more nuanced approach to research within the \nSME categorisation and illustrate the limitations of broadly generalising behaviours and experienc es \namong firms within the SME landscape. Finally we offer insights and practical guidance on HRD \ninterventions and their efficacy for firms of varying sizes within the SME context.  \n \nResearch question/s  \nThe ultimate aim of this study is to explore the nuances of learning within the SME spectrum and \nconsequently our research questions are threefold:  \n1.How do HRD interventions and techniques differ within the small/micro sized enterprise vs the \nmedium sized enterprise?  \n2.From the perspective of the firm what is the rationale for the interventions and techniques \nemployed by small vs medium sized enterprises?  \n3.How can HRD interventions be better tailored to meet the learning demands and resource \nprofiles of firms within the SME categorisation?  \n \nIn pursuit of answers to these questions we are interested in exploring the application of qualitative \nresearch methods as both a means of understanding the complexity of learning within the small - \nand medium -sized firm as well as generate a more fine grai ned insight into HRD interventions and \ntechniques employed by different sized firms within the SME category.     \nOur insights are be based on 18 qualitative interviews among 4 case firms. The case firms in \nquestion are drawn across the SME size spectrum and interviews were conducted among \nemployees as well as managerial staff allowing for a more holistic and multi -level consideration and \nexploration of the research questions posed.  \n \nImplications for HRD practice  \nGiven existing research calls for further understanding of HRD practices in SMEs (Skinner and \nPowell, 2003; Nolan and Garavan, 2016), it is pertinent from the practitioner perspective to \nunderstand the full gamut of developmental activity as it relates to differences in firm size across \nmicro, small and medium categories of firm size (Saunders, Gray, and Goregaokar, 2014).  Short \n(2019) argues that SMEs should not be treated as a homogenous group. Therefore, whether size is \ncausal or merely correlative, a b etter appreciation of differences in resources, scale, and \norganizational structures as they relate to HRD practices is necessary.   \n \nConclusions  \nDriven by a lack of nuanced research in the SME context and, more notably the assumed \nhomogeneity in terms of the nature of learning and HRD among firms across the SME spectrum, \nthis paper makes an important distinction and thus offers a unique insight int o SME learning and \nHRD. Focusing on 4 case study firms  we illustrate the variations in HRD techniques and \ninterventions employed by firms at the multiple points along the SME spectrum."

Particularly, as employees subjectively interpret \ntheir experiences within the organization and derive meaning from their work, they actively manage \nand advance their careers in a voluntary manner (Savickas, 2013). Therefore, it is crucial to ensure \nthat employees recognize their organization's provision of supportive reso urces for career \nadvancement (Joo et al., 2023).  \n \nAs the concept of lifelong employment within an organization fades in many countries, welfare \nbenefits emerge as a crucial aspect of human resource management strategy. Employee attitudes \ntowards both career development and the organization are influenced by various workplace factors \nwith their job fitness (Edwards, 1991; Uzair et al., 2017). It is important for employees to receive \nfairly the rewards for their efforts in performing their work and the o pportunities provided to them \n(Colquitt, 2011; Yanik & Gürsoy, 2015). Moreover, transparent HR practices are anticipated to result \nin high performance (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Wright & Nishii, 2007). Therefore, it is meaningful to \nexamine the effectiveness of fairness in performance appraisal to employee attitudes.  \nEmployees perceive their careers as indicators of growth within the organization, and it becomes \nessential to shape a career identity rooted in self -awareness (Savickas, 2012; Valcour & Ladge, \n2008). This identity not only fosters confidence but also enhan ces adaptability within their careers. \nGeneration Z actively seek challenging tasks and gravitate towards work that aligns with their values \n(Barhate & Dirani, 2021). Moreover, given their inclination towards a boundaryless approach to \ncareer development, when they perceive their organization as supportive of their career growth and \nfind their tasks meaningful and challenging, employees are likely to believe in their ability to \ncontinually manage and develop their careers.  \n \nMeanwhile, SMEs in Korea often offer less favorable working conditions compared to larger \nenterprises and are susceptible to future labor market risks (Ko, 2021). Furthermore, employees in \nSMEs receive differential resources based on their employment type (Cho et al., 2008). The quality \nof employees' experiences is contingent upon their employment type, considering varying work \nconditions such as training and development opportunities, and welfare benefits. In other words, it \nmay lead to variations in caree r development behaviors based on their employment type.  \nTherefore, to foster the career development of generation Z employees, it is imperative to examine \nthe influential relationship between the limited support environment and job perception. \nSpecifically, comparing groups can illuminate the antecedent factors  that play a decisive role, \ndepending on the employment type.  \n \nTheoretical base  \nOrganizational support is a pivotal factor influencing employees' job performance and shaping \nemployee’s behavior (Zare, 2012). Our study focused on self -efficacy and adaptability from the \nperspective of career development (Lent & Hackett, 1987; Savickas, 1997). We also considered"

Among the determinants affecting their career development, we \nfocused the organizational welfare system (Donahue et al., 2000; Jong, 2023), organizational justice \n(Murphy & Cleveland, 1995; Jawahar, 2007), and job fitness (Cable & DeRue, 2002). We applied \norganizational support theory (Eisenberger et al., 1986) and social cognitive career theory (Hackett \n& Betz, 1981) to theoretic ally discuss the relationship.  \n \nEmployees evaluate whether the organization adequately provides career support opportunities \nand systems.

This study focuses on \ngeneration Z within small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Due to the specificity of organizational \ncontext and generational character istics, our comparative approach contributes to expand the \ntheoretical discussion by integrating organizational support and career theory.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThe purpose of our study is to provide customized career development interventions for \nemployees, taking into consideration their employment type in SMEs in South Korea. In align with \nthe purpose, we examined the structural relationships between organizati onal support system, \nfairness of performance appraisal, person -job fitness, organizational and career attitudes. \nSpecifically, we would like to derive the strategic interventions that empower employees, recognized \nas essential organizational assets, to pro actively manage their career and cultivate a positive \nworkplace experience.  \n  \nImplications for HRD practice  \nIn the context of South Korea, characterized by an abnormal organizational structure and employee \nratio, we anticipate that our findings will enhance awareness of career development among \nemployees, considering their employment type. Additionally, these results are expected  to \ncontribute to an overall improvement in workplace satisfaction. By exploring organizational factors, \nincluding the organizational support system and fairness of performance appraisal, as well as \nindividual factors such as person -job fit, based on emplo yment type, we can identify the relative \nimportance of these factors in shaping employees' perceptions of career development. Identifying \nthese factors is crucial in aligning with organizational development strategies. Furthermore, by \nleveraging responses from generation Z employees, our study contributes to expanding the \ndiscourse on the career development characteristics of generation Z, building upon previous \ndiscussions (Barhate & Dirani, 2022).  \n \nConclusion  \nThis study conducted multi -group, considering employment type, to investigate the differences in \nthe influence of factors determining the perception of career development and organizational \nsatisfaction among SMEs in South Korea.

Developing employees’ career and \naligning it with the organization's values and goals is the first step toward mutual growth between \nemployees and the organization.

Prior research has predominantly focused on the direct \nimpact of training and development on SME performance, often overlooking the complex \nexperiences and k nowledge transfer processes among SME leaders. The existing literature \nfrequently falls short in investigating the dynamic of SME leaders’ knowledge transfer and their \ntranslation into practical organizational change and improvement.  \n \nImportance  \nThis paper identifies insight into SME leader training program on how they transfer knowledge and \ntranslate into business results. The research findings contribute to the HRD field in terms of filling a \ngap in the academic literature and offering recommendation s for training SME leaders.  \n \nTheoretical Base  \nThe study employs multiple theoretical frameworks. The (Nonaka et al., 2000) SECI model involves \nthe transformation of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. The model consists of four \ncomponents: socialization, externalization, combination, and internal ization. This SECI model helps \nin comprehending how SME leaders leverage personal knowledge exchange in the program for \ntheir organizational gain.  \nSocial Capital Theory (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998) offers insights into how the SME training \nenvironment functioned as a social network, facilitating knowledge sharing and application. The \ntheory focuses on the value came from social networks and relationships . In fact, this theory \nexplains how close relationship of the SME leaders in the class help to facilitate knowledge sharing \namong leaders.  \nFurthermore, Adult Learning Theory (Knowles, 1975) highlights the importance of practical and \nproblem -centered learning experiences. Adult Learning Theory (Knowles, 1975), explains the \nconcept of self -directed learning. Additionally, adults like to learn t hings that solve their real -life \nproblems. This theory is particularly relevant in understanding how SME leaders, who are adult \nlearners, engage with and benefit from practical, experiential learning processes like those offered \nin SME leader training.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nThe purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the learning experiences \nof Thai SME leaders participating in the SME Leader program,  which was designed to support SMEs \nin Thailand that were impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic.

We \nanalyzed the interview transcripts and mind maps, then broke them down  into 446 codes which \nwere grouped into seven main themes. To address trustworthiness, we used triangulation across \nresearchers and member checking.  \n \nKey Findings  \nBased on interviews with 12 SME leaders, their learning experiences in the SME leader training \nprogram were captured by six themes, which were separated into three overarching themes: \ntraining design, training catalyst, and training environment.  \nTraining Design consists of 5 themes, business challenges, learning material.  work assignment, \ndiagnostic tools, and continuous business improvement. Training Catalyst includes 2 themes, \nmotivation to learn and building trust. Training Environment is the learning environment in mix of \nformal and informal workshop/coach for social knowledge exchange.  \n Figure 1 Learning Model  \nBased on the figure 1, SME leaders’ learning journey loop start by learning their own “business \nchallenges”, for example, gap operational efficiency, market competition, financial management, \npeople management or business disruption. They experience the de sign of the leadership program \nhelp them understand the issues they face in their day -to-day business operations.  \nAdditionally, the opportunity to communicate their business challenges and apply program \nknowledge to address them “motivate” the trainees to learn, which is what is meant by the term \n\"training catalyst.\"  \n \nIn terms of the \"training environment,\" the participants perceived the coaching or workshop as a \ncollaborative, open learning environment. Leaders benefit from this environment's “social \nknowledge exchanges” with business -experienced coaches and classmates . It is enabling them to \nexchange implicit information and provide useful, practical guidance on how to solve problems.  \nThe idea of \"building trust\" is evident when trainees believe instructors are competent and capable \nof assisting SMEs in resolving issues. The connection of trust that develops between leaders and \ntrainers via education serves as a catalyst for the sharing  of ideas between trainees and trainers.  \nTrusting in trainers’ knowledge and willingness to help SME leaders solve problems motivates the \nSME leaders to exercise the knowledge in their organizations through a training design of “work \nassignments” and other “learning materials” (e.g., self -assessm ent, exercises, and “diagnostic tools”). \nTherefore, they can identify the problems in their businesses and improve their business outcomes.  \n  \nFinally, \"continuous business improvement and changes\" refers to the trainees' observation of the \nresults of the adjustments they have made through learning periods. Leaders were motivated to \nshare these insights back in the classroom when they saw positiv e changes in their businesses, \nresulting in a dynamic learning loop.  \nImplications for HRD Practice  \n \nThe findings have significant implications for Human Resource Development (HRD) practices in \nSMEs. The study suggests that effective SME leader training programs design should focus on real -\nworld challenges with tools and framework that will help the learn er to self -diagnosis their problem. \nEmphasizing building trust between instructors and learners.

Additionally, changes in the business context exert modifications in the way \ncompa nies function, which makes it necessary to provide employees with development \nopportunities. Such a situation, refers in particular to SMEs operating on international markets \n(ISMEs), as the number of factors that determine running the business is very div ersified and \ncomplex. This requires paying attention to T&D practices offered to employees to meet both \ndomestic and foreign markets expectations. According to Francioni et al. (2016) and Paul et al. \n(2017) there is a knowledge gap concerning HRM practices  in the context of SME \ninternationalisation.  \n \nTheoretical base  \nSMEs play an important role in economies of all countries and they are very active in building \ninternational cooperation. However, agreements very often cover a relatively low value of traded \ngoods or services (WTO, 2016). Being a part of international trade can be very fruitful for SMEs, as  \ncooperation with companies from other countries may positively impact turnover, employment and \ninnovation (European Comission, 2010). These benefit s cause that the number of internationally \nactive companies in the European Union has continuously been rising since 2014 (OECD 2022). \nNevertheless, analyses of SMEs international activity made it possible to identify nearly fifty types of \nbarriers that sm all and medium enterprises may encounter, among which human resource barriers \nwere indicated (OECD, n.d.).  \n \nThe lack of adequate systems and procedures of managing employees can be a real obstacle, \nbecause human capital which consists of skills, abilities, and competencies is perceived as a critical \nsource of  competitive advantage (Bhattacharya et al. 2014) and  that is why human resources in \nSMEs are in focus of theoretical, empirical and practical attention (Sheehan, 2014). This resource -\nbased view perspective represents a current paradigm on firm competitiveness. It conceptualises \nthe organisation as a collect ion of competencies and draws attention to issues of learning, HRD \ninvestment, knowledge accumulation and experience (Garavan et al. 2001). Actions aimed at \nemployees’ learning and gaining new knowledge can be executed by T&D activities that SMEs \norganise.  This type of activities is of high importance in the case of ISMEs as the ability to acquire \nknowledge and develop internationalisation capabilities influences performance (Hilmersson & \nJohanson, 2020). However, research states that T&D practices in SMEs are underdeveloped (Pauli, \n2020), and that they are executed mostly in an informal way (Tam and Gray 2016; Short and Gray \n2018), which may make the effectiveness of the whole process lower than in large entities.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nEntering foreign markets or intensifying international activities requires competences suitable not \nonly for running a business on home country market but also those that correspond with foreign \nmarkets conditions. That is why, ISMEs should provide their e mployees with T&D opportunities and \nwhat is more, these activities should be properly organised to assure the expected level of \nperformance. The main purpose of this article is to investigate how T&D activities are executed in \nISMEs, what factors may shape  undertaken activities and whether the way T&D is performed \nimpacts performance."

The business case for CSR suggests that the benef icial returns of investment in \nCSR depends on the capacity of CSR activity to increase the strength and quality of the relationship \nbetween the organisation and its stakeholders (Barnett 2007; Bhattacharya et al. 2009).  Over the \npast decade, employees’ at titudes and behaviours in response to employees’ perceptions of CSR \nhave received increasing attention by scholars. Specifically, within the CSR literature, efforts to \nunlock the ‘black box’ between firms CSR and performance outcomes have led to a number o f \nstudies that explore how employee attitudes and behaviours (micro -level influencers) respond to \nmacro -level CSR initiatives.  Despite Aguinis’ and Glavas’ (2012) call for ‘multi -level’ perspectives, \nincluding a person -centric focus to CSR, and an integra tion of diverse theoretical frameworks, the \nCSR-performance literature remains highly fragmented.  \n \nUtilising multi -level, longitudinal data, we focus on one dimension of CSR – firm’s Green HRM \n(GHRM) practices - which reflect ‘those HRM practices aligned with environmental sustainability \ngoals and which aim at developing employees’ abilities, commitment  and motivation, and \ninvolvement of staff in support of those goals at the firm level’ (Jackson et al., 2011; O’Donohue and \nTorugsa, 2016: p. 240; Renwick et al., 2013) to analyse whether there is a positive association \nbetween GHRM and labour productivity , in the context of small and medium sized enterprises \n(SMEs).  While the SME HRM -firm performance literature has gradually been developing, in \nparticular, in the past 10 years (eg Sheehan and Garavan 2022), very few studies have examined \npotential GHRM -firm performance within SMEs (see O’Donohue and Torugsa, 2016 for a notable \nexception).  \n \nInformed by evolutionary resource -based theory (ERBT) (Boxall & Steeneveld, 1999; Muller, 1996; \nSheehan and Garavan, 2022) and Social Identity Theory (SIT) (DeRoeck and Maon’s (2018) we will \nempirically test whether psychological foundations of GHRM impact s upon labour productivity in \nSMEs.  The micro -foundations examined are: Employee Attitudes (organisational commitment; \norganisational identification; job satisfaction); employees’ voluntary workplace green behaviours \n(EVGBs) (Kim et al., 2016) (the mediat ing variables); and employees’ perceptions of the firm’s \nenvironmental commitment (P -EC) (Raineri and Paille (2016)) (the moderating variable). This study \nfocuses on firm labour productivity as the intended outcome of GHRM. Reviews of the SME \nliterature (e g Dhawan, 2001; Owalla et al. 2021) highlight the importance of productivity as an \norganisational performance measure to SMEs and that SMEs face significant challenges which make \nproductivity gain even more important albeit more challenging than is the cas e in larger firms.   \n \nThe working hypotheses are as follows:  \nH1: MD’s environmental commitment (EC) is positively associated with GHRM.  \nH2: GHRM is positively associated with labour productivity.  \nH3: Employees’ attitudes are positively associated with labour productivity.  \nH4: Employees’ voluntary green behaviours (EVGBs) are positively associated with labour \nproductivity.  \nH5: EAs and EVGBs serially mediate the relationship between GHRM and labour productivity."

      "text": "284 \nID:200  - Employee Churn Prediction in commercial aviation companies in \nPortugal  \nAntónio Brito, Maria José Sousa  & Ana Moreira  \n \nABSTRACT  \nEmployee churn occurs when an employee leaves voluntarily from a company. Differently from the \nconcept of turnover, which represents all the workforce that leaves a company, voluntarily or not, \nchurn is not only voluntary as it is implicit that that loss f or the company does not have \nreplacement. Finally, churn, differently from other concepts that are used interchangeably as \n“turnover” or “attrition”, deals more with the financial consequences of an employee loss (Pirrolas, \nCorreia & Nascimento, 2022). “Ch urn”, “turnover” or “attrition” are concepts that are used \ninterchangeably, but in fact are different, except “attrition” that is used commonly as synonym. The \ncosts of an employee's departure are various, and are not only the training costs, but the costs  of \nfinding another employee of the same value, the knowledge lost to a competitor, the loss of value in \ngeneral. Alternatively, the construct \"turnover intention\" is used, instead of the employee's \ndeparture when it actually happens. The variable \"turnove r intentions\" represents the employee's \npropensity to leave his organization (Ali et al, 2022; Rombaut & Guerry, 2018) not the act in itself. \nTurnover intention is found to be the best antecedent to actual turnover (Griffeth, Hom & Gaertner, \n2000; Joseph e t al. 2007). Job satisfaction is a concept that has been studied for many years and \nwith thousands of contributions. The concept is not certain as job satisfaction is something different \nfrom person to person and involves several dimensions of analysis. Jo b satisfaction can be \nassociated with a set of feelings, cognitions, beliefs, and attitudes that people have in relation to \ntheir work. It is a set of positive or negative feelings (Armstrong, 2006; Huang et al. 2016; Spector, \n1997; Vroom, 1964). There are  also various types of job satisfaction. When it comes to the aviation \nsector, the topic of turnover is complex and nuanced. In some cases, namely in some job roles and \ntype of aviation activity/ or company, turnover is high (Efthymiou et al. 2021), as in others, it is not \nso high. There are few studies on the subject of employee churn in the commercial aviation sector. \nAlso there are few studies that correlate employee satisfaction with turnover intentions in the \ncommercial aviation sector. The methodology  of this study was first to define the constructs \n“employee churn”, “job satisfaction” and “turnover intentions”. Next was the step of finding in the \nliterature the most common factors associated with employee churn. Also it was searched in the \nliterature the subject of turnover in the commercial aviation sector. The result of the review was \nvarious types of job satisfaction and the most common research topics in the academic field for the \nsubject of turnover in aviation. The next step was to build a resear ch model based on literature \nfindings. The main hypothesis were established based on different kinds of satisfaction and the \nmost common factors associated with employee churn. A sample of 370 valid responses from \npeople working in the commercial aviation sector was used to assess which factors were most \nassociated with employee churn and which strongest associations existed between the variables. \nMultiple linear regression was used for data analysis. The results show that the participants in this \nstudy are  satisfied with security and their manager but that their satisfaction with their career, \nwork/life balance and pay are below the center point of the scale. The job group has a significant \neffect on employee satisfaction, as well as on their intentions to leave and perceived performance. \nPNTs are the most satisfied with their careers, security and pay. They also have the highest \nperception of their performance and the fewest intentions to leave. Those who are most satisfied \nwith reconciling work and persona l life are the M&E workers, and those who have the most \nsignificant intention of leaving are the participants in the group of ground workers. Seniority \nsignificantly affects satisfaction with career, management, work/life balance and intentions to leave. \nParticipants who have worked for the organization for less than a year have the highest career \nsatisfaction. Participants who have worked for the organization for a year are the most satisfied \nwith their manager and work/life balance. Participants who have worked for the organization for"

Additionally, it tests the indirect effects from intrinsic motivation. Data \nwere collected from 419 Korean employees working in different small and medium -sized companies \nin South Korea via an online and offline sur veys. The survey responses were evaluated using partial \nleast squares structural equation modeling (PLS -SEM) with the SmartPLS 4.0 program. All proposed \nhypotheses were confirmed in this study. The main findings of the study indicate that \ntransformational leadership is significantly and positively related to organizational innovation, with \nthis relationship being mediated by employee creativity. The results also indicated that the indirect \neffect of transformational leadership on organizational innovation t hrough employee creativity was \nmoderated by intrinsic motivation. This study offers new insights into the effects of \ntransformational leadership, intrinsic motivation, and employee creativity on organizational \ninnovation in Korean organizations. It is valu able for leaders, managers, and other HR management \nspecialists. Based on the findings, some implications are proposed to assist leaders of small and \nmedium -sized companies in enhancing leadership to improve intrinsic motivation and employee \ncreativity, th ereby fostering organizational innovation.  \n \nImportance of Study  \nIn today's fast -paced business environment, innovation has long been considered a main objective \nfor many organizations and has the potential for powerful influence on organizational growth and \ndevelopment (Mumford, 2002). To achieve innovation, business o rganizations need to have a \nmotivated, stable, and nimble workforce that enables the enterprise to stay relevant and adaptable \nin a dynamic and changing economic climate. As leaders can influence their subordinates' \nmotivation to engage in creative tasks b y setting expectations for creative performance (Koseoglu et \nal., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018; A. Lee et al., 2020), there is a growing interest in exploring the impact \nof transformational leadership on creativity and innovation (Chaubey et al., 2019). By in tegrating all \nof those factors together we proposed a conceptual framework and examined how \ntransformational leadership, employee creativity, and organizational innovation were related. In \naddition, we tested if intrinsic motivation of employees moderates the relationships.  \nThis study is important because numerous organizations across various sectors currently and \ncontinually are experimenting various methods to inspire their employees to work creatively and \ndevelop new and exciting ideas (Gu et al., 2015). We examined how le adership factor affects \npromoting employee creativity which is said to be a fundamental element for achieving innovation \nin organization. (Shalley & Zhou, 2008). This study opens the black box from a new insight by \nshowing the configurations of creativity and further advances in the research on human resource \nflexibility and employee creativity performance.  \n \nFindings of Study  \nFrom the study conducted in small and medium -sized companies with 419 samples in South Korea, \nwe acquired the following findings.  \nFirstly, transformational leadership exhibited a positive correlation with organizational innovation. \nResults of the study suggested that the more a leader demonstrates transformational leadership \nqualities, the more effectively it stimulates organizationa l innovation."

This study utilized the conceptual \nframeworks of emotions in organizations (e.g. dialogic, constructivis t, functionalist, and critical) \nproposed by previous studies to explore the learning emotion of SME employees. The study was \nconducted through in -depth interviews with 21 employees from nine SMEs.

A Systematic Review  \nCho Hyun Park  & Sunyoung Park  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nPaper’s Importance and Theoretical Base  \nHybrid work is a combination of technology -supported virtual (off -site) and in -person (on -site) work \ninteractions (Chong et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2017). Since the COVID pandemic in 2020 when alternative \nwork forms dramatically spread, scholars have paid c onsiderable attention to the important role of \nhybrid work for employees and organizations. Recognizing its significance for talent retention and \nattraction, organizations have increasingly adopted hybrid work models (Tsipursky, 2023). \nChoudhury et al. (20 22) reported that, despite managing a higher volume of emails, hybrid workers \nreceive better performance ratings from managers than their in -office counterparts. Allen et al. \n(2024) identified critical employee behaviors for hybrid work settings such as ad apting to change, \nfocusing on tasks over prolonged periods, managing the time and schedule for deliverables, and \nperforming efficiently and autonomously. In a hybrid workplace, employees collaborate while \nworking in different work modes. However, the dynam ics differ between a hybrid setting and face -\nto-face or fully remote setting where all employees work in the same work mode (Fiol & O'Connor, \n2005). As organizations explore various hybrid work formats, the concept continues to evolve, \nnecessitating a comp rehensive understanding of the meaning and ongoing evolution for effective \nimplementation. Thus, there is a need to understand what hybrid work means for organizations and \nhow the concept of hybrid work is evolving to implement it effectively. This study d raws on the task -\ntechnology fit model (Goodhue & Thompson, 1995) and the job demands -resources model (Bakker \n& Demerouti, 2007) as the theoretical framework to discuss the evolution of hybrid work.   \n   \nResearch Purpose and Significance  \nThis study aims to integrate existing knowledge of hybrid work and identify future research needs \nby reviewing prior research. This study is significant for HRD to (a) clarify the hybrid work concept, \nand (b) present a conceptual framework for researchers and practitioners navigating the evolution \nand implementation of hybrid work.   \n   \nResearch Questions  \n1. What are the characteristics and profiles of current hybrid work research?   \n2. How have previous studies defined hybrid work?   \n3. What are the prominent themes, patterns, and trends in hybrid work research?   \n   \nMethodology  \nThis research reviews hybrid work literature in SSCI - and Scopus -indexed journals. Using the Web of \nScience Core Collections and Scopus database, we found 564,032 articles with hybrid work -related \nkeywords. After excluding irrelevant articles, 187 remained , which we will analyze to uncover \nresearch trends, definitions, main themes, and propose a future research agenda.  \n   \nImplications for HRD Practice  \nAfter gaining a clear understanding of the hybrid work concept, HRD needs to establish and \nimplement effective policies tailored to each organization. These hybrid work policies will help \nattract and retain talented employees while maximizing employee perf ormance.    \n     \nConclusions  \nThis study will contribute significantly to the ongoing development and implementation of effective \nhybrid work practices tailored to diverse organizational settings. It will help organizations attract \nand retain a talented workforce."

In the  current \nlandscape, where digital tools and technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big \ndata analytics are becoming integral to business operations (Jafari -Sadeghi et al., 2021), their impact \non HRD practices, strategies, and outco mes is both profound and largely unexplored.  \nThe significance of our research lies in its capacity to bridge the knowledge gap in how these \ntechnological advancements are not just altering, but also enhancing HRD functions such as talent \nacquisition, employee training and development, performance man agement, and employee \nengagement (Yorks et al., 2022). With the workforce becoming increasingly digital, remote, and \ndiverse, understanding the role of these technologies in facilitating effective HRD strategies is \nessential for organizations to remain com petitive and adaptive (Hanelt et al., 2021). Moreover, our \nstudy delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by these advancements, providing \ninsights into how organizations can leverage technology to foster a more dynamic, skilled, and \nresponsi ve workforce (Thite, 2022).  \n \nThe findings from this research are expected to guide HR professionals and business leaders in \nmaking informed decisions about integrating technology into HRD practices, ensuring alignment \nwith the needs and expectations of the modern workplace. In essence , our paper seeks to offer a \ncomprehensive overview of the current state of technological integration in HRD and its future \ntrajectory. By doing so, it contributes to a more nuanced understanding and strategic application of \ntechnology in human resource pr actices, an endeavor that is not only timely but imperative in the \ndigital age.  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nThis paper is dedicated to exploring the influence of technological advancements on Human \nResource Development (HRD). Our specific objectives are:  \n1. To review empirical studies focusing on the integration of emerging technologies within \nHRD.  \n2. To conduct a thematic analysis to identify key themes and trends in the application of \ntechnology in HRD practices.  \n3. To identify research gaps and propose directions for future research and practical \napplications in HRD.  \n \nResearch Methods  \nTo accomplish our outlined objectives, we employed a scoping literature review. This methodology \nis particularly suited for our study as it allows us to (a) extensively explore the range and nature of \nresearch activity concerning technological advancements  in HRD, (b) assess the need for a more \ndetailed systematic review in the future, (c) efficiently summarize and disseminate key research \nfindings, and (d) identify any significant gaps in the current literature (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005).

First, we will search several \nacademic databases, including Academic Search Ultimate, Business Source Ultimate, ScienceDirect, \nJSTOR, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the ProQuest Business Collection, using keywords such \nas 'technology in HRD', 'digital transformation', and 'human resource development technology'. We \nestablished criteria for inclusion: peer -reviewed articles, published in English, from 2019 onwards.  \nNext, we will review article abstracts, excluding those not focused on technological advancements in \nHRD. In the final stage, we will apply an additional criterion: the inclusion of empirical studies or \nsubstantial theoretical contributions in the field.  \n \nImplications for HRD Practice  \nThe findings have significant implications for HRD professionals implementing technological \nadvancements. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of strategically integrating \nemerging technologies into HRD practices, aligning with workforce needs an d organizational \nobjectives. Key insights emphasize the necessity for HRD professionals to adopt a forward -thinking \napproach in embracing technological innovations, ensuring tech adoption fits the organization's \nculture and caters to diverse workforce need s (Leal -Rodríguez et al., 2023). This approach ensures \nthat technology adoption in HRD is not just a trend but a transformative tool for personal and \norganizational growth.  \n \nFurthermore, our research underscores the critical role of fostering a technology -centric culture \nwithin organizations as fundamental for modern HRD. This culture should promote continuous \nlearning, innovation, and adaptability, enabling employees to effec tively leverage the potential of \ntechnological tools in their career development (Wallin et al., 2022). By embedding such a culture, \ntechnology becomes an integral part of the organizational ecosystem, leading to a more dynamic, \nefficient, and future -ready  workforce (Lee & Roh, 2023). The outcomes of our review provide \nstrategic insights for HRD and organizational development professionals, emphasizing the need for \na balanced integration of technology in HR practices that benefits both employees and the \norganization (Yorks et al., 2022). This strategic integration is essential for developing a workforce \nthat is not only technologically proficient but also agile and responsive to the rapidly changing \nbusiness landscape.  \n \nConclusion  \nOur extensive review illuminates the complex and transformative role of technological \nadvancements in the realm of HRD. The study highlights the potential for revolutionizing HRD \npractices, offering innovative solutions for workforce training, talent management, and employee \nengagement (Yorks et al., 2022). However, our analys is also reveals challenges, such as aligning tech \ninitiatives with organizational strategies and addressing concerns related to digital literacy and the \ndigital divide in the workforce (Lythreatis et al., 2022).  \nIn conclusion, the paper emphasizes strategic technology integration, recognizing immense benefits \nwhile also considering limitations and challenges. We advocate for a balanced approach that \nleverages the strengths of technological innovations while remain ing cognizant of potential pitfalls \n(Lee & Roh, 2023). Moreover, our research identifies a critical need for further empirical studies on \nthe long -term effects of technological interventions in HRD, particularly in varied global contexts \n(Jafari -Sadeghi et  al., 2021; Thite, 2022). Such research is essential to deepen our understanding of \neffective technology utilization for current HRD needs and to prepare for future challenges and \nopportunities in the ever -evolving workplace.  \n \nKeywords:  technological advancements, digital HRD, human resource development"

The focus \nhas shifted from administrative processes and intra -organizational management to citizen service \nand inter -organizational management (Osborne, 2010; Osbor ne et al., 2013). Governments are \nincreasingly focused on serving citizens and meeting their expectations, changing the way they \noperate in order to improve transparency, democratization and the provision of public services \nthrough eGovernment, as citizens  are increasingly digitally empowered and demanding in terms of \nthe way, speed and efficiency in which these services are provided (Mergel et al., 2019).  \nIn Portugal, however, despite the high level of availability of digital public services, citizen uptake is \nbelow the European average (European Commission, 2022). This leads us to a question: what could \nbe the reasons behind this gap?  \n \nThe aim of this work is to provide a preliminary insight into the evolution of the digitalization policy \nof the Public Administration in Portugal over the last two decades and to raise possible research \nhypotheses on the question presented, based on theore tical principles of the new paradigms of \npublic management such as the New Public Service and the New Public Governance (Denhardt & \nDenhardt, 2007; Osborne, 2010).  \n \nFirst of all, a brief contextualization of the topic and a summary of this evolution are presented. This \nis followed by an analysis of the eGovernment digitalization/penetration paradox in Portugal, where \nstatistical data is presented and analysed to help us understand the problem presented. Finally, the \nresults of the analysis are discussed, with brief concluding remarks.  \nThis work is part of a research project being carried out as part of a doctoral thesis, the aim of \nwhich is to understand why there is such a contrast between the high level of availability of public \nservices online and their low use by citizens in Portugal (European Commission,  2022).

Numerous technological tools such as \nmobile applications, messaging services, and remote online therapy platforms fill the growing \ndemand for mental health services (Martin, 2015) and unmet care needs across health and social \nservices in the UK and beyo nd (Dowling, 2021), despite concerns about technological determinism \nof such an approach (e.g., Fleming, 2019). There is a growing consensus around the limitations of \ntechnology in automating or digitalising jobs demanding ‘social and emotional capabilitie s’ (Manyika \net al., 2017, p. 35) or ‘human touch’ (Karakilic, 2022, p. 185). Furthermore, affective labour’s \nresistance to technology has gendered implications for the future of work because broadly \nconceived care jobs are predominantly performed by women whose labour is often underpaid and \nundervalued (Fotaki, 2023). There is a danger that the change in mental health services delivery \nthrough online platforms as market commodities (could make the jobs of the people delivering \nthem more precarious (Cotton, 2021). Yet, none of these limitations have been investigated in - \ndepth from a human resource perspective, nor are the implications appreciated comprehensively \nby offering gender analysis of affective labour (Ozdemir Kaya and Fotaki, 2023a), as we do in thi s \nresearch.  \n \nThe paper uncovers the embodied, sensorial, psychosocial, and spatial elements of affective labour \nthat resist technological replacement or replication, mapping their implications for mental health \nservice delivery. We will study these in the setting of ps ychodynamic psychotherapy where \ntechnology -mediated online therapy provided via remote platforms poses peculiar challenges, \nraising questions of safety, efficacy, and equity of access (see Craciun, 2019; Johnson et al., 2022; \nPunzi and Singer, 2018). Speci fically, we will examine how technology enables and restrains job \nperformance, impacts reach and affordability, pay and conditions, and occupational segregation \nfrom a gender perspective, contributing to the emerging future of work research (Howcroft and \nRubery, 2019).  \n \nReferences  \n \nCotton, E.

      "text": "299 \nID:131  - Navigating the Digital Wave: A Scoping Review of Technology's Impact \non Employee Engagement in the Post -Pandemic Landscape (2021 -2023)  \nDiane Keeble -Ramsay  & Obinna Ejiogu  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThe COVID -19 pandemic ushered in transformative changes across business functions and sectors. \nThe impact on Human Resource Development (HRD) was profound.  It was the catalyst to a rapid \nshift towards technology -driven practices. Remote work became the no rm.  AI -powered tools \nemerged as valuable training allies and digital learning platforms seemed to blossom into vibrant \nknowledge hubs (Onana & Kassah, 2023).   Bansal et al (2023) conceptualized providing a potentially \nunified understanding of that HR Dig ital Transformation (HRDT).  Given the potential for \nincorporation of HR digitilisation, smart -/green -/sustantainable and e -HRD, it determines HRDT as \nthe process of using digital technologies to innovate and improve HR practices and outcomes.  From \nwhich it might be proposed that HRDT offers advantages of flexibility and scalability.  It also \nintroduces challenges. Amidst this transformation of the landscape towards the post -pandemic era \nthen, a critical question arose to query whether this influenced Empl oyee Engagement?   \nEngaged employees are not merely committed to their tasks; potentially they are emotionally \ninvested in their organization's success.  This translates into tangible benefits potentially like \nincreased output and improved service quality. Therefore, Employe e Engagement has been \nconsidered a current critical factor within organizational success. Maintaining pre -pandemic levels \nof Employee Engagement, potentially offered by traditional HRD practices, might then be a concern.  \nIt is suggested that traditional H RD strategies often rely on face -to-face interactions —such as in -\nperson training and team -building exercises (even where technology is employed through electronic \ninteractions).  Thus, may foster a sense of belonging and purpose amongst participants.   Suc h a \nsense of belonging from physical interactions may be a psychological trigger towards greater \nEmployee Engagement (Kumar & Pansari, 2016).  Whereas, Digital platforms possibly lack the social \nrichness and immediacy of physical human interactions.  That might lead towards feelings of \nisolation or disconnection among employees.  \n  \nThis paper reports a scoping review investigating publications within the post pandemic period of \n2021 to 2023.  It seeks to explore reports of any relationship between technology infused HRD \npractices relative to Employee Engagement or motivation, commitm ent, and overall well -being.  \nFrom which review progresses a timely synthesis of the evolving landscape of technology driven \nHRD and Employee Engagement.   It seeks to build upon prior knowledge to gain insights from \nHRDT’s emerging technologies, by the pr esentation a current map of trends, strategic \nconsiderations and challenges.   By illuminating these areas, a potential to empower HRD \nleadership more effectively might be advocated.    Being able to potentially anticipate future shifts, \nmight facilitate m ore effective harnessing of such technology to cultivate further Employee \nEngagement given a rapidly changing work environment.  \n \nReferences  \n \nArksey, H & O’Malley, L.

Currently, generative AI (GenAI) has been one of the fast -growing AI \ntechnologies that has garnered the attention of businesses an d government organizations. \nBusiness and AI leaders have predicted that AI will impact many jobs by altering how work is \naccomplished and processed. An Accenture published study projected that AI would affect 40% of \nthe working hours through augmentation a nd automation (Accenture, 2023). The ability to \nsuccessfully repurpose these 40% of working hours to other productive and creative activities is \nwhat faces the future leaders of businesses and organizations. With the effective utilization of AI \ntechnology and purposeful relocation of these 40% working hours, leaders could propel \norganizations to another level.  \n  \nTo take advantage of what AI has to offer, McGlaufin and Abrams (2023) recommended four actions \nleaders and human resource professionals must take to advance their organizations in this time of \nrapid change. First, evaluate and determine the relevant AI to ols and how and when to implement \nthem in the work process. Second, determine AI competencies and KSAs needed for the \norganization and attract the right AI talents. Third, educate, prepare, and develop the rest of the \nworkforce to be AI -ready. Fourth, prep are the organization for forthcoming regulations. \nUndoubtedly, future leaders are faced with the challenges of managing these crucial actions \neffectively to adopt AI technology and ensure successful organizational change. This research will \ninvestigate the se challenges and propose a competence -based approach toward developing AI -\nsavvy leaders to lead vital AI -driven organizational change.  \n  \nBorrowing from HRD/HRM, psychology, cognitive science, and organization behavior literature, we \naim to set a guiding framework for developing AI -savviness leaders over and above their current \nleadership and management responsibilities. As we approach this research, the following are \nessential considerations. First, adopting AI as a technology will likely experience the technology \nadoption cycle only at a very rapid speed. Second, AI adoption will likely differ from previous \ntechnology innovations because of  its ability to perform cognitive functions, often considered \nunique human capabilities. Third, the generative nature of AI will likely change the dynamic of the \nleader -follower relationship since it will likely project influence on attitudes, feelings, th inking, \nbehavior, and performance of the individual, groups, and organizations in unpredictable ways that \nleaders may or may not be aware (Tigre et al., 2023). Fourth, AI will likely impact the organization \nhierarchy by altering the path of communication, information sharing, and decision -making. Fifth, AI \nadoption will likely alter the organization's culture, which may require the continuous development \nand application of AI tools and digital knowledge and the creation of growth spaces for sharing and \nlearning (Schiuma et al., 2022).   \n  \nA leadership competencies perspective will guide our inquiry. Competence is often defined as \nknowledge, skills, personal characteristics, self -concepts, traits, and motives (McClelland, 1973). \nAbbu et al. (2022), brought forth the definition of digital lea dership to include digital literacy and \nethical AI. Philip et al. (2023) proposed six essential competencies for managing digital \ntransformation: visionary thinking, agility, understanding the value of data, data -driven decision -\nmaking, knowledge of strate gy, and acceptance of change. Zivkovic (2022) proposed nine \ncompetencies: vision, innovation, flexibility, understanding digital technologies, empowerment, \ncollaboration, multiple intelligences, experimentation, and continuous learning."

Firstly, this study will contribute to helping \nmanagers to understand employee perceptions of EW. It wil l also contribute to the body of \nknowledge and literature on EW and expand and enrich the interpretation of pre -existing EW \ntheories.  \n \nAim and Purpose  \nThe aim of this research study is to investigate employee perceptions of EW and help managers to \nunderstand EW Ulster University and Queens University.  \nThe purpose of this research is to investigate and propose strategies for improving the \nunderstanding of managers regarding their employees' perceptions of wellbeing within HE in NI. \nThis research will focus on how HR professionals can best develop manager s to enhance their \nawareness and comprehension of how employees perceive and experience wellbeing in their \nrespective institutions.  \n \nTheoretical foundations  \nEmployee perceptions of EW in the HE sector are integral to the development of EW initiatives \n(Tham & Holland, 2018). The employee voice plays a significant role in the development of EW \ninterventions which can lead to increased productivity, operational e xcellence, creating cooperative \nworkplaces and enhancing the student learning experience (Boxall & Purcell, 2016; Pyman et al., \n2010).  \n \nEmployees face several wellbeing challenges in educational institutions which have affected \nemployee engagement, performance, job motivation and productivity resulting in a dip in employee \nresilience (Abbas & Zhiqiang, 2020; Bently et al., 2014). Several a uthors have argued that if \nappropriate wellness interventions and successful health & wellbeing strategies are not \nimplemented by managers, the TE sector will be faced with unmanageable workloads, burnout and \ncreative thinking will diminish (Bao et al., 20 20; Tham & Holland, 2018).  \n \nEmployees perceive non -financial benefits such as working from home, flexible working hours and \nwork life balance to be important factors in maintaining emotional wellbeing. However, with \nincreased uncertainty around job security, employment longevity and financial benefits are highly \nsought after by employees. Managers need to enhance their communication channels around \nmental, physical, and emotional wellbeing support programmes including household composition, \npurchasing habits, and financial education, which should be tailored towards individual employee \nneeds (Hinkle, 2020; Tham & Holland, 2018). Managers must ensure that they have a wide range of \nbespoke resources to offer employees, such as telehealth, stress management and resilience \nprograms which c ontributes to increased productivity resulting in a happier, healthier workforce \n(Hinkle, 2020)."

Despite the paucity of literature, limited \nscholarship has noted how technological advances li ke AI might and can impact various dimensions \nof HRD. A portion of the scholarship has focused on broader aspects of AI related to HRD (e.g., \nAkdere et al., 2022; Ekuma, 2023) and noting its destructive and creative force (Su et al., 2020). \nScholars have a lso discussed various concepts that are generally of HRD interest, like coaching \n(Graßmann and Schermuly, 2021), training and development (Ali et al., 2023), learning and \ndevelopment (Bhatt and Muduli, 2021), expertise development (Ardichvili, 2022), perso nalized \nlearning (Li and Wong, 2023) along with a few studies on designing and conducting HRD -AI research \n(e.g., Kambur and Akar, 2021). Further, a few HRD scholars have also narrowly focused on \nspecialized concepts in AI, like people analytics (e.g., Lee and Lee, 2023; Yoon et al., 2023).  \nA cursory review of the HRD -AI scholarship makes it clear that HRD scholars, especially those with \nteaching responsibilities, have yet to explore questions like how AI can impact their teaching, how AI \ncould be incorporated into their teaching, what challe nges might be faced in incorporating AI in \ntheir teaching, etc. In a way, this is not surprising given that historically, only limited HRD \nscholarship has focused on teaching HRD (Bhattarai, 2023). However, scholars in other educational \nfields have started  discussing how different forms of AI can possibly impact how they teach. Some \nrecent examples are teaching science (Cooper, 2023) and mathematics education (Hwang and Tu, \n2021).  Scholars have noted that incorporating newer technologies in the classroom c an change an \ninstructor’s professional identity (Howear, 2023).  \n \nIn this context, a narrative study is being designed to explore how incorporating innovative \ntechnological advances like AI in HRD classrooms influences an HRD instructor’s professional \nidentity. We are interested in how generative AI, such as ChatGPT, cou ld disrupt, extend, and \ntransform the subjectivity of HRD instructors. Generative AI is a technology that produces human -\nlike content using a machine -learning model based on a large amount of publicly available digital \ndata (Baidoo -Anu & Ansah, 2023). Chat GPT, a generative AI tool regarded as affordable and easy to \nuse, is gaining popularity in various fields, including education. While Ausat et al. (2023) concluded \nthat ChatGPT can only be a tool and not a replacement for teachers in the classroom, the \neme rgence of generative AI provides a unique context to explore what it means to teach when \nlearners have access to an evolving learning aid that can provide customized support.  \nUsing the lens of socio -technical theory, we aim to interview HRD instructors who mobilize \ngenerative AI as a pedagogical tool to examine how generative AI interacts with their sense of \nprofessional identity. The study's findings will provide a better unde rstanding of how HRD \ninstructors use generative AI, how they navigate issues relating to AI in their pedagogical practices, \nand its impact on their professional identity.  \n \nKeywords:  Professional Identity, HRD Instructors, Generative AI"

      "text": "306 \nID:204  - Artificial intelligence and its impact on the work of civil servants : A \nsystematic review  \nJosé Dias Lopes, Paulo Almeida Gonçalves, Ricardo Raimundo  & João \nRodrigues dos Santos  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThere is a strong belief that Artificial Intelligence has the potential to impact the field of public \nadministration for many years to come (Shark, 2019). This conviction has materialized in several \nrecent initiatives that seek to analyze this development.  The United Nations regularly assesses the \nglobal situation of e -government, and its E -GOVERNMENT SURVEY report has only looked at the \nimpacts of artificial intelligence on public administration since 2018 (the report is published \nbiannually in UN reports 2018; 2020; 2022), which attests to the actuality of the subject.  \nOne of the areas where this impact will be felt most is in human resources (Neumann, Guirguis & \nSteiner, 2022). This situation, which is transversal to most sectors of activity (see WEF, 2023, p6; \nOECD, 2023), will necessarily affect the public administrat ion and is therefore already cause for \nconcern on the part of its employees (Misuraca & van Noordt, 2020). The topic has also been the \nsubject of a research effort in academia, reflected in a growing number of publications. It is this \nbody of work that thi s research systematically analyses.  \n \nThe adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Public Administration also has the potential to increase the \nquality of the work carried out by Human Resources in the public sector. AI can optimize \nrecruitment, selection, and talent management processes, making  it possible to analyze CVs and \nskills more efficiently. Then, intelligent systems can be decisive in identifying training needs and \npromoting the continuous development of employees. By automating routine tasks, HR \nprofessionals will be able to focus on m ore strategic activities, promoting a more efficient \norganizational environment adapted to the constantly evolving demands of public administration.  \nIn addition, AI will also have an impact on the cybersecurity of training and digital professions at the \npublic level. Greater attention should be paid to the use of AI in cybersecurity in the validation of \nqualifications and competencies (e.g. recognition of diplomas). In other words, the ever -increasing \ncomplexity of the academic and professional environment will increasingly require AI -based \nsupport systems for decision -making that allow HR m anagers to adapt more quickly and access the \nright digital workforce, not least because electronic public services (e.g. e -health, e -learning, and e -\nelderly) are set to increase exponentially (Floridi et al. 2021).  \n \nThe use of AI will introduce a rapid devaluation of many of today's skills and, consequently, a \nsignificant disruption to the labor market and the very nature of employment, with inherent \nconsequences for the overall management of human resources in the Public Administration. Thus, \nprom oting the development of AI in support of new skills, while anticipating and mitigating its \nimpact on current ones, will require careful management and some intergenerational solidarity \nbetween those disadvantaged today and those favored tomorrow, to ensur e that the disruptive \ntransition between the present and the future is as fair as possible for everyone.  \n \nThis research uses a systematic literature review, procedurally supported by the PRISMA Protocol \n(Liberati et al. 2009; Moher et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021) for the selection and extraction of articles. \nBy combining the search keys \"Public administration \", \"Artificial Intelligence\", \"e -government\", \n\"human resources\" and \"Jobs\". The search resulted in a set of 100 documents published in journals, \nwhich constituted the research collection."

According to Jiang et al. (2017), \n\"The underlying ‘backbone’ technology that supports AI is machine learning, in which algorithms can \nlearn from existing data sets, identify patterns,  and make decisions without being explicitly \nprogrammed to do so\" (p. 231). AI is used commercially from hiring decisions to loan application \nscreening, from sentencing guidelines for judges to law enforcement’s facial recognition systems \nand beyond (Mehra bi et al., 2021). As these AI systems learn from human -generated data, they can \nalso learn and perpetuate social biases, and not surprisingly –they have (Aizenberg et al., 2023). As \nZajko (2021) noted “In the literature on data science, ML, and AI, the imp licit general definition of \nbias (in AI) is any tendency, pattern, or association that is problematic” (p. 2).  \n \nSocial bias is “discrimination for or against a person or group or a set of ideas or beliefs in a way \nthat is prejudicial or unfair and behaving in a way that disadvantages a person or group or \nadvantages another” (Webster et al., 2022, p. 131). Social bia s in AI is more than just an engineering \nor technical problem; it requires extending our view into the more extensive social system in which \nit operates (Dolata et al., 2021). Hence, “social -technical approaches in AI are an emerging area that \nrequires a b road set of disciplines” (National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST], 2022, p. \n3) to understand the interactions between people, technology, organizations and the development \nof AI systems. Given the potential roles played by leaders and human r esource development \nprofessionals in guiding the development of inclusive and bias -free AI systems, the purpose of this \nliterature review working paper informed by ethical leadership (Brown et a., 2005) and social \nlearning theories (Banduare, 1977) is to u nderstand the relationships between the social systems \nand the design of AI systems and the factors influencing the design of inclusive and bias -free AI \nproducts.  \n \nReferences  \n \nBandura, A.

Organizational innovation is derived from the innovative behaviors of \nindividuals within the organization. Promoting individual innovative work behaviors through \neffective leadership becomes crucial. Therefore, this study focuses on digital leadership, a new \nleadership style essentially needed the  digital transformation era. Moreover, actual behavioral \nchanges in individuals are influenced not only by environmental factors such as leadership but also \nby individual characteristics like individual’s psychology or attitudes. Thus, the aim of this stud y is to \nanalyze the influence of digital leadership on innovative work behaviors by considering the \nmediating roles of individual psychological capital and job crafting in this relationship between the \ndigital leadership and innovative work behaviors.  \n \nTo achieve the research purpose, data were collected from 250 employees working in large South \nKorean companies using a survey. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling \nwith SPSS 29.0 and AMOS 29.0 package programs.  \n \nThe findings of this study are as follows. First, employees’ perceptions of their supervisors’ digital \nleadership significantly influence their innovative work behaviors. Second, the sequential mediating \nroles of psychological capital and job crafting were  found in this relationship. Thus, this study \ncontributed to revealing structural relationships among digital leadership, psychological capital, job \ncrafting, and innovative work behaviors. Based on the results of this study, academic and practical \nimplica tions in HRD were presented by expanding the understanding in existing leadership research \nand offering managerial strategies for organizations.  \n \nKeywords:  Digital transformation, Digital leadership, Organizational innovation, Innovative work \nbehavior, Psychological capital, Job crafting"

The global pandemic has stressed the nee d for businesses to \nincorporate technology into their business models to enable human connection, belonging, and \ncreativity in the modern workplace (Dean & Campbell, 2020). Covid -19 stressed the essential role of \nlearning and development, as professionals were tasked to facilitate a seemingly overnight \ntransition to remote work and use innovative learning practices to produce and sustain a wholly \ndigital learning environment (Hughes, 2021).  \n \nLearning and Development (L&D) is considered a key function of many organizations and is now \n“almost exclusively online” (Pugh et al., 2018; Govender & Adegbite, 2022). The Association for \nTalent Development (ATD) defines L&D as “a function within an organ ization that is responsible for \nempowering employees’ growth and developing their knowledge, skills, and capabilities to drive \nbetter business performance” (What Is Learning and Development?, 2023, par #1). Separated from a \ntraditional working space, and f rom supervisors and office peers, continuous learning, effective \ncommunication, and maintaining collaboration are crucial for L&D professionals’ career success in \nvirtual work environments (Yarberry & Sims, 2021).  \n \nAccording to Govender and Adegbite (2022), the technological advancements of the 21st century \nmandates a high level of learning agility to improve how L&D professionals learn in the workplace. \nThese professionals must develop extensive social capital, inte rnal and external to their \norganization, and competence in digital technologies. They need to know how technology works, \nhave the discernment to select appropriate and adaptable technology to meet the needs of the \nworkforce, and understand technology devel opment (Hughes, 2021).   \n \nFor many, working remotely has blurred boundaries between one’s personal and professional \nenvironments. These obscured lines have increased opportunities for some to engage in informal \nworkplace learning through reflection, feedback, and fulfilling one’s o wn ideas, while for others, has \nserved as an additional stressor that could diminish learning performance and one’s motivation to \nlearn (Muhlenbrock et al., 2023). Nonetheless, technology not only enables informal learning, but \nalso massively extends the m eans available to learn on one’s own (Watkins et al., 2018).  \nGiven the significance and known benefits of effective L&D and society’s expanding reliance on \ndigital technologies, there is a dearth of research on how L&D professionals, who work remotely, \nlearn in preparation to facilitate the learning of others. Infor med by informal learning, \ntransformational learning, and generative learning theories, the purpose of this literature review \nworking paper is to understand 1) how professionals learn when working remotely due to the \nCOVID -19 pandemic; 2) what are the facto rs influencing their learning; and 3) how their learning \nexperiences impact their professional identity. The paper will conclude with implications for human \nand organizational development (HRD) professionals working remotely while facilitating others’ \nlearning and development in this digital era.  \n \nReferences  \nDean, B.

As Generation Z (born 1995 – 2010) is known \nas the first truly digital native generation, they rely more heavily on digital learning than previous \ngenerations in higher education settings (Eckleberry -Hunt et al., 2018; Shore y et al., 2021). The \nrecent global COVID -19 pandemic has also had a large influence on their medical school learning \nexperiences (Gallagher et al., 2022).  \n \nAs medical students graduate from medical schools in the United States of America, they prepare \nfor the next step in their journey to becoming a physician. This transition is marked by the students \nbecoming Graduate Medical Education (GME) Trainees, also k nown as Interns or Residents in \nAmerican medical education (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). The chosen specializations \nwithin medicine, such as Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Dermatology, Surgery, lead these trainees to \ntheir specialized training p rogram or Residency (ACGME Institutional Requirements, 2022; \nFairbrother, 2023). These residency training programs can range from three to five years or more, \ndepending on the specialty of training (ACGME Specialties, n.d.). These years are vital to the \neducation and training of new physicians. They learn, not only the foundational knowledge of their \nchosen specialty, but also gain the clinical experience and familiarity necessary to interact with \npatients and navigate the American medical system. This type  of learning is rooted in progressive \ninteraction with superiors, peers, and patients in the clinical setting (Ryan et al., 2022). Active \nlearning of this type is situated in the experiences of the GME Residents as they participate in the \nclinical communit y they want to become a part of (Lave & Wenger, 1991). And because GME training \ntakes place in a real world clinical setting, it is impacted by current and historical events (Silkens et \nal., 2023). Thus, the years spent in Residency are vital to the matura tion of autonomously \nfunctioning physicians, ready to practice independently (Ryan et al., 2022).  \n \nWhile national accrediting bodies outline the basic requirements for GME training completion, \nindividual programs are left to interpret the execution of training to meet these requirements. \nInformed by the Situated Learning Theory (Lave & Wenger, 1991), th e purpose of this literature \nreview working paper is to understand the approaches to learning (e.g., digital learning) of \nGeneration Z medical residents and the facilitation of learning of this digital native generation \nduring their GME training. The paper  will conclude with implications for learning and human \nresource development professionals working in the medical field in our digital age.    \n \nReferences  \n \nACGME Institutional Requirements.

Consequently, it is important to understand the roles and competencies \nrequired of Curator due to the changed virtual environment.  \nThis study aims to analyze the roles and competencies required of museum professionals in the \nchanged digital exhibition environment. To explore this, the Behavioral Event Interview (BEI) \nmethod was employed. This approach targeted curator with over three years of practical \nexperience in digital exhibitions. The interview framework, grounded in the STAR (Situation, Task, \nAction, Result) methodology, provided a comprehensive view of real -life scenarios, responsibilities, \nactions taken, and outcomes.  \n \nThe findings reveal that curator must extend their repertoire beyond traditional roles and \ncompetencies. This research found that the curator should develop competencies in exhibition -\nrelated techniques, proficiency in humanities and social sciences, an un derstanding of new media \nand technologies, skills in exhibition communication and public relations, and the capacity to \nrespond to global environmental changes. Based on the results, this study suggests HRD \nimplications in research and practice, limitation s, and suggestions for future research.  \n \nThis study contributes significantly to understanding the evolving roles of curator in a digital \nexhibition context, offering valuable perspectives for further research and practical applications in \nrelated fields.  \n \nKeywords:  curator, roles, competencies, digital exhibition environment"

      "text": "316 \nID:230  - AI and the Changing Nature of Work: Implications for HRD  \nMengying Cao  & Maria Cseh  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) consists of systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, \nsuch as understanding language, recognizing voices, learning, and solving problems. AI \nadvancements have allowed machines to exhibit human -like intelligen ce and adaptability (Russell & \nNorvig, 2021). Over the past few years, the rapid growth and adoption of AI technology has had a \nprofound impact on a number of fields, such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing. In \norder to understand how and  why AI is being implemented in the workplace, and its impact on \nmanagement, working conditions and skills needs, the OECD conducted a survey study (Lane et al., \n2023) with 5,334 employees and 2,053 companies in the manufacturing and financial sectors in \nAustria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. \nThe findings of the study show that AI is changing significantly the nature of work. AI in the \nworkplace boosts productivity and enhances quality, but also leads  to job displacement and skills \nmismatches, necessitating reskilling (Bukartaite & Hooper, 2023; Cazzaniga et al., 2024). Everett \nRogers' Diffusion of Innovations Theory provides insights into how technological changes are \nadopted within an organization (G arcía‐Avilés, 2020) and highlight the importance of developing \nHRD practices that are not only responsive to technological advancements but also aligned with the \nlearners' needs and organizational goals.  \n \nThe literature indicates that reskilling in an AI -driven economy is a continuous learning process \n(Pradhan & Saxena, 2023). The literature also shows the critical role of strategic thinking in \nfacilitating AI integration within organizations, highlighting the need for workforce learning and \ndevelopment programs in both technical and soft skills to effectively harness AI's potential \n(Morandini et al.,  2023). These programs are increasingly focusing on not only imparting technical \nknow -how of AI systems but also fostering adaptability, problem -solving, and ethical understanding, \nessential for navigating the nuanced challenges presented by AI in the workplace. Considering \nhuman -AI collaboration, there are diverse attitudes towards AI ranging from viewing AI as  a \nsupportive tool to skepticism about its functionality (Einola & Khoreva, 2023). HRD professionals are \ncalled to design interventions to create learning opportunities to offset the negative impacts of AI \nand highlighting the need for organizational and e ducational strategies to develop expertise in AI -\nintegrated workplaces (Ardichvili, 2022; Einola & Khoreva, 2023).  \n \n Uncertainties remain regarding the long -term effects of AI on employment trends, specific future \nskill requirements, and effective learning approaches. The need for future studies emphasizes \nunderstanding AI's broader societal impacts, ethical considerati ons, and strategies for integrating AI \ninto workplaces effectively. Thus, the purpose of this conceptual paper based on a systematic \nliterature review is to discuss the relationship between AI and the changing nature of work taking in \nconsideration the abo ve mentioned elements, and the implication for HRD in organization.  \n \nReferences  \n \nArdichvili, A.

Historically, the baby -boomer generation has made up a large portion of both the \nU.S. population and labor force participation. With a large number of that generation now at \nretirement age, projections show the younger generations taking up a larger percentage of the \nlabor force in coming years, making un derstanding their employment needs and expectations vital \nfor the health of the U.S. economy.   \n \nShaped by social norms, organizational culture, and past experiences, a psychological contract, is an \nindividual's subjective belief system about the reciprocal obligations that exist between themselves \nand their employer (Rousseau, 1989). The purpose of t his conceptual working paper is to explore a \nshift in U.S. workers’ psychological contracts, from previous generations who had traditionally \ncommuted to a work -site to Millennial and Gen Z employees, digital natives, who have increasingly \nengaged in digita l spaces, even prior to the mass shift to remote and hybrid work caused by the \npandemic (Ferrazzi, 2023).  \n \nDrawing on existing research and literature, the aim of this paper is to compare the more \ntraditional, in -person psychological contracts of previous generations with the emerging contracts \nof remote and hybrid Millennial and Gen Z workers, born between 198 1 and 1996, and between \n1997 and 2012, respectively (Dimock, 2019). Mezirow’s (1978) transformative learning theory is used \nto interpret increasing global digitization and the COVID -19 pandemic as disorienting dilemmas that \nhave triggered perspective trans formations for many U.S. employees and resulted in a noticeable \nshift in their unwritten mutual expectations between themselves and their employers (Ferrazzi, \n2023). The paper will present how these shifts challenge traditional Human Resource Development \n(HRD) learning and development approaches, as well as management practices, with a focus on \nfactors such as autonomy, trust, communication, career development, and work -life integration.  \nThe paper concludes with a discussion on how organizations should adapt to meet the diverse \nneeds and expectations of Millennial and Gen Z employees in a digital future through fostering \nflexible learning ecosystems, prioritizing personalized development o pportunities, and cultivating \nmanagerial competencies built on trust, effective communication, and outcome -based performance \nmanagement. By understanding and adapting to these evolving psychological contracts, \npractitioners can play a crucial role in attra cting, retaining, and developing a thriving Millennial/Gen \nZ workforce in the digital age.  \n \nReferences  \n \nDimock, M.

AI, with its \nimmense potential, brings about transformative changes acro ss industries, revolutionizing \nprocesses, decision -making, and human interactions. However, its rapid advancement raises ethical \nconcerns, including biases in algorithms, potential job displacement, data privacy infringements, \nand the overarching impact on  society. Leaders must ensure that AI systems are developed and \nused in a manner aligned with ethical principles, considering their societal and workplace \nimplications. This includes addressing biases in AI algorithms, ensuring fairness and transparency, \nand safeguarding against unintended consequences. Further, AI should serve humanity and not \novershadow human values or compromise workplace safety and employee wellbeing. Responsible \nleaders should be able to prioritize the human element, ensuring that AI a ugments human \ncapabilities while preserving dignity, empathy, and the human touch in decision -making processes. \nOrganizations that prioritize ethical AI practices are likely to gain the trust of stakeholders, foster \ninnovation, mitigate risks, and sustaina bly navigate the complexities of the AI -driven world. Thus, \nresponsible leadership in the age of AI requires a delicate balance between technological \nadvancement and ethical considerations.

This \nmultidimensional analysis embraces several key aspects, such as diversity management, leadership \nand inclusion, as well as the a doption of an inclusive organizational culture (Barak, 2000). The aim is \nto develop innovative and effective strategies for training leaders adapted to contemporary \nchallenges and requirements.  \n \nWith this in mind, the study focuses on how inclusive leadership principles can be effectively \nintegrated and implemented in HRD strategies. It examines the processes and approaches by which \norganizations can transform their policies and practices to promo te a working environment that \nwelcomes and values diversity in all its forms. This involves a thorough review of internal policies, \ntraining programs for managers and employees, and the implementation of practices aimed at \ncultivating an organizational cul ture that actively recognizes and celebrates diversity. The aim is to \nhighlight the crucial importance of creating a working environment where talent diversity is not \nsimply recognized, but actively encouraged and valued, thereby making a significant contr ibution to \norganizational innovation and growth. This requires a profound transformation of management \npractices and skills development strategies within HR departments.  \n \nThe analysis also extends to the impact of inclusive leadership on organizational performance, team \ndynamics and project management. It is crucial to assess how inclusive leaders can encourage \ninnovation, creativity and productivity by harnessing the wealt h of diverse perspectives, experiences \nand skills present within their teams. The study highlights the importance of leaders developing an \nempathetic and flexible approach, fostering a spirit of collaboration and mutual respect.  \nThe role of Human Resources Development (HRD) in establishing and promoting such leadership is \nof paramount importance (Torraco & Lundgren, 2019). This involves designing training and \ndevelopment programs that not only raise awareness of the benefits of di versity and inclusion, but \nalso instill practical skills for integrating these values into day -to-day management.  \n \nThe paper also looks at how integrating inclusive leadership into HRD strategies transforms the \ninternal dynamics of organizations. This involves changing internal policies to foster a more open \nand collaborative environment. More inclusive and interactive  workspaces are created, encouraging \nthe exchange of ideas and strengthening team cohesion. Similarly, transparent and respectful \ncommunication is promoted, which is essential to building a working atmosphere where diversity is \nnot only accepted, but also seen as an indispensable asset for organizational prosperity and \ninnovation. These changes require a holistic and well -structured approach, involving all levels of the \norganization. Leaders need to set an example by adopting inclusive behaviors, while comp any \npolicies and practices need to be reviewed to ensure that inclusion is integrated into all aspects of \norganizational functioning. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment processes, performance \nappraisals, professional development initiatives and career progression opportunities. These \ntransformations within HR departments and organizations as a whole are crucial to establishing a \nworking climate where diversity is embraced as a key component of success and innovation."

Adopting this \napproach is seen as a major catalyst for employee engagement, fosteri ng a workplace where every \nvoice is heard and valued (Kuknor & Bhattacharya, 2020). This integration of diverse perspectives \nnot only strengthens collaboration between employees; it also significantly improves organizational \nperformance by fostering a bett er understanding and appreciation of diverse experiences and skills. \nIn the context of the digital age, characterized by unique challenges and opportunities, the inclusive \napproach is becoming increasingly important (Gabor & Brooks, 2017). Digital technolo gies, by \ntransforming modes of communication and interaction, offer new ways of effectively integrating \nand managing diversity within companies (Bouncken, Kraus, & Roig -Tierno, 2019). Not only do these \ntechnologies facilitate remote collaboration and inter cultural communication, but they also make it \npossible to develop training and professional development strategies tailored to the needs of \ndiversity and inclusion (Garro -Abarca, Palos -Sánchez, & Aguayo -Camacho, 2021). The study \nexamines the theoretical fo undations of inclusive leadership, drawing on key theories and relevant \nresearch to develop a conceptual model. These include Jean Piaget's theory of social \ntransformation, which highlights the importance of adaptation and integration in the learning and \ndevelopment process, and Daniel Goleman's theory of emotional intelligence, which emphasizes \nthe importance of self -awareness and empathy in leadership. Other theoretical references include \nGreenleaf's work on servant leadership, highlighting the importance  of serving others in a \nleadership position, and Crenshaw's research on intersectionality, which sheds light on how various \nidentities intersect and interact in the professional context. These theoretical approaches provide a \nsolid foundation for the devel opment of a conceptual model of inclusive leadership. This framework \nis designed to ensure the rigor and relevance of the approach, offering an analytical tool for \nunderstanding and applying inclusive leadership in a variety of organizational contexts. The  model \naims to establish links between the theoretical principles of inclusive leadership and their practical \napplications in the real world, taking into account the contemporary realities of work environments.  \nIn the face of rapidly changing demographics and increasingly complex global business \nenvironments, the importance of adopting comprehensive and innovative strategies for inclusive \nleadership development is highlighted. This paper proposes an innovative co nceptual framework \nfor integrating the principles of equity and inclusion into leadership development programs. This \nframework highlights the growing importance of digital technology in facilitating and strengthening \ninclusive leadership initiatives, offer ing new opportunities for tomorrow's leaders to engage with \ntheir teams in more meaningful and effective ways.  \n \nBuilding on a solid theoretical foundation, this study explores various theories and previous \nresearch that shed light on the inclusive leadership approach. Building on a solid theoretical \nfoundation, this study explores various theories and previous resea rch that inform the inclusive \nleadership approach. Among these foundations are important contributions from social \ntransformation theory, emotional intelligence, servant leadership, and concepts of intersectionality, \nwhich together form a robust framework for our understanding of inclusive leadership. The detailed \nanalysis of existing literature, coupled with the development of a conceptual model, ensures not \nonly the academic rigor of the research, but also its practical applicability. Implications for res earch \ninclude the opportunity to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which inclusive \nleadership can be cultivated and implemented in diverse organizational environments. This opens \nthe way for future studies that could explore the relationship be tween inclusive leadership and \nvariables such as organizational performance, innovation, and employee well -being. On the \npractical side, the implications are vast.

These \ndisruptions are also threatening careers’ sustainability and requiring ag ile actions capable of \nrestoring hope and faith in the future while increasing employees' and institutional resilience.  \nIn fact, COVID -19 has shaken individuals, teams, institutions, and societies generating major and \nunparalleled career shocks. The latter has been described as “disruptive and extraordinary events \nthat are, at least to some degree, caused by factors outside  the individual's control and that trigger \na deliberate thought process concerning one's career. The occurrence of a career shock can vary in \nterms of predictability and can be either positively or negatively valenced” (Akkermans, Seibert, and \nMol, 2018, p .5). COVID -19 jeopardized work and careers in many ways:  \nFirst, it led to widespread job losses, resignations, and economic instability. The International Labor \nOrganization (ILO) estimates that the pandemic has resulted in the loss of 255 million full -time jobs \nglobally in 2020 alone, with millions more workers  facing reduced hours and income (ILO, 2021). \nThis substantial deterioration of the global labor market exacerbated the financial stress of \nvulnerable households, increased inequities and negatively impacted individuals’ general well -being. \nThe ILO’s last projections suggest that a return to pre -pandemic performance remains elusive (ILO, \n2022).  \n \nSecond, it caused an unprecedented “people impact” complicating the work of both individuals and \nteams (Collings et al., 2021, p.821). The shift toward remote work or hybrid work models to comply \nwith social distancing measures has created a \"new normal\" i n which individuals and organizations \nmust adapt to novel ways of working. While this has allowed some workers to maintain their jobs \nduring the pandemic, it has also created challenges related to work -life balance, access to \nresources, and social isolatio n (Owl Labs, 2021) as not all employees experience telework positively \n(Cañibano & Avgoustaki, 2022).  \n \nThird, the levels of stress and burnout among employees skyrocketed. A survey by the American \nPsychological Association (APA) found that 78% of employed adults reported experiencing at least \none symptom of stress, such as feeling overwhelmed or anxious, du ring the pandemic (APA, 2021). \nA study on a sample of 102 academics showed that 20% experienced high and prolonged levels of \nanxiety because of blurred work -life boundaries (Hughes & Donnelly, 2022). Another survey by \nMonster (2021) found that 69% of respo ndents reported experiencing burnout symptoms, such as \nexhaustion or decreased productivity. Those working in essential services and healthcare suffered \nmore due to overwork and the sensitive nature of their work as first responders. According to a \nsurvey conducted by FlexJobs (2021), 42% of adults reported undesired weight changes due to \nstress. In addition, a global study by Gloster and colleagues (2020) examined the impact of the \npandemic on mental health across 78 different countries using a sample of 9 ,565 individuals. The \nstudy found that on average, 10% of the sample reported low levels of mental health, while \napproximately 50% reported moderate levels. Some studies pointed to the fear of COVID -19 as a \nmain cause of mental health decline (Simsir et al ., 2022) while others emphasized the intolerance of \nuncertainty (Elsharkawy and Abdelaziz, 2021) and a lack of quality of life due to social isolation \n(Szczepanska and Pietrzyka, 2021). This unprecedented state of burnout and low psychological well -\nbeing h ad dramatic effects on performance, job satisfaction, and employee retention (Akgunduz et \nal., 2021)."

This \nconference working paper explores the emerging findings fro m an ongoing PhD study which aims \nto explore interpretive insights (Cunliffe 2019, 2022) in terms of practical theories of the lived \nexperience of the developing leader and how leadership is learned from relational ‘moments of \nsurprise’ with others.    \n \nAdopting a hermeneutic phenomenological perspective, it is hoped new insights or ways of thinking \nmay emerge about what we know as leadership and what is involved in the developmental process \nof becoming a leader. In this sense, the study seeks to contribu te to the ‘critical turn’ for leadership \nresearch by developing insights that will ‘tell us something about the subjective, the personal and \nthe interpersonal, about ideas and beliefs, about how people talk and dream about leadership’ \n(Ford, 2019, p.277); contributing to the theoretical understanding of an aspect of leadership \nresearch which has received less focus - the personal development of leaders over time \n(McDermott, Kidney and Flood, 2011).  \n \nTheoretical base  \nThe study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge that advocates the importance of tacit, social \nand situated learning (Kempster and Stewart, 2010; Stead 2013). It is theoretically located from the \nperspective that leadership is a ’highly variable, rel ational and contextual phenomenon that people \nconstruct differently depending on who they are and how they interact with the world’ (Carroll, \n2019, p.128).  \n \nIt is increasingly recognised that leadership development involves felt/embodied experiences \n(Carroll and Smolovic Jones, 2018). Indeed felt experiences can be both key triggers for, and \nelements to support, meaning -making/learning from our experiences. Nu merous academics have \nexplored the developmental power of such felt moments/events/conversations such as ‘moments \nof momentum’ (Sutherland 2013) and the various works of Cunliffe – ‘arresting moments’ (Cunliffe, \n2001), ‘moments of being struck’ (Cunliffe 2 002) and ‘poetic moments’ (Cunliffe 2018a). The latter \ndrawing on the French philosopher, Ricoeur (1991), and their ideas on the rapturous effects of \ninstants.  \n \nAdopting an alternative phrase, this study explores the developmental impact of ‘moments of \nsurprise’ arising from relational moments with others. Leaders identify such moments as spaces or \ntimes when they were called to stop and evaluate their lives in a significant way and encouraged \npersonal consideration ‘of different possible ways in which we might relate ourselves to our \nunderstanding’ (Shotter, 2008, p.108).  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThe overarching aim is to explore the developmental influence of ‘moments of surprise’ on leaders. \nThe paper will explore emerging findings drawn from in -depth qualitative interviews with ten \nleaders."

This \nstudy uses available digital technology to highlight this paradox through surveys.  \nThe study will focus on peoples’ reaction to bad leadership and why it persists in every sector.  \nBad leadership practices and behaviors are detrimental, ineffective, harmful to individuals, society, \nand organisations at large. Bad leadership has been known to cause poor economic indices such as \npoverty, poor health care delivery, insecurity and agitat ion which leads to civil unrest. It leaves \ndetrimental consequences to nations which may suffer the effects in years. For organisations, it \nleads to low employee morale, decreased productivity, and organisational dysfunction and high \nemployee turnover. In severe cases, it could lead to the death of economically viable \ncompanies/organisations.  \n \nTheoretical base  \nTheoretical frameworks from leadership studies will shed light on nuanced relations shaping \nleadership. Five types of bad leadership theories will be explored. To gain knowledge on bad \nleadership, a qualitative survey is used which served the most appropriate methodology within a \nphenomenological research paradigm, using semi structured questionnaires. This is combined with \nsome quantitative descriptive statistical analysis using factors derived from the initial review of \nliterature conducted.  \n \nLiterature on leadership, characteristics and behaviour of bad leaders, followers/individuals will be \nconsidered. Using data from a semi structure questionnaire sent to 83 individuals from different \nworks of life, accountability and responsibility in leade rship is investigated. The analysis confirms \nthat bad leadership comes from the same people who experienced it firsthand. Our leaders are us. \nWe are our leaders.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThis paper explores followers/individuals’ reactions to bad leadership practices and its \nconsequences - poor and ineffective leadership. It takes a reflective and historical perspective based \non individuals’ feelings.  \n \nResearch questions  \n• Why do bad leaders prevail?  \n• What factors influence bad leadership?  \n• How are bad leaders perceived by people?  \n• What can be done to prevent bad leadership in the society?  \n \nThe abstract highlights the interconnectedness of paradox and bad leadership and the contextual \nnature of leadership ineffectiveness.  \nFactors such as non -accountability, incompetence, integrity is explored to understand their roles in \nperpetuating negative leadership outcomes.  \n \nThis paper will argue that the perceived bad leadership practices and behaviour affect followers. \nYet, when in leadership positions we fail to change the way bad leaders lead.

To this end, managers and \nother workers in the central state administration answere d a questionnaire about their perception \nof public policies, making suggestions for improving and building public policies.  \nThe sample consisted of 442 participants, workers from the Portuguese Public Administration. Of \nthese participants, 122 hold managerial positions, and 320 do not hold managerial positions.  \nRegarding recruitment, the participants who hold managerial positions value competence and \nexperience first and foremost. Transparency, impartiality, and speed in tenders were the second \nmost mentioned aspects; here, respondents gave examples of how to put  this idea into practice by \nhaving tenders carried out by specific entities in a position to do so or by allocating human \nresources prepared for the purpose. The responses from participants who do not hold managerial \npositions focused on the transparency, impartiality, and speed of competition. The most mentioned \ncharacteristics were valuing competence and experience, valuing remuneration, and fighting \ncorruption. Several respondents pointed out that this last aspect could be combated by not allowing \nfamily  members or workers with other connections to be hired.  \n \nAbout training, both the participants in management positions and those not in management \npositions listed training in specific areas appropriate to the position. However, what differentiates \nthem are the areas each mentions as specific to the position. Participants in management positions \nconsidered the following to be important: so ft skills, conflict management, human resources \nmanagement, project management, accounting, finance, law, public procurement, focus groups, \nhygiene, safety and health at work, SIADAP (performance management and evaluation system), \nethics and sustainability . Next, the most mentioned characteristics were making training \ncompulsory, carrying out employee surveys to define training, increasing the range of training on \noffer, training enabling career progression and establishing protocols with external bodies. T he \nparticipants who do not hold managerial positions considered the following areas: law, public \npolicy, English, IT, sustainability, human resources, public service, motivation, emotional intelligence, \nmental health, or public procurement. Next, the two m ost essential aspects mentioned were the \nemployee survey to define training and the increase in the training offer.  \n \nFinally, concerning evaluation, the participants who hold management positions mentioned the \n360º evaluation. Next, the most mentioned aspects were the revision of SIADAP (faster career \nprogression and annual evaluation) and the creation of indicators for meeting objectives. Those \nwho do not hold management positions mentioned the abolition/revision of quotas. In this sense, it \nwas often said that quotas should only exist for achieving excellence. Next, the most mentioned \naspects were the revision of SIADAP  (such as faster career progression, annual evaluation, \nsimplification of the process, objectives to be met being defined according to the organic unit in \nwhich the workers are located), the fight against corruption/increased transparency in the process \nand 360º evaluation.  \n \nIn this study, several suggestions were made for areas where we consider it essential to reformulate \nor develop new public policies.

To remain relevant, companies need to be alert, permanently identifying and addressing \npotential threats and opportunities. Continu ous transformation plays a determinant role for \ncompanies who strive and are successful. However, more than just solutions’ definition or decision -\nmaking processes, it is of the utmost importance to understand how companies identify, analyze, \nprioritize an d overcome these challenges. Due to its nature, strategic problems often entail a much \nhigher risk than recurrent or at least known problems, thus becoming critical to analyze how \nbusiness managers approach such problems.  \n \nFor that matter, building on prior research of complex problem solving, the key research objective \nof this study is to attempt to identify what factors influence business managers’ approach selection, \nwhen facing a strategic problem, and how do they adapt their behavior depending on the \ncomplexity, uncertainty and urgency of the problem.  \n \nThis objective arose from a holistic analysis of ten prior research issues and seeks to better \nunderstand and further develop the existing knowledge about the following questions: How do \ncompanies set the agenda of problem solving? To what extent do compan ies adopt scientific \nproblem solving processes? Which factors have a greater impact towards the application of a \nsystematic approach? Can unfamiliarity affect the type of capabilities selected to solve problems? \nDoes the outlook of the situation affect the  problem solver judgment? What reasons influence the \nproblem solving governance framework? To what extent do problem solvers promote a \ncollaborative and interactive process? What kind of mechanisms do companies use to solve \nconflicts? Which kind of stakeho lder management model do companies use? To what extent do \ncompanies adopt a joint problem solving process?  \n \nTo enable a comprehensive view of the subject, the study is structured as follows. A first chapter \nproviding a broad perspective of the existing problem solving literature, breaking it down into an \noverview of the process, the main phases towards problem r esolution and the types of capabilities, \ncognitive styles, stakeholders’ management and approaches used within problem solving. \nSubsequently, a second chapter with the description of the research methodology, the main issues, \nresearch questions and objecti ves that led to this study and the research instrument used to gather \nthe necessary empirical evidence.

Klaus \nSchwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, introduced the  concept of the \"Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution\" (4IR), describing it as a fusion of the physical and digital worlds, integrating \ntechnologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and \nrobotics (Schwab, 2017). The se advancements are revolutionizing sectors including manufacturing, \nhealthcare, transportation, and agriculture by enhancing automation, efficiency, and \npersonalization.  \n \nThe WEF (2018) predicts that 'human' attributes such as creativity, critical thinking, persuasion, and \nnegotiation will grow in importance alongside 'technological' skills like programming, analytical \nthinking, and continuous learning. Additionally, there will be an elevated demand for skills in \nleadership, relationship management, emotional intelligence, and social influence (WEF, 2018). Gray \n(2016) emphasizes the impact of 4IR on the skill sets required by the forthcoming generation of \nemployees.  \n \nThis paper conducts a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to examine the influence \nof 4IR on the anticipated skills of future employees, specifically the human skills, and their relevance \nto the employability of graduates. This is crucial for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to reassess \ntheir existing curricula. The literature reveals various terms used interchangeably with soft skills, \nincluding critical cross -field outcomes, people skills, and interpersonal skills. These will be \ncollectiv ely referred to as 'soft skills' in this paper.  \nThe integration of soft skills into Higher Education (HE) curricula is identified as a crucial yet \nfrequently overlooked element, especially within the context of the South African job market. This \npaper highlights the critical importance of soft skills in  augmenting abilities and bolstering \nemployability in South Africa. Using Constructivism, this study explores the relationship between \nsoft skills and employability in the context of the 4IR in South African labor markets, emphasizing \nthe necessity for tal ent management methods that promote both technical and interpersonal \ncompetencies.  \n \nTheoretical Base  \nAmineh & Asl (2015) articulate that Constructivism theory, championed by renowned thinkers such \nas Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, and Perkins, evolved as a response to the inadequacies of conventional \neducational methodologies.  \nAt its core, constructivism posits that individuals actively construct knowledge by building on their \npre-existing understanding. This theory emphasizes the proactive role individuals undertake in \nknowledge formation and asserts that learning is a continua l, dynamic endeavor (Birenbaum, 2003; \nWoolfolk, 1993).  \n \nResearch Purpose  \nThe purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic review of literature to understand how HEIs \ncan better integrate soft skills into their curricula to meet the demands of the 4IR, thus improving"

By exploring strategies \nfor talent development, the goal is to empower SMTs in secondary scho ols, ultimately enhancing \ntheir ability to achieve successful and effective service delivery.  \nImportance: This study holds paramount significance in offering essential insights and guidance to \nSchool Management Team (SMT) members. Its central focus on nurturing the talents and \ncapabilities of SMT members through the exploration of effective talent development strategies is \ncrucial. The ultimate objective is to empower SMTs within secondary schools, thereby significantly \nelevating their proficiency in achieving successful and effective service delivery. Through a \ncomprehensive examination of talent c atalysts, this research seeks to contribute to the overarching \ngoal of enhancing educational leadership and organizational effectiveness in secondary school \nsettings.  \n \nTheoretical base:  The contingency approach to management, or contingency theories, are complex \nand have broad implications (Ahmed et al. 2020).  Current research and future possibilities indicate \nthat the relationship management paradigm has great promise for incorporating  the contingency \ntheory into that of School Management Teams (SMT). With an emphasis on developing SMT \nmembers' skills and capacities, this study is committed to providing insightful analysis and helpful \nsuggestions. The goal is to empower SMTs in secondar y schools by investigating talent development \ninitiatives, which will ultimately increase their ability to provide successful and efficient services.  \nResearch purpose: The study used a qualitative research technique with an exploratory research \ndesign with a structured interview questionnaire to determine if SMTs had certain competences, \nknowledge, or attributes that increase their abilities and to prov ide recommendations for enhanced \nservice delivery. The research enlisted the help of n = 12 participants from four different secondary \nschools to get first -hand experience of the phenomena under inquiry. Participants were specifically \npicked for their expe rtise, knowledge, and talents. Data were collected from participants via \ninterviews, and the data were evaluated using content analysis. Atlas -ti (Version 8.2) was used to \nevaluate data collected from participants. The researcher used a qualitative researc h approach, \nnamely a phenomenological strategy based on constructivism. With no data modification, this \ntechnique was adopted to understand the viewpoints of the SMT inside the selected schools.  \nMain research question: What impact does talent catalysts and the development of an exceptional \nSMT have on achieving optimal service delivery in secondary schools?  \n \nImplications for practi ce \nThe challenges that recently appointed teachers must overcome have a substantial impact on their \nability to advance professionally, especially in the first five years of their careers. Modern \neducational approaches, such those described by Makhananesa & Se peng (2022), highlight the \nsignificance of talent recognition and development in light of this era's vulnerability. For modern \nschools to succeed, systems for recognizing and developing the unique abilities of each School \nManagement Team (SMT) member must be put in place. This includes projects like skill -building \nworkshops, mentorship programs, and opportunities for individualized professional development.  \nFor SMTs to collaborate effectively and foster team cohesion, communication must be effective. \nFoste ring transparent and honest lines of communication is crucial, in line with research showing \nthat teacher cooperation and SMT members' activities are positively correlated (Lu & Hallinger,"

In order to maximize the team's combined skills, it is imperative that SMT \nmembers cultivate a collaborative culture that offers chances for cooperative problem -solving, \nknowledge exchange, and cooperative decision -making.  Ensuring comprehensive understanding of \nschool legislation and regulations is imperative. Continuous updates and training sessions should \nbe provided to keep SMTs informed about changes in the educational landscape. Research \nemphasizes the role of effective adminis trators in supporting efficient teaching and learning, \ncontributing to school improvement (Sun & Leithwood, 2017; Benoliel, 2021).  Investing in the \nleadership potential of SMTs is vital. Training and resources should be provided to enhance skills \nsuch as decision -making, strategic planning, and vision -setting. Recognizing the significance of \nvarious individuals in leadership, not solely principals, is emphasized by scholars (Harris & Jones, \n2017; Leithwood, 2016; Malloy & Leithwood, 2017; Benoliel, 2021).

It is crucial to as sist SMTs in keeping abreast of the most recent advancements in \ncurriculum design and instructional techniques. Promoting the use of cutting -edge teaching \ntechniques raises the standard of education as a whole.  Fostering a culture of adaptability within \nthe SMT recognizes the need for flexibility in the ever -changing sector of education, enabling the \nteam to welcome changes and modify tactics as needed.  It is imperative to acknowledge the \ncultural variety present in today's educational workforce, which is  shaped by factors such as \nglobalization, migration patterns, and labor law modifications (Sibanda & Majola, 2023).  It is crucial \nto foster a positive and enthusiastic work environment within SMT. Acknowledging and appreciating \nsuccesses encourages team m embers' enthusiasm and determination (Mangu'uu, 2022).  \nConclusion: The study emphasizes how crucial it is to provide specialized mentoring and training \nprograms for talented School Management Teams (SMTs). Considering the broad spectrum of \nduties that SMTs perform, such as purchasing, updating infrastructure, coordinating with the \ncommunity, and managing communications, it is critical to acknowledge the close relationship that \nexists between their positions and the delivery of accessible learning assistance in schools.  The \nstudy pinpoints a particular set of q ualities and traits that are essential for SMT performance, \nincluding emotional intelligence, management smart, interpersonal skills, effective communication, \nand team -building proficiency. It is believed that these attributes are necessary for SMTs to car ry \nout their duties and make an essential contribution to better service delivery.  \n \nKeywords:  catalysts, exceptional, optimal, School Management Team, service delivery, talent"

      "text": "339 \nID:97  -Navigating Chaos: The Impact of Place Leadership on Volunteer Success \nin Crisis Response  \nSusie Walsh  & Alan Johnston  \n \nAbstract   \n \nPurpose  \nCovid -19 has provided a catalyst for the changing working environment, significantly considering \nthe way in which leaders come to the fore and how followers are encouraged and developed. This \npaper considers the importance of Place Leadership in working wi th community environments \nduring periods of turbulence and instability.  Beer et al (2019) suggest place leadership is founded \non the social and relational connectivity between individuals and groups in a specified environment \nor place. As such it goes bey ond traditional approaches to leadership and is often dependent on the \ncontext of the time (Sotarauta and Beer, 2017).  Furthermore, it is rooted in a non -hierarchical, \ncollaborative structure based on mutual co -operative practices (Sotarauta and Beer, 201 7). \nLough (2021) argues that leadership developed from within communities is more effective than \nleaders trying to work with communities.  This has the benefit of both increasing engagement and \nbuilding resilience from within.  Hamel and Välikangas (2003) iden tify the quest for resilience as an \nopportunity to yield a significant return to an organisation.  The concept of resilience has been \nexplained as the ability to recover or rebound.  Other terms used include springing back, \nbouncebackability and buoyancy.  Fundamentally, it focuses on the ability to return to the original \n(natural) state. Consequently, it is an in -demand quality required for leaders and within \norganisations.  Bhamra et al (2011) suggest that resilience is about the capacity to return to a s table \nstate after a period of disturbance, disruption, or adversity.  \n \nDesign / Methodology / Approach  \nIn this narrative research investigation explores the leadership dynamics of spontaneous volunteer \nactivity during the Covid -19 pandemic. The research followed a case study approach based on a \nsingle group of spontaneous volunteers drawn together in a response to a crisis.  Data was  \ncollected through qualitative means to draw on individual’s interpretations of events and \ncircumstances.  Through the use of semi -structured interviews, the participants shared their \nexperiences and stories, and it is these narratives that are explored to  consider leadership within \nthis community group of volunteers.  \n \nFindings  \nSignificantly, empirical evidence confirms the effectiveness of leadership in achieving successful \noutcomes for the group members, the leader, and the wider community. This effectiveness is \nattributed to factors such as knowledge and understanding of the community, effective leadership \nskills, authentic behaviours, and an adaptable leadership style. It is important to note that, despite \nthese contributing factors, no one styl e of leadership has been identified in this study.  \nThe research has found that spontaneous volunteering, in emerging groups, can be inspired, and \npositively influenced, by a transformative, authentic albeit informal leader (Walsh and Johnston, \n2022).  The findings suggest that when a leader nurtures a 'com munity culture,' demonstrating \nauthenticity and shared values with group members, it proves to be a highly effective leadership \napproach within the scope of this research. Consequently, the research advocates for the \nconsideration of community culture as a  best practice approach in leading spontaneous volunteers \nin response to crisis events."

This research was conducted using a qualitative approach by utilizing semi - structured \ninterviews and analyzing data through the content analysis method with 31 participants of \nGeneration Y from five dif ferent business sectors including (1) Food and Beverages; (2) Food \nProduction; (3) Construction Materials; (4) Commerce and Real Estate; and (5) Energy and Utilities.  \nThe results indicated that 13 factors influence Well -being contributing to the retention of \nGeneration Y talent in the organization , respectively as follows: (1) Healthy Relationships at Work; \n(2) Health and Flexible Benefits; (3) Pay; (4) Work -Life Harmo ny; (5) Strategic Leadership; (6) \nAutonomy; (7) Work Environment; (8) Facilities; (9) Challenging Work; (10) Opportunity for Growth; \n(11) Work Process; (12) Mattering at Work; and (13) Work Location. Findings reveal that the top \nthree factors are: Healthy Relationships at Work (17.32%), Health and Flexible Benefits (16.54%), and \nPay (10.24%) of the total elements that affect Well -being, comprising 44.10% of all factors. In \naddition, there are 11 factors that influence the retention of talented Generation Y in Organization, \nrespectively as follows: (1) Healthy Relationships at Work; (2) Opportunity for Growth; (3) Work -Life \nHarmony; (4) Benefits; (5) Mattering at Work; (6) Learning Opportunity; (7) Pay; (8) Strategic \nLeadership; (9) Corporate Image; (10) Work  Location; and (11) Company Culture. Findings reveal \nthat the top three factors are: Healthy Relationships at Work (18.99%); Opportunity for Growth \n(12.66%), and Work -Life Harmony (12.66%) of the total elements that affect Retention, comprising \n44.31% of a ll factors. It can be concluded from the study results of the two variables that Talent \nGeneration Y is most dependent on Healthy Relationships at Work.  \n \nThe Study will help organizations understand the factors that contribute to employee retention and \nwell-being in the Thai business environment, where Generation Y is playing a significant role in \nreplacing Baby Boomer retirement and Generation X in the wor kforce. These factors will help the \norganization develop a competitive edge and set goals for the future. In order to enable talent \ngeneration Y to remain with the organization, it is necessary to build a solution for managing a well -\nbeing culture that inf luences talent retention. Due to the time periods or variations across the years, \nthe study's conclusions might not fully capture the context or circumstances surrounding labor and \norganizations that existed during that time. Nevertheless, when using resea rch findings, one should \ntake the importance of the business context into account. Furthermore, research on the connection \nbetween Generation Y and other Generations in organization is essential for a comprehensive \nunderstanding. Also, design appropriate g uidelines for fostering harmonious coexistence among \nindividuals in the organization from a holistic perspective.  \n \nKeywords:  Well -being, Retention, Talent Generation Y, Millennials"

In an area with distinct socio -economic \ndynamics and obstacles, it is critical to comprehend how the youth see entrepreneurship and its \npotential as a career route. This study aimed to determine the elements that influence young \npeople's views on entrepreneurship, as well as the obstacles they face and the potential role that \nthey can play in effecting social c hange through entrepreneurship.  \nTheoretical base: For this study, a qualitative research design with interpretivism as its basis was \nutilised. A purposive sampling technique was applied for the selection of a maximum of twenty \nyoung adults to participate in focus group interviews to asce rtain the perceptions of \nentrepreneurship among the youth in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District. Around 47% of North West \n(NW) population is considered poor based on the Lower Bound Poverty Line (Selemela, 2020).  \nThe study explores what motivates young people to pursue entrepreneurship, the obstacles they \nencounter, and how education and societal influences affect their perceptions. This review aims to \nget a comprehensive understanding of how young people view entr epreneurship and its \nimplications for future research and interventions.  \n \nThe conceptual development of entrepreneurship may be established through further explorations \nof the existing theoretical perspectives on entrepreneurship within the different schools of thought \n(i.e., economics, psychology, and sociology). The innovation  theory (also known as the \nSchumpeterian theory) as part of the economic theories of entrepreneurship advanced the \nconceptualisation of entrepreneurship to include innovation and creativity as critical elements to \nentrepreneurship. Schumpeter argued that i n order to create new markets and disrupt current \nones, new ideas, goods, or technology must be introduced. This process is referred to as \nentrepreneurship (Pfarrer & Smith, 2015).  \n \nAccording to Schumpeter, the entrepreneur, as a result of his/her innovative and creative ideas, is \nthe primary catalyst to mobilise and effect economic development by introducing new \ntechnologically advanced processes and products with the intent to trans form, create new and \ndevelop more efficient business processes. Schumpeter postulated that only the extraordinary \ninnovative capabilities of the entrepreneur can present new possibilities that not only challenge but \nalso change traditional economic and soc ial development. Schumpter’s cognitive analysis of \nentrepreneurship further assumes the entrepreneur is responsible for innovation by performing \nthe activities reflected in the below diagram (Mwatsika, Kambewa & Chiwaula, 2018).  \nThe importance of entrepreneurship according to the Department for International Development \nthe process of economic growth in any nation places a high priority on entrepreneurship. While \nindustrialised nations recognise and optimise through the value of e ntrepreneurship, developing \nnations tend to lag behind in leveraging the benefits of entrepreneurship as a crucial component to \nmaintaining consistent growth (Audretsch & Keilbach, 2007). The following points assist in \nformulating an understanding of the s ignificance of entrepreneurship."

Robinson and Taubinsky (2018) contend \nthat resourceful individuals can utilise their physical and cognitive skills to ensure their own \nfinancial stability and well -being..  \nJob creation is established when new businesses create employment opportunities. This directly \naddresses the unemployment socio -economic crisis and related effects according to Fritsch and \nWyrwich (2017). Entrepreneurship actively and positively contribute s towards the reduction of crime \nby providing gainful employment opportunities as an alternative to participating in illegal activities.  \nResearch purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand how youth perceive \nentrepreneurship as a vehicle for future employment and alleviate socioeconomic challenges for \ntheir own context, and whether differences exist in the perceptions of youth from  townships and \nthose from a suburb.  \n \nThe study by nature used a phenomenological strategy followed from the constructivist paradigm. \nThe study therefore asked youth about their perceptions of entrepreneurship as part of their lived \nexperience and how they could develop sustainable livelihoods  out of these ideas.  \nThe fundamental assumption is that by situating individuals in their social environments, it is \npossible to better understand how they view their own behaviour and actions. Frechette, Bitzas, \nAubry, Kilpatrick, and Lavoie -Tremblay (2020) assert that interp retive phenomenology offers a \nspecial approach for examining lived experiences. The basic idea of interpretive phenomenology of \nDasein is that “lived experience, existentialia, and authenticity” are at the core of the consideration \nof such a paradigmatic a pproach within a qualitative research approach (Frechette, et al., 2020). In \nterms of this study, it was expected that the views of youth about entrepreneurship would \ncontextually reveal what entrepreneurship means to them, and how it could be made sustain able in \ntheir context.  \n \nResearch question/s:  \n What do the youth from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District understand about entrepreneurship and \nthe role they are playing in contributing to the economy?  \n What are the perceptions of the youth in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District regarding \nentrepreneurship?  \n \nImplications in practice  \nThe implications of this study on the practice of understanding youth perceptions of \nentrepreneurship in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District are multifaceted. Firstly, the findings offer a \ncritical insight into the factors shaping young people's views on entrep reneurship, unveiling \nmotivators and obstacles that influence their decisions regarding this career path. Understanding \nthese perspectives is pivotal for policymakers, educators, and community leaders as it enables \ntailored interventions and educational in itiatives that resonate with the youth's aspirations and \nchallenges. By acknowledging and addressing these factors, stakeholders can collaboratively work \ntowards fostering an entrepreneurial culture that aligns with the local socio -economic landscape. \nThis highlights the necessity for nuanced approaches and targeted support mechanisms, \nconsidering the varying contexts within the district. Overall, this research underscores the \nsignificance of contextually informed strategies to empower youth in embracing en trepreneurship, \nultimately contributing to economic development and social change within the region.  \n \nConclusion s \nBased on the findings, the following recommendations were made to encourage youth \nentrepreneurship: (1) research databases need to be created to provide a central network that can \nassist in providing information and guidance on entrepreneurship, (2) educat ion and training \ninterventions that will provide the necessary entrepreneurial knowledge and skills development \nopportunities to capacitate the youth towards entrepreneurial choices, (3) creating awareness of \nentrepreneurship in an effort to transform cult ural and social norms associated with negative"

Tasked with this challenge, in addition to an aging workforce \nparticularly i n the western hemisphere (Rudolph & Zacher, 2021) which is affecting older workers on \nthe micro, meso and m acro levels as research shows that a third of the working population \nparticularly in public sector organisations are over 50 and approaching retirement age and this \nparalleled with a declining proportion of younger workers(Bal et al., 2015; Farndale et al. , 2019: \nUnited Nations, 2017) further impacting the demand for talent, the need for sustainable \nemployment has become paramount for firms to manage these uncertainties and maintain their \ncompetitive advantage. The result is a rising paradigm shift from pre vious stereotyping of older \nworkers as easily replaceable by younger workers to innovating talent and business practices \n(Boehm et al., 2021) that attract and retain older workers to remain beyond traditional retirement, \noffering bridge jobs that allow tra nsition into other kinds of work. Arguably, since an organisation’s \nhuman capital is its most important asset for maximising achievement of long -term goals (Barney, \n1991; Becker & Huselid, 2006; Becker & Gerhart,1996), retaining its talent for the long ter m through \nsustained employment would continue yielding results on investments for its continuous high \nperformance (Huselid & Becker, 2011). This perception is further supported by consensus within the \nliterature that older talented workers positively impac t the bottom -line as they are less likely than \nyounger talents to leave their jobs unexpectedly and are highly valued for the knowledge and \nexpertise, experience, professionalism that they bring to their roles (Festing and Schafer, 2014). This \nstudy is dri ven not only by calls to advance understanding of what constitutes a sustainable career \n(De Vos et al., 2020), its core dimensions and dynamics through empirical studies as there is a \ndearth of research in this area but also the need for more research and awareness on TM practices \nwithin public sector organisations as there is still scarcity in this area. In response to these gaps and \nusing sustainable career lens as a theoretical framework for analysing findings, this paper explores \nhow three UK public sec tor organisations innovate their TM programs for sustained employment of \ntheir talented workforce particularly the older workforce amongst others by asking the following  \n \nResearch Questions  \n• How do organisations innovate talent programs for sustainable employment at the meso, \nmicro and macro levels  \n• How do organisations drive implementation of talent programs for successful outcomes \nresulting in sustainable employment of their talents  \n \nTheoretical Framework  \nSustainable careers have been linked to Human Resource policies and defined as “sequences of \ncareer experiences reflected through a variety of patterns of continuity over time thereby crossing \nseveral social spaces characterized by individual agency provid ing meaning to the individual (Van \nder Heijden and De Vos, 2015, p.7). There are three dimensions important for analysis of \nsustainable careers which comprise ‘person’, ‘context’ and ‘time’. The person dimension examines \nthe individual characteristics e.g.  perceptions and agency including choices they make that affect \ntheir work experience. The ‘context’ dimension refers to institutional factors such as the \norganisation and sector where work is situated and the impact on the individual’s experiences"

For the measurements of these dimensions and their outcomes, the \nauthors advocate three indicators which are happiness, health, and pro ductivity as these were seen \nas important factors for an individual’s all -round prosperity. Whilst Happiness indicator \nencompasses the fit between one’s career and their career goals/growth, the health indicator refers \nto the physical -mental capacity fit o f the individual to their career and productivity indicator means \nperformance, high employability and /or potential. These frameworks will be used for discussing the \nfindings from the perspectives of both the organisation and their different talents to und erstand \nthe success or failure of talent programs for sustainable careers of these talents.  \n \nResearch Method  \nThe research adopts a qualitative research method comprising a case study of three public sector \norganisations in the local government, civil service and the other in healthcare using both semi -\nstructured interviews and organisation documents for data coll ection purposes. The data were \ntranscribed and analysed manually, using within and cross -case study analysis methods (Eisenhardt, \n1989).  \n \nSome preliminary Findings:  \nFor all three organisations, talent programs were mainly targeted at attracting employees in the \nhigher job grade bands -band 7 -8 who held managerial roles and who had worked in the \norganisation for over 10 -15 years. One of the interviewees had worked wi th the civil service for over \n30 years and it was in his 30th year he was enrolled on the talent program, showing a very high \nhappiness indicator and sustained career a result.  \nThe interesting finding was that each organization diversified their talent programs in recognition of \nsustainability goals such as reducing inequalities in the workplace which address micro, meso and \nmacro needs as explained below:  \nFor example, the Local Government organisation talent program though exclusive to employees in \nvery senior roles particularly appealed for applicants from under -represented groups and those \nwith disability and intentionally sought for applicants through ro adshows with social networks run \nby these groups.  \n \nLocal government also initiated a program solely for upcoming retirees to allow them to continue \nworking for the organisation to retain tacit talent that can be transferred to younger talents and in \nrecognition of their valued expertise. These are indicato rs of happiness for these talents and \nproductivity for their sustainable careers.  \nOne of the talent programs in the healthcare sector was specifically designed for leadership \ndevelopment of employees who were underemployed due to restricting immigration rules which \nlimited their ability to apply and access work in senior roles that they qualify and so these talents \ncould be retained to meet demands in their talent pool.  \nAll three organisations designed talent programs specifically to attract talents from younger \ngeneration which were successfully running.  \n \nOriginality & Implications  \nResearch shows that Talent attraction and Talent Management ranks as top five priorities for firms \npresently and for years to come and employers of talents must consider innovating practices that \naddress sustainability goals and sustainable careers in orde r to survive the war for talent whilst \ncreating the right organisation culture and environment to retain top talent."

Human resource development (HRD) scholars have been engaged in understanding \nand explaining veterans’ skills transition into civilian work. Veterans’ successful movement in to \ncivilian work is one of the transition outcome indicators of Kintzle and Castro’s Military Transition \nTheory. Grenier and Kehrhan defined expertise and developed the Model of Expertise \nRedevelopment as applied to the broad employment community. Minnis a nd Kirchner’s previous \nwork showed how Grenier and Kehrhan’s Model of Expertise Redevelopment could provide a new \nway to understand veterans’ expertise redevelopment into civilian work as the Model of Expertise \nRedevelopment for Veterans. The purpose of th is conceptual work is to build on this previous work \nconsidering veterans’ transition as it takes place in the liminal space of unbecoming military service \nmembers and becoming civilian employees while engaged in the sensemaking of moving from one \ncultural  world to another, seeking a new identity in civilian life. Understanding their new identity \nand integrating into civilian work can create emotional disruption for veterans necessitating their \nengagement in sensemaking and reculturation. The Model of Exper tise Redevelopment for Veterans \nshould serve as a valuable way for HRD researchers and HRD practitioners to represent and \narticulate the unique experience of military veterans’ expertise redevelopment into civilian work.  \n \nKeywords:  Veterans, Transition, Employment, Expertise, Liminal Space, Sensemaking"

Recent research has \nshown that humility is a key component of effective leadershi p. However, how followers perceive \nhumility is influenced by the leader's gender (Krings et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2018). For instance, \nmale leaders are appreciated and receive more followership while female leaders receive backlash \nand lose followership (Priebe & Van Tongeren, 2023). Moreover, humble female leaders are rated \nlower in their leadership competence (Chiu et al., 2020). As a result, women leaders are impeded \nfrom practicing authentic leadership by being in a double bind, or humility double bin d.  \n \nWhile this issue significantly affects women leader’s performance evaluation, career advancement, \nand leadership development, human resource development has not yet addressed it in research \nand practice. This paper contributes to the body of literature by critically reviewing existing \nliterature and addressing challenges faced by female leaders in relation to humility by situating it in \nthe context of HRD.  \n \nTheoretical base  \n Society's assumptions about gender roles shape leadership perceptions, favoring masculine \ntraits over feminine traits. Women often face challenges of these gender expectations in leadership, \nand deviating from traditional feminine norms can trigger negati ve reactions due to the perceived \nrole incongruity. To untangle the relationship between leadership humility and women leadership, \nwe use the theories of social identity and role incongruity. Social identity theory refers to “attributes \nthat reflect group membership” (Ashforth et al., 2016, p.31). For example, women are expected to \ndisplay communal behaviors such as humility, collaboration, care, and emotional expressivity more \nthan men. When women’s identity interacts with leadership, their behaviors are b ound to the \nperception of role incongruity defined as a “mismatch between beliefs about the attributes typically \npossessed by members of a social group (that is, their stereotype) and beliefs about the attributes \nthat facilitate success in valued social ro les” (Eagly & Diekman, 2008, p. 19). Theoretical framework \nwill help us further explore how leadership humility double bind manifests and affects women \nleadership.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nUsing an integrative literature review, we explore the relationship between humility double bind \nand women's leadership through social identity and role incongruity theories.  \n \nResearch question  \nHow does humility double bind manifest in women’s leadership?  \n \nImplications to HRD  \nThis study emphasizes the importance to question and reassess gender stereotypes and \nconventional leadership norms. We posit that HRD plays a pivotal role in addressing the challenge \nof the humility double bind and fostering an inclusive setting for feminine traits in leadership roles. \nThrough this study, we will offer insights that can inform leadership development programs and \nencourag e them to consider the nuanced impact of the humility double bind on women's \nleadership experiences."

According to SGB (Social Good Brazil), the volume of data \ncreated between 2014 and 2016 alone was greater than the amount produc ed throughout the \nentire history of humanity. Google alone, according to the Google.com portal itself, performs 3.5 \nbillion searches per day. If a single person were to watch all the videos that YouTube serves in 24 \nhours, it would take no less than 2,739, 726 years to accomplish this task, according to YouTube's \nown official upload data. Added to this, there is an unprecedented technological advance, such as \nbig data, the creation of ChatGPT and the evolution of generative artificial intelligence, the growi ng \nconcern with the acronym ESG and the energy transition, essential in risk analysis and investment \ndecisions, putting strong pressure on the business sector. And all this, in a context surrounded by \nthe risks of false information and disinformation.    \n \nAlthough they are not entirely new topics, all these issues that impact society today have a common \nchallenge: dealing with the volume and complexity of information and knowledge. It is an epistemic \nchallenge, as it is about epistemic processes: how knowle dge and information are created or \nacquired, distributed, shared, and evaluated by individuals, communities, and organizations. This, in \nturn, fuels collective decision -making and coordinated action. For Seger et al. (2020), a collective and \nindividual eff ort is necessary to develop practices that ensure epistemic security and the \ndevelopment of organizations and, consequently, of society.  \n \nOf course, not all this is knowledge -driven, but will seeking knowledge in this sea of data and \ninformation be simple or complex? What about the management of this information? And do the \nincreasingly large and intense changes in the scenario in this envir onment have a great or little \nimpact on organizational strategic plans? And how to manage the teams to meet the objectives and \ngoals contained in these plans within this scenario of intense and increasingly frequent changes? \nNonaka and Takeuchi (2021) argu e we need a new type of leaders, what they call “wise leaders”, to \ncope with this new world of major transformations, to allow strategy to become more future -\noriented, society -focused, dynamic, and human -centric.  \n \nFor Nonaka and Takeuchi (2019; 2021), wise leaders are people endowed with phronesis, often \nforgotten type of knowledge that Aristotle talked about 2400 years or so ago. It is interpreted as \nexperiential knowledge that enables us to make prudent judgments in a timely fashion, and to take \nactions guided by values, principles, and morals, better known as practical wisdom among \npractitioners.  It is essential to synthesize this growing complexity of today's social and economic \nforces. Phronesis is the primaril y responsible for the practice of knowledge, not just creation, so \nthey consider it to be the driving force of knowledge flow at the personal, organizational, and \nsocietal levels. They would act as agents of change, making judgments understanding that \never ything is contextual and making decisions considering the changing nature of business and \ncombining micromanagement with the aspirations of the future. These wise leaders can resist the \nshort -term culture and understand how their companies can operate sust ainably.    \n \nFor this reason, research on management wisdom has been gaining increasing interest and \nattention. However, this discussion of wisdom has still been neglected or superficially addressed in \nthe literature on knowledge management (Jakubik; Muursepp, 2022). T herefore, the development of"

However, as observed by Rocha, Kragulj and  Pinheiro (2020), there are still \nopen questions, for example, how leaders and team members seek, absorb, and develop phronesis, \nand its particularities in these processes.  \n \nGrint (2007) reinforces, as stated by Aristotle, that this type of wisdom is not a set of universal rules \neasily learned and reproduced but must be achieved through experience and reflection. Even so, \nthe author adds, experience alone is not enough, especi ally because phronesis is related to \napperception , which consists of the ability to relate new experiences to previous experiences, and \nto develop it, some level of reflective learning is required. Therefore, the author concludes that the \ndevelopment of l eaders needs to be rethought, considering knowledge, skills, and wisdom, not \nnecessarily together, but providing frameworks that can obtain them effectively.  \n In trying to answer these questions, this paper presents some clues and paths on how to lead, \ninvolving and engaging teams within the organizational environment, so that organizational goals \ncan be achieved and even exceeded, even with the intense changes  in scenarios that the current \nworld imposes on us. In this sense, the work in question has the objective to investigate through a \nliterature review, this new type of wise leadership, which exercises practical wisdom, based on \nNonaka and Takeuchi work and,  consequently, is responsible (Eriksen; Cooper, 2018) as well as \npresents an approach using the application of James MacGregor Burns' Transformational \nLeadership techniques combined with Carlos Matus' Situational Strategic Planning and Richard \nWhittington' s abstractions of Strategy as Practice, also including George Kohlrieser's conceptions \npresent in his work called \"Hostage at the Negotiation Table\" and the definitions presented in \nDaniel Goleman's studies on Emotional Intelligence,  in addition to the Fr amework proposed by \nRobson Campos Leite in the work entitled \"Strategy and Leadership in times of profound changes: \nthe path to success in a public organization\".  \n \nFinally, the work aims to contribute to shed some light to the relationship of these different \nleadership development approaches with objective to nurture practical wisdom in individuals in the \norganizational context and consequently supports innovation, s hared value creation, humanized \nstrategies, organizational purpose, adaptation to change, meaningful workplace, and work \nattitudes, such as ethical decision -making,  the creation and sharing of knowledge, the development \nof shared spaces, the well -being of  the worker, curiosity and creativity, involvement, commitment \nand satisfaction at work, thus preparing for the grand challenges we face today.  \n \nKeywords:  phronesis Transformational leadership management"

An acc umulation of these experiences over \ntime is creating a mosaic of their careers. This brings to the forefront the notion of a sustainable \ncareer —one that continues to grow, adapt, and flourish rather than a burst of productivity only to \nfizzle out due to bu rnout. Benefits of a sustainable career go beyond achieving productivity to \nhelping individuals realize their full potential (Lawrence et al., 2015) and offering improved health \nand happiness (Van der Heijden et al., 2020). Sustainable careers offer benefi ts for individuals and \nfor their surrounding context (De Vos et al., 2020).  \n \nVan der Heijden and De Vos (2015) note that sustainable careers are a composite of work \nexperiences intersecting with multiple life domains of work, social, and family across one's lifespan. \nThey provide a definition of sustainable careers as “sequences of  career experiences reflected \nthrough a variety of patterns of continuity over time, thereby crossing several social spaces, \ncharacterized by individual agency, herewith providing meaning to the individual” (p. 7). Sustainable \ncareers include two component s: employability and workability (Lawrence et al., 2015). \nEmployability is the extent to which workers have the opportunity for short -term and long -term \nemployment (Forrier and Sels, 2003) and workability is the extent to which job requirements are \nreasona ble so as not to result in burnout (De Vos & Gielens, 2014, as cited in Lawrence et al., 2015). \nSustainable careers can be developed through a dynamic process of preservation and generation \nwithin a supportive environment that includes a constellation of p ersonal, workgroup, \norganizational, institutional, occupational, and national factors (De Vos et al., 2020). There is a \ndynamic interplay between an individual’s proactive behaviors for growth and development and \nsupport from organizational, occupational a nd societal contexts.  Research on sustainable careers \nthat accounts for experiences gathered over time across multiple work and social contexts is still at \na nascent stage. Career research has focused mostly at the individual level or the organizational \nlevel. Although the individual, organizational, and societal benefits from careers that cross \norganizational and geographical boundaries have been asserted by researchers (Khapova & Arthur, \n2011), there is a gap in the literature of exemplars personal exper iences building sustainable \ncareers examining factors leading to sustainability is still sparse.  \n \nThe purpose of this qualitative research study is to explore how individuals who self -report that \nthey are building sustainable careers describe their actions and decisions in the crafting of their \ncareers, as well as the role of employers, and support sys tems from occupational and societal \ncontexts in supporting such careers.  \n \nTheoretical framework  \n \nSustainable careers include two components: employability and workability (De Vos & De Prins, \n2014; De Vos & Gielens, 2014 as cited in Lawrence et al., 2015). Employability is the extent to which \nworkers have the opportunity for short -term and long -term em ployment (Forrier and Sels, 2003) \nand workability is the extent to which job requirements are reasonable so as not to result in \nburnout (De Vos & Gielens, 2014 as cited in Lawrence et al., 2015).

Contemporary careers of individuals within, outside, and \nacross organizations and occupations as well an emergin g focus that includes the responsibilities \nthat organizations and society has in the ideology of self -actualized careers that “allow individuals to \nrealize their full potential, and access to the social contexts which facilitate that realization” \n(Lawrence  et al., 2015, p. 433) provide a foundation for the development of theories on sustainable \ncareers. Van der Heijden et al. (2020) clarify that the sustainable career complements rather than \nreplaces existing career paradigms, such as protean (Hall, 2002), boundaryless (Arthur & Rousseau, \n1996), and customized careers (Valcour, Bailyn, & Quijada, 2007)” (pp. 1 -2).  \n \nResearch Design  \nThis is an exploratory qualitative study based on a social constructivist worldview (Creswell & \nCreswell, 2022). Participants for this study will be individuals who self -identify as having built \nsustainable careers in spite of challenges such as high stres s jobs or disruptions in personal, \norganizational, or occupational environments that had an impact on their employment. In -depth \ninterviews will be conducted with eight to ten individuals to explore how they describe actions and \ndecisions they took in craf ting of their careers, as well as how employers and support systems from \noccupational and societal contexts may have supported them in building sustainable careers.  \nTaking a reflexive pragmatic approach (Alvesson, 2003) interviews will involve questions that \n“stimulate an interplay between producing interpretations and challenging them” (p. 16). Following \nthe reflexive interview, narratives from participants (Franzosi , 1998) will be carefully interpreted \nthrough narrative analysis (Polkinghorne, 1995; Riessman, 2008) to understand participant \nexperiences and interpretations on the topic within their life and work contexts (de Janasz et al., \n2003; Ferraro, 2021).  \n \nImplications for Human Resource Development  \nWith careers evolving beyond boundaries of a single organization, or even a single occupation, a \nbroader, societal vision for supporting sustainable careers is essential. By understanding factors \nthat support sustainable careers, this study will offer insi ghts for human resource development \nprofessionals for developing effective policies and practices. It will also highlight how professional \nassociations and local communities can contribute to building sustainable careers. Finally, it will \ncontribute to NHR D (McLean, 2004) by considering beneficial strategies at local, state, and national \nlevels.  \n \nReferences  \n \nAlvesson, M. 2003.

First, the \nautoregressive effects of female manager’s leadership competencies and career development \nactivities were significant. Leadership competencies and career development activities were found \nto be stable over time. Second, the cross -lagged effect of leadership competencies and career \ndevelopment activities was significant.

However, the pandemic led to the emergence of virtual \nteams composed of team members and leaders that entered new working practices with no \nestablished shared communication and social relationship building norms f or a virtual work \nenvironment (Lal et al., 2021). The enforced and accelerated nature of this virtual team formation \nled to newly transitioned virtual leaders needing specific skills to manage this adaptive challenge.  \nOur comparative research question is how did the COVID -19 pandemic impact virtual leadership \npractices? A systematic literature review identified the most current and relevant research available \non the dynamics of virtual leadership practices and examined practices required for effective virt ual \nleadership in post -pandemic work environments.  \n \nThe research team proposes the conceptual framework, LEAD, which synthesizes the research and \npromising practices to enhance virtual leadership competencies. The conceptual framework aligns \nthe virtual leadership competencies with the key themes of pandemi c informed effective virtual \nleadership practices, which include 1) Leverage technology, 2) Establish virtual presence, 3) Amplify \nemployee engagement, and 4) Develop trust virtually. Our research is significant because virtual \nleadership is here to stay. Organizations will continue to offer virtual work options to remain \ncompetitive. This framework can be used both at an organizational level and by individual leaders. \nAt the organizational level, the LEAD framework should be used to inform the development of \nvirtual leadership training programs for current and future leaders. At the individual level, leaders \ncan use this framework to assess their practices and make adjustments to more effectively lead \nvirtual teams.  \n \nKeywords:  virtual leadership, leadership and management, virtual team, COVID -19"

In parallel, the increasing costs of data breaches  and number of security \nincidents continue to be a concern to organizations seeking to protect their organization, systems, \nand data. This study’s research questions were formed using a theoretical framework of the Theory \nof Planned Behavior (TPB) to disco ver influences on employee behavior and the Social Bonds \nTheory (SBT) to address strength of relationships and impact to compliance. This study investigated \nin-person and remote employees and their lived experiences with information security policies (ISP) , \nseeking to gain understanding of employee lived experiences, relationships within organizations, \nand ISP compliance.  \n \nThis qualitative study used the phenomenology research method to interview study participants, \nthat worked in -person and remotely, to gather data. Lived experiences of both in -person and \nremote study participants covered their experiences such as with thei r organization’s \nimplementation and enforcement of ISP, organizational culture and leadership attitudes shaping \nISP compliance, and clarity and training of ISP for employee audiences. Top factors that influenced \nemployee compliance of ISPs of both in -perso n and remote study participants included the \nautomation, hectic/busy times, efficiency, availability, training, and enforcement of the ISPs. Overall, \nstudy participants reported positive relationships within their organization, regardless of whether \nthey w ere in -person or remote, however, nearly all study participants also noted that building \nrelationships was easier to do in -person than remote, even as technology has bridged some of the \ngap between in -person and remote working relationships.

Engineering Students’ Perceptions of Workplace \nEnglish  \n \nAkif Çal, Tessa Mearns  & Wilfried Admiraal  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nThis study aims to explore the extent to which engineering students' perceptions of the role of \nEnglish in the workplace are influenced by their internships and fields of study. Previous research \nhas shown that employers highly value English communication skills among engineers, as these \nskills are crucial for employment, daily operations, and career advancement. Additionally, the \nperceptions of workplace communication requirements among practicing engineers are affected by \ntheir engineering disciplines and  their company structures, whether domestic or multinational. In \ncontexts with English -speaking engineers from different linguistic backgrounds, mismatches \nbetween workplace expectations and engineers' English competencies negatively impact their \nemployabi lity.  \n \nTo investigate this topic, this study collected data from 347 engineering students in their third and \nfourth years at a Turkish university. Two independent variables were examined: the engineering \nfield of study and internship experience. The study aimed t o explore whether engineering students \ndeveloped an understanding of workplace communication requirements in English before \ngraduating. Regarding the engineering field of study, the current research assessed whether \nstudents in different engineering discip lines perceived workplace English requirements differently. \nFurthermore, it focused on internship experience to analyze whether exposure to a workplace \nsetting helped engineering students develop perceptions of workplace English requirements similar \nto tho se reported by practicing engineers.  \n \nThe results suggest that neither of the two independent variables resulted in any differences in \nengineering students' perceptions of the role of English in the workplace and its importance for \ntheir future careers. Moreover, it was found that engineering students from different fields of study \nand with or without internship experience reported workplace English requirements differently \nthan practicing engineers did in previous research. These findings  have significant implications for \nhigher education institutions and engineering curricula, highlighting the need to raise awareness \namong engineering students about workplace expectations through curricular reform.

However, given the focus on discovery (research) in \napplied fields (Ghoshal, 2005) such as human resource development (HRD), the scholarship of \nteaching has received lim ited attention (Cho & Zachmeier, 2015). There also is a strong need to \nexpand the bounded scope of HRD research to fill the gap between research and practice through \nincorporating more socially impactful research that contributes to the global agenda of su stainable \ndevelopment (Hoffman, 2021; Howard -Grenville et al., 2019).  \n \nIn this context, the purpose of this study is to examine the current state of the teaching of \nsustainability and the United Nations’ (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) and to suggest \nthe adoption of action learning as an experiential teaching method  in higher education. Our study is \nbased on three research constructs: sustainability management (Annan -Diab & Molinari, 2017; \nJarzabkowski et al., 2021; Stark et al., 2010), the UN’s SDGs (Fauzi et al., 2023; Howard -Grenville et \nal., 2019; Zarestky & Coll ins, 2017), and action learning (Booth et al., 2020; Park et al., 2023) as an \nexperiential teaching method. Two research questions will guide our inquiry: what is the current \nstate of the teaching of sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education? Ho w can action \nlearning be used to teach sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education? To answer these \nresearch questions, we will work through the following three steps:  \n \n• A literature review on sustainability management, the UN’s SDGs, and action learning as an \nexperiential teaching method. As for the review of the literature on action learning, we will \nreview 24 articles, identified in Cho and Egan (2023) related to action  learning for the SDG 4: \nQuality Education  \n• Analysis of the curriculum on sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education. We will \nreview previous studies (e.g., Kurland et al., 2010; Molina et al., 2023) and existing \ncurriculum (e.g., The sustainability degree program in California State Unive rsity, \nNorthridge)  \n• Presentation of an action learning case for its adoption to teach sustainability and the UN’s \nSDGs in higher education and the corresponding suggestions  \n \nHaving less than 10 years left to achieve the UN’s SDGs by 2030, this study will shed light on the \nteaching of sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education and provide insights into the \nimportance of adopting action learning as an experiential teac hing method. The study will show \nhow “to do things differently for creating societal impact” (Hoffman, 2021, p. 515) in research and \nteaching. Furthermore, integration of action learning into the teaching of sustainability will suggest \nfuture leaders’ acti ons of how to play a role for accomplishing sustainable development of the world \nin three sustainability agendas: environmental sustainability (e.g., climate action, affordable and \nclean energy), social sustainability (e.g., poverty, health and well -being,  gender equality), and \neconomic sustainability (e.g., long -term economic growth, corporate responsibility), all of which call \nfor the seamless integration for implementation."

Investigating the intersection of AI technologies and human resource development is \nessential for organizations seeking to harness the full potential of AI to improve workforce \ncapabilities, optimize HR processes, and navigate the challenges and opportuni ties presented by the \nevolving nature of work.  \n \nAI technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way employees acquire and develop skills \nand can help organizations prepare for future workforce dynamics, including the increasing \nintegration of technology, changing job roles, and the need for ongo ing reskilling and upskilling. \nResearch in this area helps organizations understand how AI can be leveraged to enhance training \nprograms, personalize learning experiences, and ultimately improve workforce skills and \nperformance. The integration of AI in HR D offers opportunities to optimize talent management \nprocesses, including recruitment, performance evaluation, and succession planning. Moreover, AI \ntechnologies can provide data -driven insights for informed decision -making in HRD. Investigating \nthis inter section helps organizations understand how AI analytics can support strategic decision -\nmaking, align HRD initiatives with overall business goals, and contribute to organizational success. \nUnderstanding the impact of AI on HRD practices helps organizations enhance the overall employee \nexperience. Research in this area can identify how AI contributes to creating positive work \nenvironments, supports employee well -being, and fosters a culture of continuous learning and \ndevelopment. AI technologies can play a cr ucial role in fostering a culture of continuous learning \nwithin organizations. Investigating this intersection helps identify how AI -driven learning platforms, \nrecommendation systems, and adaptive training programs can contribute to building a dynamic \nand learning -oriented workplace culture.  \n \nThis study adopts a horizon scanning (HS) approach and delves into the potential of AI to enhance \nworkforce skills and performance. While literature reviews are past and present -oriented, focusing \non summarizing existing knowledge up to the point of the re view, HS is future -oriented, \nemphasizing the identification of emerging trends and developments.  Therefore, Horizon scanning \nis particularly valuable in dynamic and rapidly evolving fields, where exploring current trends and \nanticipating future developmen ts are crucial for informing the discourse on the future of the field. \nUsing HS, we scrutinize how AI is being used in Learning and Development, and how AI helps \naddress pressing workforce challenges, such as skills gaps and talent shortages, while contrib uting \nto organizational competitiveness and agility. We also explore how AI can positively impact \nemployee experience, well -being, and overall workplace culture, emphasizing the importance of \ncreating dynamic environments that support learning and developm ent. By investigating the \nintersection of AI technologies and HRD, this research not only provides valuable insights for \norganizations seeking to harness AI's potential but also offers a roadmap for navigating the \ncomplexities and opportunities.  \n \nKeywords:  AI, Learning and Development, workforce development"

These platforms offer cost -effective alternatives \nto traditional methods, reducing expenses and facilitating  scalability across various locations. Post -\npandemic shifts have highlighted the significance of digital learning in navigating hybrid work \nmodels and fostering active employee engagement in learning initiatives (Nachmias & Hubschmid -\nVierheilig, 2021).   \n \nWhile digital learning platforms offer unparalleled flexibility and personalized experiences, they also \npresent challenges such as potential isolation, technical issues, and the necessity for digital literacy \n(Borup et al., 2014). A well -crafted learning e nvironment is crucial to maximize the benefits of these \nplatforms (Mørk et al., 2020). Understanding the intricate relationship between digital learning \nplatforms and organizational factors like physical workspace, social interactions, and leadership \nsuppo rt is crucial. This comprehension enables organizations to cultivate a supportive learning \nenvironment, fostering engagement, collaboration, and personalized experiences, impacting \nemployee satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and overall performance for s ustained success in a \ncompetitive landscape.  \n \nTheoretical base  \n \nThe conceptual framework used consisted of two theoretical frameworks that formed the study's \nperspective. Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, proposed by Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979), \nfocuses on the impact of various environmental systems. This theory identifies different layers of \ninfluence, including the microsystem (individual's immediate environment), mesosystem \n(interconnections between microsystems), exosyst em (external environments indirectly affecting \nindividuals), macrosystem (societal or cultural influences), and chronosystem (time -related \ninfluences). Connectivism, formulated by Siemens (2004), focuses on learning through connections \nand networks in the digital age. It emphasizes adapting to evolving information landscapes by \ndeveloping skills to navigate networks effectively. Hence, the integration of these two theories \nestablished the framework for this study. Bronfenbrenner’s model identified the envir onmental \ncomponents, while Connectivism highlighted its significant impact on digital learning outcomes.  \n \nObjectives  \n1.

      "text": "374 \nID:99  - Working Paper - Can adopting critical approaches to evaluation \nenhance the understanding and value of knowledge exchange?  \nCatharine Ross, Lynn Nichol, Carole Elliott, Sally Sambrook  & Jim Stewart  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nPaper’s Importance  \nKnowledge exchange (KE) has been defined as ‘the wide range of activities HEPs [Higher Education \nProviders] undertake with partners’ (Research England 2023 a) to ensure that the knowledge they \nteach and create ‘can be used for the benefit of the economy an d society’ (Research England 2023 \nb). We suggest it could be conceived as a form of HRD, ‘shaping individual and group values and \nbeliefs and skilling through learning -related activities to support the desired performance of the \nhost system’ (Wang et al, 2 016). Given its increasing importance (Marzocchi et al, 2023; Atta -Owuso \nand Fitjar, 2023), we explore how KE is evaluated in a KE case study and whether its value might be \nenhanced through greater application of critical HRD evaluation approaches.  \n  \nTheoretical base  \nKE evaluation can focus on process or outcomes (Upton et al, 2014). The UK government’s current \napproaches predominantly assess outcomes, or the mere occurrence of knowledge exchange \n(Research England 2023c). Where outcome -based it tends to focus on commercia lisation metrics \nleading to concerns that certain forms of KE may be incentivised over others (Rossi and Rosli, 2015).  \nA focus on commercial outcomes defined by a narrow range of stakeholders mirrors some \northodox approaches to HRD evaluation such as derived from Kirkpatrick focusing on impact on job \nperformance and achievement of organisational goals (Reio at al, 2017). O ther approaches assess \nalternative outcomes such as increased equity for marginalised stakeholders (Bierema et al, 2024), \nrecognising alternative or wider stakeholder needs. Such approaches may reflect critical HRD by \nchallenging assumptions about interven tions (Corley and Eades, 2014) and/or highlighting \nconflicting interests (Sambrook, 2021).  \n \nResearch purpose and methods  \nThis research assesses whether existing mechanisms of KE evaluation enhance its value, for which \ngroups, and how that might be affected by the application of approaches derived from critical HRD. \nIt seeks to answer:  \n-How do case study stakeholders evaluate the KE?  \n-To what extent would these evaluations be captured by current dominant mechanisms for \nevaluating KE?  \n-To what extent would these evaluations be captured by approaches derived from orthodox HRD \npractice?  \n-How might applying critical HRD approaches to evaluation increase the value of KE?  \nThematic analysis of interviews with stakeholders in a longitudinal case study was undertaken in \nJanuary/February 2022 and December/January 2023.  \n \nImplications for HRD practice  \nThe research sets out potential implications of different approaches to evaluation for diverse KE \nstakeholders. It supports those involved in learning from KE to select evaluation approaches that \nreflect on the purpose and value of KE.  \n \nConclusions  \nApplying outcome -based approaches to HRD evaluation could ensure that KE enhances the \nperformance of the host system according to its definition of value rather than adopting"

Lee (2015) noted that HRD has a history in that: “People have been “doing” what \ncould have called HRD for many years, but these activities were not initially conceptualized as HRD – \nit is only us looking backwards that now call “it” HRD” (p. 3). Swanson and Holton (2001) trace the \nhistory of HRD in the United States with origins to the anci ent Greek and Roman era. Although, as \nPerriton (2022) observed, it is clear that Swanson and Holton discount these classical origin roots in \nthe historical foundation narrative of mid -20th century development of HRD.  \nAs an applied discipline, HRD is not unique in exploration of ancient Roman origins that inform \ncurrent conceptualizations of theory and practice. Historiographies on labor management (Van der \nLinden, 2010) and project management (Seymour & Hussein, 2014) have highlighted that large -scale \nprojects like the Egyptian pyramids, China’s Great Wall, or Hadrian’s Wall show origins of people \nmanagement including training, development, and leadership. Yet, historical studies with direct \nevidence of practices that a lign with contemporary conceptualizations of HRD are scant.  \n \nTheoretical base  \nThe theoretical concept of place remains largely absent from HRD research. To explore the \nphenomenological dimensions of a place and its relative connection and contribution to the history \nof training, in this case at Hadrian’s Wall, required extension bey ond one single discipline or theory \nfor a broader and diverse framework of understanding (Gruenewald, 2003). The theoretical \nframework drew from history, geography border studies, and Heideggerian philosophy applied to \nthe activity -based experience followi ng the “walking and knowing the past tradition” documented by \nthe historian Readman (2021). Application of this theoretical framework allowed the ‘Wall’ to serve \nas a geographic zone for temporal, spatial and experiential dimensions to examine aspects of t he \nhistory of HRD.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThe purpose of this study was to conduct an interdisciplinary investigation into historical evidence \nof training associated with the construction and operation of the Roman built Hadrian’s Wall in \nnorthern England. The significance of this study is despite  mention of the training required to build \nand operate the Hadrian’s Wall, no investigation has focused on the collective evidence and \nconsequently, the role of training in Roman Britain as a core aspect in the narrative of the origins of \nHRD is limited.  \n \nResearch question/s  \nThe broad research question was: What evidence of activity related to current conceptualizations of \ntraining as a core HRD practice are associated with Hadrian’s Wall during the period of AD 122 -410 .  \nThis study used a combination of research methods drawing from a diverse range of academic \ndisciplines. However, the overarching method drew from research in adventure education, outdoor \nlearning, and leisure studies with an ethnographic approach considere d vital to contextualize \nauthentic interactions between person and place (Kennedy, MacPhail, & Varley, 2020).

Environmental changes resulting fr om globalization and digitalization \nrequire us to acquire knowledge and skills more frequently and continuously. In particular, higher \neducation educators are responsible for cultivating talent who can respond to these changes. \nTherefore, due to their prof essional obligations and the digitalizing work, they are the first to face \nthe need for T&D to embrace the change. Due to a lack of T&D opportunities or quality, the job \nsatisfaction (JS) of employees who cannot keep up with these change demands can drop \nsignificantly, increasing turnover intentions (Mouaddib et al., 2023; Mahboub et al., 2023).  \nMobley (1977) proposed an early model linking employee turnover intention (TI) to JS and \nidentifying attitudinal, decisional, and behavioral dimensions (Mobley, 1983). Based on the model, \nmany scholars have reported a negative relationship between JS and T I (Ait Alla, 2019; Andoh, 2021; \nBerguig, 2019; Fite, 2022; Hanaty, 2022; Memon, 2016;) and the determinants of TI (Hajjami, 2023). \nHowever, little research links them with T&D, although continuous learning is becoming more \nimportant in a rapidly changing o rganizational environment. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, even \nthough T&D is an important issue for organizations, including higher education institutions, \nresearch on this topic that targets them is limited. Therefore, this study aims to examine the impa ct \nof T&D on JS and TI of faculty in higher education and to investigate whether T&D moderates the \nrelationship between JS and TI. The research questions are as follows.  \n \n1) What is the relationship between T&D and JS?  \n2) What is the relationship between T&D and TI?  \n3) What is the relationship between JS and IT?  \n4) Does T&D moderate the relationship between JS and TI?  \n \nThe sample consists of about 150 to 200 faculty members in a university in Morocco, including full -\ntime, part -time, and lecturers who have been employed at the institution for more than one year \nand have participated in the faculty T&D programs at least fo ur times in the past year. Data will be \ncollected through a survey, and regression analysis will be used to reveal the relationships between \nvariables and the moderating effect of T&D.   \n \nBy unraveling the relationships among these variables, this study is expected to provide insight into \nstrategies that can increase employee satisfaction, improve performance, and reduce turnover \namong the university faculty, emphasizing the importance of T &D in the globalization and digital \nage. Furthermore, despite being a limited context, this study will contribute to filling the gap in HRD \nresearch as an empirical study conducted in a Moroccan higher education setting.  \n \nKeywords:  Training and development, job satisfaction, turnover intention"

As the business environment continuously evolves due to \ntechnological advancements, the significance of knowledge sharing  becomes indispensable for \norganizations that are seeking to establish a lasting competitive advantage. Knowledge sharing, a \ncritical component of organizational effectiveness, is defined as the transmission of individual \nexpertise or problem -solving skill s to the larger collective (Bock et al., 2005). Knowledge sharing \nincludes employees’ voluntary sharing of relevant information to support goal achievement, \ncollaborative problem -solving, and innovation (Ipe, 2003; Wang & Noe, 2010). The study will employ \na 5-item scale (Bock et al., 2005) to measure knowledge sharing behaviors that are categorized into \nexplicit and implicit dimensions. The items reflect the extent to which employees share reports, \ndocuments, experience, and expertise with team members in o rder to examine their contribution to \nthe knowledge -sharing process.  \n \nIn recent years, psychological safety has gained practical significance, which was partially the result \nof an increased emphasis on learning and innovation within contemporary organizations \n(Edmondson & Lei, 2014). The concept of psychological safety, whic h is defined as employees’ trust \nthat their thoughts and vulnerabilities will be treated respectfully and without repercussions \n(Edmondson, 1999), is central to this inquiry. Psychological safety is the atmosphere in which people \nfeel free to express their  ideas, express their worries, and take risks without fear of retaliation. A 7 -\nitem scale will be used to evaluate this construct (Edmondson, 1999), which measures how much \nteam dynamics encourage candid communication, taking calculated risks, and apprecia ting \nindividual contributions.  \n \nIn terms of organizational competitiveness, employees’ well -being and knowledge sharing are \nbecoming essential elements. Berraies et al. (2020) revealed that knowledge sharing uses employee \nwell-being as a lever. Bietry and Creusier (2013) conceptualized e mployees’ well -being as a two -\ndimensional concept integrating both eudaimonic and hedonic aspects. George and Brief (1992) \nand Wang et al. (2017) emphasized that hedonic aspects of well -being, such as happiness, pleasure, \nenjoyment, and satisfaction regard ing the physical work environment, encourage employees to \nshare their knowledge with their colleagues and spread cooperation and kindness. Additionally, \nknowledge sharing is fostered by the eudaimonic aspects of well -being, which include personal \ngrowth, a  sense of purpose in life, and supervisors’ recognition and compassion. Knowledge \nworkers may believe that their managers value their talents and consider their intrinsic needs, \nwhich inspires them to share their knowledge and assist others, if they are se eking autonomy, a \nchallenging work environment, and personal progress (Chumg et al., 2016).  \nWe will employ a quantitative research approach to examine these relationships at an individual \nlevel of analysis. Data will be collected through surveys that will be given to IT engineers in large \ncompanies in South Korea. We plan to collect 300 samples f or analysis. Structural equation \nmodeling (SEM) will be used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of psychological safety on \nknowledge sharing with employees’ well -being as a mediator. The measurement model will assess \nthe reliability and validity o f the measurement indicators for psychological safety and knowledge \nsharing."

It follows \nand adjourns Tomé, 2013, who analysed the period 1986 -2008. It is an important question given \nthat in the next years the EU plans to invest a lot on Portuga l through the ESF. It is decisive to make \nan update on that assessment,  \n \nTheoretical base  \nThe paper is based in the concept of National HRD as defined by McLean, 2014.. In recent years \nNational HRD models have been applied in more and more countries like the USA (Knowles, Holton \nand Swanson, 2011), China (Liu and Wall, 2005), India (Srimannaray ana,2009), Russia (Zavialova, \n2011) Brazil (Sparkman. 2015) or Japan (Warner 1984, Werner, 1994). We assume that the ESF is a \nform of investment in HRD made using EU funds, and those funds should produce some form of \ninvestment (European Commission, 2017) . The investments has costs, and should generate \nbenefits in terms of wages, . -(Gramlich, 1997), In order to access those policies basically two types of \nmethodologies exist: based on results, answering the question – what happened ? and based on \nimpacts ?  based on the question – what difference did the investment make ? (Tomé, 2005). The first \nquestion is important but the second is really the central one when evaluating HRD policies. Rather \nsignificantly, HRD policies have been evaluated in fine form in t he OECD countries (Tomé, 2001).  \n \nMethods  \nWe will use a three steps methodology The first level follows Garavan, Morley and McCharty, 2016; \ntherefore we begin to describe the basic setting of HRD in the three countries analysed in the paper; \nthe items to be addressed are the following: 1) context background; 2) broad vocational education \nand training (VET) systems; 3) institutional actors; 4) political context. In the second level we \nspecifically detail the HRD policies basing ourselves in Tomé 2012 and Tomé 2013); the following \ntopics addressed; 1) basic legislative documents, 2) guidelines on eligibility, 3) programs, 4) \nevaluation procedures. Finally, in the thir d and deepest level we analyse the policies outcomes in \nline with (Tomé and Goyal, 2016); specifically, we address the following topics: 1) stocks, investment, \nand outcomes; 2) price, quantity, supply, demand, equilibria; 3) needs. The three levels enable us to \nanswer to the paper’s research question.  \n \nResearch question/s  \nThe research question is - what is the impact of the ESF in Portugal since 2009 ?  In order to answer \nto that research question we will use data published by the national administration  and will also \ncompare our findings with studies which have already be en done and are available in the SCOPUS \ndatabase.  \n \nImplications for HRD practice  \nThe assessment should give guidelines on how to improve the investment of HRD in countries \nsupported by the European Social Fund  \n \nConclusions  \nAt this stage we believe we will conclude that the high level of investment is not always matched by \nquality standards. indeed, a \"paradox of absorption\" may be observed, in which the investment is a \nwaste of money and may be even be  counter -productive.  \n \nKeywords:  Portugal, HRD, History"

In fact it marks 50 years since the coup of \nApril 25th 1974, which was ensued by a revolutionary period that ended in 25th November of 1975, \nfollowing which a democratic constitution was approved in 1976. Therefore Portugal is celebrating \n50 years of democracy and freedom. Crucially, before democracy the country had also 48 years of a \ndictatorship, in which HR were not a priority. In fact before 1974 HRD in Portugal was elitist, \ninformal or externa l (Tomé, 2007).  \n \nTherefore it is very important and interesting to try to analyse the situation of HRD in Portugal in \nthree points in time: 1926, 1974 and 2023.

In recent years \nNational HRD models have been applied in more and more countries like the USA (Knowles, Holton \nand Swanson, 2011), China (Liu and Wall, 2005), India (Srimannaray ana,2009), Russia (Zavialova, \n2011) Brazil (Sparkman. 2015) or Japan (Warner 1984, Werner, 1994). The investment in HRD has \ncosts, and should generate benefits in terms of wages, . -(Gramlich, 1997), In order to access those \npolicies basically two types of methodologies exist: based on results, answering the question – what \nhappened ? and based on impacts ? based on the question – what difference did the investment \nmake ? (Tomé, 2005). The first question is important but the second is really the central one when \nevaluating HRD policies. Rather significantly, HRD policies have been evaluated in fine form in the \nOECD countries (Tomé, 2001).  \n \nMethods  \nWe will use a three steps methodology The first level follows Garavan, Morley and McCharty, 2016; \ntherefore we begin to describe the basic setting of HRD in the three countries analysed in the paper; \nthe items to be addressed are the following: 1) context background; 2) broad vocational education \nand training (VET) systems; 3) institutional actors; 4) political context. In the second level we \nspecifically detail the HRD policies basing ourselves in Tomé 2012 and Tomé 2013); the following \ntopics addressed; 1 ) basic legislative documents, 2) guidelines on eligibility, 3) programs, 4) \nevaluation procedures. Finally, in the third and deepest level we analyse the policies outcomes in \nline with (Tomé and Goyal, 2016); specifically, we address the following topics:  1) stocks, investment, \nand outcomes; 2) price, quantity, supply, demand, equilibria; 3) needs. The three levels enable us to \nanswer to the paper’s research question. We want to use these three levels for the three situations \ncirca 1926 (before the dictato rship), 1974 (end of the dictatorship) and 2024 (after 50 years of \ndemocracy) and to make useful comparisons.  \n \nResearch Questions  \nHow can we compare the situations of HRD in Portugal for 1926, 1974 and 2023 ? What are the \nmain ideas that can be derived from that comparison ?  \nImplications for HRD practice"

The concentration of financi al institutions can result in a lack of competition, \nlimiting choices for consumers and negatively affecting innovation. The restricted autonomy of \nprofessionals in these institutions contrasts with the supposed independence of autonomous \nprofessionals, br inging up the issue of credibility. Amidst these complexities, financial education \nemerges as a fundamental pillar. The lack of financial understanding contributes to inadequate \ndecisions, making it clear the need for a more informed population. Additional ly, solid regulation \nstands out as vital to ensuring transparency, protecting the interests of clients, and promoting \nhealthier competition. In this point, the theoretical approach reflects the interconnection between \nconflicts of interest, lack of competi tion, the need for autonomy, and the centrality of financial \neducation and regulation in enhancing financial services.  \n \nThe debate on the quality of financial services in Brazil is propelled by a complex intersection of \nchallenges, extensively explored through studies conducted by organizations such as the OECD \n(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the ENEF (National Strategy for \nFinancial Education in Brazil), along with insights fro m renowned researchers including Annamaria \nLusardi and Richard Thaler, Stephen Ball, and others. Issues such as conflicts of interest in large \ninstitutions, indicated by corporate goals that may supersede client interests, and market \nconcentration leading to innovation stagnation, are pivotal. The discourse also encompasses limited \nautonomy in major institutions and the necessity for credibility in autonomous professionals. \nAmidst these intricacies, the paramount role of financial education becomes evident,  with its gaps \ncontributing to inadequate financial decisions. Thus, the debate transcends these elements, \naddressing conflicts, fostering competition, ensuring autonomy, and underscoring the need for a \nmore financially literate population, as underscored by Financial Brazilian entities.  \nThe discourse surrounding the quality of financial services in Brazil is a nuanced exploration, \ndelving into the multifaceted impact of financial literacy, as elucidated by institutions like the OECD \nand ENEF. Amidst the backdrop of debates about professio nals in large financial institutions, a \nprominent theme emerges — the transformative influence of financial education. The inadequacies \nin financial literacy not only compromise individual decision -making but reverberate through the \nbroader economic landsca pe. \n \nCrucially interlinked with this is the realm of behavioral economics, as spearheaded by scholars like \nwas mentioned before. Their work accentuates how cognitive biases and informational asymmetry, \nexacerbated by a lack of financial education, can lead to s uboptimal financial choices. The \nconsequences extend beyond individual portfolios, impacting the overall economic stability.  \nRecognizing this, the debate extends beyond the mere autonomy of professionals and touches \nupon the fundamental need for a financially literate populace. Brazilian financial and capital market \nentities echo this sentiment, emphasizing the vital role of fin ancial education in cultivating informed \ndecision -makers. This comprehensive understanding; of the interconnectedness between \neducation, behavioral economics, and broader economic health; underscores the imperative for not \nonly autonomy in financial advisi ng but, more fundamentally, the imperative for a populace \nequipped with the knowledge to make sound financial decisions.  \nThe discourse on the quality of financial services in Brazil is enriched by considering the perspective \nof Human Resource Development (HRD) practices.

Effective HRD strategies not only promote continuous \neducation in financial literacy but also cultivate an organizational culture that values ethics and \ntransparency. By encouraging responsible autonomy and ethical decis ion-making, HRD practices \ncan be a fundamental tool in mitigating conflicts of interest in financial institutions.  \nFurthermore, in the context of behavioral economics, HRD practices can be implemented to raise \nawareness of cognitive biases and promote a customer -centric approach. HRD initiatives aimed at \npromoting diversity and inclusion can also play a crucial role, ensuring that financial institutions \nreflect a wide range of perspectives and experiences.  \n \nThus, by considering HRD practices as an integral component of this debate, it is possible to \nstrengthen the connection between financial education, behavioral economics, and ethics in \ndecision -making, contributing to a more holistic approach to improving financial services.  \nThe discussion on the quality of financial services in Brazil reaches a climax by integrating the \nvarious facets examined throughout this dialogue. By exploring the influence of Human Resource \nDevelopment (HRD) practices and their intersection with financi al education and behavioral \neconomics, crucial perspectives emerge to enhance the dynamics of the sector.  \nStarting with financial education, the identified gaps reveal not only individual challenges but also \nsystemic implications for economic stability. Financial literacy is not just an individual skill; it is a \nfoundation for an economically resilient society . International organizations like the OECD and \nnational initiatives, exemplified by ENEF, emphasize the importance of an informed population for \nsustainable development.  \n \nDelving into behavioral economics, in this study the highlights of how cognitive biases can shape \nfinancial choices. This understanding is a call to action for HRD practices, as professionals need to \nbe equipped to understand and mitigate these biases, pro moting a customer -centric and ethical \napproach.  \n \nThe inclusion of HRD practices emerges as a crucial piece in this puzzle. Ongoing empowerment, \ncoupled with an organizational culture that values ethics and diversity, not only strengthens the \nautonomy of professionals but also acts as a buffer against con flicts of interest. HRD is not merely a \ndepartment within organizations; it is a facilitator of cultural transformations, vital to align \ninstitutional interests with those of clients.  \n \nTherefore, the unequivocal conclusion is that the quality of financial services in Brazil cannot be \ndissociated from the continuous investment in financial education and HRD practices that foster \nethics, diversity, and adaptation to the nuances of behavior al economics. Only through this synergy \ncan one envision a scenario where financial professionals, institutions, and, more crucially, clients \nthrive in a dynamic and equitable financial ecosystem.  \n \nIn summary, by aligning financial education, behavioral economics, and HRD practices, Brazil can \npave the way for a positive transformation in the financial sector, elevating not only the quality of \nservices but also the confidence and security of citizens  in their financial journeys.  \n \nKeywords:  financial, services, education, behavioral, market and professionals."

In addition, reserah has focused \non  structured creativity training interventions (SCTIs) as  a key approach to developing the creativity \nknowledge, skills, and abilities (CKSAs) of employees. A key gap in the literature concerned what \nhappens post -structured training and  specifically what do managers do to  enhance their CKSAs.  In \nthis  study w e utilise self -regulated learning theory to understand the learning  processes that FLMs \nengage in to further develop their CKSAs and achieve creative performance.  \n \nWe focused on FLMs who are central to managing employees in hotels and help them to deliver \nhigh levels of customer service (Garavan et al., 2022). This provides the common characteristics \nlinking our study participants, who represented four hotels located  in Northern Ireland. Rather than \nselecting a single organisation, we approached a number of hotels that had the development of CPS \nas a key priority for FLMs. The hotels employed between 50 -100 staff and were classified as three -\nand four -star hotels targe ting an upper -midlevel market. Each hotel operated in a highly \ncompetitive market, and the requirement for developing creative and innovative service solutions \nwas considered imperative for market share. The hotels have been operating for over 20 years and  \nhad a well -established market position. Within each hotel, we derived a sample of 50 FLMs in key \ndivisions (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR, Rooms -Division, Food and Beverage).  \n \nWe used semi -structured interviews because of their potential to facilitate the exploration of \nunderexamined phenomena or constructs and to generate micro -level information “that presents \nthe phenomenon of interest in its variety and complexity” (Katz, 2004: 83). First, prior to the training \nsession, we interviewed the HR/General Manager within each hotel to provide data on the industry \ncontext and und erstand current initiatives to promote FLMs’ creativity. Second, three months post -\ntraining session, we interviewed the 23 managers who completed the training and focused don \ntheir CKSAs development post  training and  their creative performance. Our findi ngs highlight that \nthe structured training intervention acted as an important  external stimulus for CKSA development \nin the workplace and  surface five key phases of CKDA development and  performance: preparation, \naction,  consolidation,  performance and self-assessment. In doing so we combine both cognitive \nand behavioural perspectives and their role in achieving creative performance by FLMs  post \ntraining.  \n \nKeywords:  Structured creativity training intervention; post training learning processes,  hospitality \norganisations, self -regulated learning."

Building \nupon previous research into the role of HR Professionals the aim o f this study is to identify core \ncompetences and learning processes unique to HR Business Partner (HRBP) roles by investigating \nthe presence of a HRBP Community of Practice (CoP) existing across multiple organisations.  \n \nTheoretical foundations  \nIn recent times the HRM function has evolved to facilitate better strategic partnership with other \norganizational functions and departments. Building upon previous research (McCracken et al, 2017; \nKegan et al, 2019;  Bennett et al, 2023), this study invest igated issues linked to HR Business Partners \n(HRBP) professional development and understanding the challenges they face when building and \nmaintaining relationships with functional / departmental managers and other HR colleagues. The \nfindings from these pre vious studies revealed that HRBPs often find themselves at the centre of a \ndilemma in relation to their roles and need to possess key leadership competencies linked to \nemotional intelligence, decision making and managing complex political scenarios when th ey are \ndrawn into operational issues which are formally not part of their duties. It was also found that they \noften found themselves in quite an isolated position where because of their roles they were never \nfully aligned to the HR function, because of the ir distance from central HR, but never fully integrated \ninto the function they served due to their background in HR versus the business.  With this in mind \nthe concept of Communities of Practice emerged as a theoretical position which might help us to \nbetter understand how HRBPs could benefit from mutual learning and development opportunities.   \nIn keeping with Pritchard & Fear’s (2015) perspective of expertise as ‘practice -based’, social learning \nand Community of Practice (CoP) theory will provide a lens f or looking beyond individual \norganisations to explore a wider HRBP practice.  Described as social containers of competence by \nWenger (2000), CoPs are “considered bounded social groups identifiable where individuals are \nunited around the three components of  joint enterprise, mutuality and shared repertoire” (O’Kane, \n2020: 2).  \n \nMethodology/analytical techniques  \nData collection is ongoing, commencing in January 2024 but dependent on access will conclude in \nMay 2024.   The research will be based upon a number of case studies undertaken with \norganisations (up to five) in various sectors in the UK through a series of  semi structured interviews \nand focus groups.

Rousseau  \n \nABSTRACT  \nStrategic business partner status represents something of a holy grail for HR/D practitioners with \nprogression towards strategic business partner status still proving challenging (Lawler and \nBoudreau, 2012). One of the greatest challenges faced is gaining legitimacy and relevance in the \neyes of top management (Claus and Collison, 2005) and skepticism concerning the performance \nimpact of HR practices and interventions (Legge, Guest and King, 2004). Improving top management \ntrust in HR/D professionals (Aldric h et al., 2015) is a strategic imperative due to top management \nattitudes to HR/D being a critical foundation for successful HR/D initiatives (Guest and Bos -Nehles, \n2013; Chadwick, Super, and Kwon, 2015).  \n \nWe propose that a key mechanism to enhance trust between HR/D professionals and top \nmanagement is evidence based HR/D practice including HR/D data analytics. The use of HR metrics \nis identified as critical for establishing HR function credibility (Aldrich et al., 2015; Lawler and \nBoudreau, 2012, Marler and Boudreau, 2017). However, there is limited sophisticated empirical \nevidence (Marler and Boudreau, 2017). Further still, available research illustrates little strategic use \nof evidence based HR and HR anal ytics (Rasmussen and Ulrich, 2015; Gubbins, Harney and van der \nWerff, 2018; Lawler and Boudreau, 2015).  \n \nFurthermore, in terms of enhancing trust in HR/D professionals, a data informed narrative is argued \nto directly impact perceptions of a HR practitioner’s professionalism and conscientiousness \n(Rousseau and Barends, 2011). These qualities have clear paralle ls with the sub facets of \ntrustworthiness - ability, benevolence and integrity. However, HR analytics in the absence of an \nevidence based decision making approach may actually undermine trust in HR/D professional’s \nability to contribute at strategic level. This failure to effectively use measures is usually attributed to \nthe fact that those receiving the information lack the cognitive frameworks to make sense of the \ninformation (such as understanding how an engagement score or a turnover rate connects to \nbusiness success) (Lawler and Boudreau, 2015) or lack the type of analytic and data based decision -\nmaking capability needed to influence business strategy (Lawler, Levenson and Boudreau, 2004). \nWhile HR analytics may offer an opportunity to demonstrate a part icular aspect of ability, without a \nclear connection to organizational strategy it may actually undermine perceptions of ability to \ncontribute at a strategic level. Moreover in this format, it almost certainly lacks the potential for \ndemonstrating the alig nment of goals and values necessary to build perceptions of benevolence \nand integrity. In contrast, evidence based practice offers a more comprehensive opportunity to \ndemonstrate ability along with benevolence and integrity by using data and analytics to a sk a valid \nquestion of importance to the business strategy and aggregate that data to answer that question \nand contribute towards organizational level goals.  \n \nThus we propose empirical investigation into if evidence based HR/D practice is a mechanism to \nenhance trust in HR/D professionals and confidence in HR/D decision making. We use an \nexperimental design using experimental vignettes. This is an established re search method in \npsychology and HR research. It involves designing ideal and hypothetical scenarios whereby \nrespondents are asked to make choices based on the information provided. Assignment to \nexperimental conditions is randomized enabling researchers to  make causal inferences that are not \nfeasible in observational studies. Experiments alleviate issues with construct clarity, in this instance \nenabling us to provide a direct assessment of the impact of evidence (Di Stefano and Gutierrez \n2019).

It is crucial for o rganizations to understand how to \nrespond to middle -aged workers’ needs of transition and development. However, middle -aged \nworkers have been largely left out of appropriate career guidance and support from their \norganizations due to the reduced investment  in training and development. Recently, to uphold \norganizational sustainability, the critical needs for middle -aged workers’ career development and \nadvancement have regained great interest from both scholars and practitioners (Kooij et al., 2020; \nVan Dijk,  2004). Despite the needs, the limited existent research has generated rather diverse but \nineffective interventions for middle -aged workers’ career, which are often broad and difficult to \noperationalize in practice (Creed et al., 2009; Zanjari et al., 2016 ). Therefore, to advance research \nand practice, this study presents empirical evidence conducive to better understand middle -aged \nworkers’ career and aging at work by examining their informal learning mechanisms. Situated in the \nturbulent business environm ent, how middle -aged workers cope with the changes and strive to \nadvance their career and performance will be examined.

It also intends to provide insights on how to \ndevelop middle -aged workers’ adaptability to guide futur e studies on adaptive performance in HRD \nresearch and practice. It holds significance in HRD for two main reasons: (a) identifying the \nrelationship between middle -aged workers’ informal learning and adaptive performance, and (b) \npresenting empirical findin gs for both researchers and practitioners to better understand middle -\naged workers’ career resilience and adaptability.  \n \nResearch Questions  \n1.

In today's multifaceted and dynamic comm ercial landscape, the ability \nto effectively manage and share knowledge has been identified as a critical behavior that can \nincrease an organization’s competitiveness since no single individual possesses all the knowledge \nthat is necessary for success in t oday’s complex and rapidly changing business environment (Han et \nal., 2022). In order to sustain competitiveness, organizations must adeptly cultivate, acquire, \ndevelop, share, and apply knowledge in an effective and efficient manner (Lemon & Sahota, 2004) . \nThe creation of a systemic learning culture in organizations becomes an optimal source for \nacquiring these skills (Senge, 1990; Watkins & Marsick, 1993). Gavin and Edmondson (2008) posited \nthat building a learning organization through certain learning -related behaviors and competencies \nthat other organizations cannot easily imitate is the only way to increase organizational \nsustainability. In order to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing within organizations, it is \nessential to create opportunities f or members within the organization to learn from members of the \norganization (Ulrich et al., 1993). This process requires providing opportunities for individuals to \nlearn from each other and to cultivate a desire for learning within the organization.  \nDespite the recognized importance of knowledge management and sharing in organizations, \ncorporate entities grapple with the volatility and intricacies of the business milieu. One of the \nprimary challenges is the uncertainty and complexity of the current bu siness environment. With the \nrise of globalization, technological advancements, and increased competition, organizations are \nfacing unprecedented levels of uncertainty and complexity. In this context, it becomes difficult to \nidentify and acquire the necess ary knowledge to succeed. Moreover, sharing knowledge and \ninformation within an organization is not always straightforward. In many cases, individuals may be \nreluctant to share their knowledge and expertise because they either perceive their knowledge as a  \nsource of personal power or fear that sharing their knowledge will lead to a loss of job security or \nstatus (Cabrera & Cabrera, 2002). Additionally, the workplace may maintain an inappropriate \nreward system or inadequate recognition for knowledge -sharing efforts, which can discourage \nemployees from sharing their knowledge. All of these factors contribute to situations in which \nknowledge sharing at the organizational level remains a challenge.  \n \nIn our hyperconnected reality, employees’ psychological comfort, buttressed by organizational \ncultures of risk -taking and mutual respect, is crucial (Joo, 2020). Such a process involves the creation \nof an environment, procedures, and behavior that support the acquisition, creation, and sharing of \nnew knowledge by employees. In order to achieve this sharing, organizations need to foster a \nlearning culture that encourages and supports the ongoing acquisition of new knowledge and skills \nby its members (Garvin et al., 2008). Thus, this study posits that psychological safety significantly \ninfluences the emergence of a learning organization culture, which, in turn, catalyzes knowledge \nsharing.  \n \nBased on the research framework, this study was conducted using the knowledge management \ncommunity of Chaebol companies in South Korea. We employed structural equation modeling using \nAMOS 28 to assess the hypothesized model. The theoretical and practical i mplications of this study \nare as follows. This study explores a positive and significant effect of psychological safety on the \nformation of learning organization culture and a positive direct effect of learning organization"

Mulder, Theresa Hartl, Tai Nguyen  & Louisa Siemens  \n \nABSTRACT  \n \nTechnological developments in society lead to changes at work, also in healthcare (Cascio & \nMontialegre, 2016). Such changes can lead to new, additional tasks, that are pivotal for good \nperformance, but not always visible, nor recognized. About this so -called metawork (e.g., Aroles, et \nal., 2022) little is known, especially in situations of changes in work due to new technologies, nor \nabout the learning activities that emerge from that. These insights are needed to be able to foster \nongoing professional dev elopment required for current and future work. The research questions \nare: What are components of metawork in nursing in the context of changes in work tasks due to \nthe introduction of new technologies? What is the meaning of the relationships between \ncomp onents of metawork and professional development activities that emanate from it?  \nProfessional development consists of three categories of learning activities: ‘elaboration’, \n‘expansion’ and ‘externalization’ (Simons & Ruijters, 2004). Different kinds of metawork conceptions \nexist: metawork is considered as work tasks that makes the act ual work possible (Aroles et al., \n2022), or as person related components consisting of personal competences or behaviour (Müller -\nTeusler, 2013). Metawork can be invisible to the external social environment (Star & Strauss, 1999), \nand be not recognized (Hat ton, 2017).  \n \nThis explorative interview study among nurses confronted with new technologies (e.g., patient \nmanagement software system), uses the Interview To The Double Technique (Nicolini, 2009) for \ninvestigating the components of metawork, and the Critical Incident T echnique (Flanagan, 1954) to \ndiscover emanating learning activities. An interview guideline was developed and tested and then \nused for the data collection. We will present two cases, i.e., the work of two nurses, in detail and \ncompare these in relation to the characteristics of work that have changed, the components of \nmetawork that are generated, and the activities that are caused.  \nExamples of the different conceptualizations of metawork are found. For example, a new, required, \nand invisible, task is ‘regularly checking and exchanging the batteries of the laptops’. A person \nrelated component was ‘organizing and planning capability’. Emanating learning activities are for \ninstance ‘reflection on possible solutions and actions for new encountered problems’ (elaboration), \n‘asking colleagues for help’ (expansion), and ‘developing a timetable for colleagues with all the to -\ndo’s’ (externaliz ation). We will present two cases and use the results of the analysis and the \ncomparison as a basis for the development of hypotheses that can be tested in further studies.   \n \nReferences (selection)  \nAroles, J., Bonneau, C., & Bhankaraully, S.

Although post -secondary degrees attempt \nto fill an important gap in credentialing for the workforce, the value of the college experience is \ncoming under scrutiny (Barrow & Malamud, 2015; Deller & Parr, 2020). While policy makers a nd \nparents continue to push the nation's youth to enter college, the cost of attending college is \nincreasing and students are borrowing more than ever to finance the investment (Oreopoulos & \nPetronijevic, 2013). The devaluation of college is a phenomenon t hat has been cited and \ndocumented for a seventy -five-year period dating back from 1945 to 2020, in a period where \neducation was previously acknowledged as a primary path into the Middle Class (Wingard, 2022). \nBased on an analysis of survey data from (Natio nal Center for Education Statistics, 2022), average \nloan balances for students who completed a research or professional doctorate increased between \n1999 –2000 and 2015 –16 for all degree programs for which data were available. For example, the \naverage loan b alances approximately doubled for those who completed 1) medical doctorates (from \n$124,700 to $246,000, an increase of 97 percent); 2) Ph.D. degrees outside the field of education \n(from $48,400 to $98,800, an increase of 104 percent); and 3) other non -Ph.D . doctorates (from \n$64,500 to $132,200, an increase of 105 percent).  \n \nThe literature shows that the understanding of prospective students’ behavior in selecting a \nuniversity program is subjectively constructed through their personal growth, career aspirations, \nand academic and financial resources (Baker, 2017). Using Collins  Theory of Credentialing, Self -\nDirected Learning Theory, and Innovation Diffusion Theory the purpose of this conceptual working \npaper is to understand how people learn about the programs they apply for and the reasons for \ntheir decision making in selecting  the most promising program for their future. The impact of \nresources, both social and financial, as well as the marketing means utilized to sell the promise of a \ncollege or university program in the form of an ideation of some professional excellence to \nprospective students will also be explored and implications for HRD will be discussed.  \n \nReferences  \n \nBaker, R.

Katz and Kahn's (1978) open system theory serves as a foundational perspective, \nemphasizing the pivotal role of roles within social structu res. Life, when understood in hindsight, \npropels the evolution of change. This paper systematically traverses from classical to contemporary \nviews of change, encapsulating the essence of organizational roles, human behavior, ontological \nperspectives, parad ox, time, and becoming. While Katz and Kahn's theory, rooted in the 60s and \n70s, sheds light on social systems and roles, it reveals limitations in considering the dynamic \ninterplay of human behavior and the broader environment.  \nIn the contemporary understanding, change is not merely an occasional disruption but a routine, \ncomplex, and paradoxical phenomenon. Resistance, often perceived negatively, emerges as a \npotent catalyst for change. Organizational identity extends beyond mer e attributes, embodying \ntensions and historical context. Paradoxes, inherent in the tapestry of organizational life, shape our \nactions in ways that are both contradictory and interdependent. Time, a constant presence, exerts a \nprofound influence on the flu ctuating nature of change. Becoming, integral to contemporary \nperspectives, views change as pervasive, continuous, and either owned or unowned by \norganizational actors.  \n \nThis paper's contribution extends beyond theoretical exploration, finding practical relevance in the \nrealm of organizational training and development. By offering a comprehensive understanding of \nchange dynamics, it equips practitioners with invaluable ins ights into managing resistance and \nleveraging paradoxical tensions for positive transformation. The exploration of ontological \nperspectives and the temporal aspect of change further aids in developing adaptive strategies for \ncontinuous improvement.  \n \nOrganizational roles, as expounded by Katz and Kahn (1978), serve as the cornerstone in the \nclassical understanding of change. Their open system theory emphasizes the interconnectedness \nbetween a structure and its supporting environment, attributing human effort and motivation as \ncrucial for organizational maintenance. Roles, norms, and values are identified as the interrelated \nbases for the integration of organizations. However, this classical model, developed in the late 60s \nand 70s, offers limited insights into the intricacies o f human behavior and environmental \ninfluences.  \n \nMoving to a contemporary lens, change is no longer perceived as an occasional disruption but as an \ninherent part of routine organizational processes. Amburgey et al. (1993) posit that most \norganizational changes result from stable, routine processes that a lign with environmental \ndemands. Change, therefore, is not a sporadic event but an ongoing, complex, and \nmultidimensional process deeply interwoven into the fabric of organizational life. The negative \nconnotation attached to resistance is challenged, recog nizing it as a silent force essential for \nchange. This multidimensional perspective embraces the coexistence of seemingly contradictory \nelements within the spectrum of change.  \n \nOrganizational identity emerges as a critical element in the contemporary understanding of change. \nBeyond a mere listing of attributes, organizational identity is experienced as a set of ongoing \ntensions. The COVID -19 pandemic provides a pertinent example,  forcing organizations to reevaluate"

(2015) \nemphasize that organizational identity is contextual, historical, embodied, and temporal, \nnecessitating a nuanced approach to organizational change.  \n \nParadoxes, as integral components of organizational life, play a pivotal role in shaping our \nworldview and actions. Hahn et al. (2021) assert that organizational life is besieged with paradoxical \ntensions, and contradictory yet interdependent demands that persist over time. This paradoxical \nnature of change is reflected in actions such as saving money by spending it or seeking stability \nwithin dynamic environments. The quantum approach proposed by Hahn and Knight (2021) views \nthe ontology of paradox as para doxical itself, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of \nchange.  \n \nTime, an ever -present dimension, is often overlooked in the understanding of change. Lord et al. \n(2015) argue that individual and organizational behavior fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably with \ntime, urging us to recognize the contextual nature of change . Shipp and Jansen (2021) emphasize \nthat there is no single moment where time stops; instead, change unfolds and transforms within \nthe continuum of time. This temporal perspective is crucial for acknowledging the evolving nature of \norganizational processes  and behaviors.  \n \nBecoming, a concluding element in the contemporary understanding of organizational change, \nencapsulates the idea of change as pervasive and continuous. Tsoukas and Chia (2002) assert that \norganizational becoming involves reweaving an actor's beliefs, habit s, and actions to accommodate \nnew experiences obtained through interactions. Change, from this perspective, is inherent in \nhuman action, and organizations are sites of continuously evolving human dynamics. The \nintroduction of owned and unowned change furth er underscores the paradoxical nature of \norganizational change, acknowledging the coexistence of agency, choice, and environmental forces.  \nIn summary, this paper bridges the gap between classical and contemporary views of organizational \nchange. It not only illuminates the foundational concepts of organizational roles and open system \ntheory but also delves into the multifaceted, dynamic nature  of change in contemporary \norganizational landscapes. The practical implications for organizational training and development \nlie in understanding and navigating the complexities of human behavior, embracing paradoxes, \nacknowledging the temporal dimension o f change, and fostering adaptability in the face of routine \ntransformations. As organizations grapple with unprecedented challenges, this comprehensive \nunderstanding provides a valuable roadmap for navigating the ever -evolving terrain of change. \nFuture res earch, focusing on the impact of COVID -19, technological advancements, and \nglobalization, holds the potential to further enrich our understanding of change dynamics.

The delivery and \nimpact of training does not match its perceived importance and employees do not have sufficient \ninteractive skills to maximise the relationship between the mselves and guests (Nikadimovs and \nIvanchenko, 2020).  \n \nLiterature suggests these interactive, or “soft” skills are learnable (Dhyani et al., 2020; Secchi et al., \n2020). This research examines using drama in workplace training to deliver these interactive skills to \nfront -of-house employees in hotels.  \nComparisons between hospitality and theatre are pervasive (Gibbs and Ritchie, 2010; Ngcobo et al., \n2022), however the concept remains inadequately explored in terms of using drama -based \ntechniques to answer such questions as,  \n“What kind of training interventions should be initiated by hospitality firms to develop [interactive] \ncompetencies in their staff?” (Bharwani and Jauhari, 2013)  \n \nTheoretical Basis  \nThis research is rooted in three key theoretical areas: Training & development, hospitality, and \ndrama. The former has included understanding fundamental developments within HRD, as well as \nthe work of Paolo Freire, John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and David Kolb.  \nHospitality research has identified skills required in front -of-house roles, as well as current training \npraxis within the industry. It has been possible to identify a very few case studies where drama -\nbased techniques have been utilised in training, but e ach calls for more research in the area (Daly et \nal. 2009).  \n \nApplied drama and improvisation literature has demonstrated the potential for drama being used \noutside of traditional performance contexts.

The \nprimary research aim is, to establish whether drama -based techniques are an effective tool for \ndelivering interactive skills to customer -facing employees in the hotel industry. The researcher will \nbe carrying out a drama -based workshop in hotels across Northern Ireland, as well as holding focus \ngroups with employees to determine their engagement with the method.  \n \nImplications for practice  \nWhilst there is an increasing body of literature which documents scenarios where drama has been \nused effectively in training (Huffaker and West, 2005; Benjamin and Kline, 2019), it is still an under -\nutilised training method.

Blended \nlearning has four key challenges which are incorporating flexibility, stimulating interaction, \nfacilitating students’ learning process, and fostering an affective learning climate (Boelens et al, \n2017). This study will iden tify how the apprenticeship addresses these challenges.  \nTransfer of training  \nTraining inputs, training outputs and conditions of transfer are the focus of training transfer \n(Baldwin & Ford, 1988). Most studies focus on training inputs. Mediating factors to trainee \ncharacteristics are (but not exhaustive) motivation (Ali, Tufail & Khan 2022), locus of control (Cheng \n& Ho 2001); perceived utility, (Chung, Gully, & Lovelace 2017) and self -efficacy (Na -Nan and \nSanamthong, 2020). Design principles consider identical elements, general principles, and stimulus \nvariability. Newer concepts such as behaviour modelling (Murthy et al. 2008), error management \n(Ran & Huang 2019), and utilising a realistic training  environment (Grossman and Salas 2011) are \nconsidered. Regarding the work environment, three sources of support have been identified as \norganisational, supervisory and peer (Hughes et al. 2020). Post training interventions of goal setting \nand relapse preve ntion (Rahyuda, Syed, &Soltani 2014) are considered along with newer work on \nimplementation intentions (Friedman & Ronen, 2015 Greenan, 2023). With the impetus to date on \ntrainee characteristics and work environment, the focus of this paper on design is no vel and \nneeded.  \n \nResearch purpose  \nThe purpose of this study is to address the limited body of support for the effectiveness of \nmanagement development programmes. This study will investigate whether the work -based nature \nof an apprenticeship coupled with the blended learning of the programm e has resulted in transfer \nof training to the job role of those taking part.  \n \nResearch question/s  \nThis is a qualitative study based on a level five management apprenticeship being delivered in one \nUK Higher Education Institute. Data will be collected from Learning Application Reports (LAR) \ncompleted by learners as part of the apprenticeship. There are three research questions as follows.  \nR1. Can a HEI deliver a non -degree apprenticeship?"

A virtual or a remote onboarding is an example of \nthe digital transformation in human resources management. Despite the growing attention in the \ndevelopment of transforming the work into the remote setting, the virtual onboarding field is still \nremarkably young, and conceptual clarity is yet to be attained. Onboarding has been identified as \nthe process that help s newcomers to adjust to the social and performance aspects of their new \ntasks quickly and efficiently (Bauer, 2010).  \n \nRemote onboarding and virtual onboarding are two terms that have been developed and used \ninterchangeably. So far these concepts and processes have been a focus since Covid -19 has \noccurred and all companies were urged to transfer their onboarding process to  an online setting \n(Yarbrough and Salazar, 2023). In fact, companies did have a virtual onboarding while the new norm \nis having a fully remote onboarding process. This paper will delve into the organizational \nsocialization theory and its inference on virtu al and remote onboarding (Van Maanen & Schein, \n1979).  \n \nA bibliometric review of virtual and remote onboarding from 2010 to 2023 was conducted on \nScopus and analyzed using the VOS viewer software package. The VOS viewer software has been \nused to construct, visualize and analyze bibliometric networks. Bibliometr ic analysis examined 67 \ndocuments. This study aimed to analyze the research trend, global distribution, contributory \njournals and conferences in virtual and remote onboarding. This paper will also focus on the \nconceptual review of the virtual and remote on boarding. The paper will also analyze the associated \nand most common keywords.  \n \nThe main research questions are first, what is the total number of studies conducted on remote and \nvirtual onboarding from 2010 to 2023? Second, what are the different keywords used in the studies \nto conceptualize virtual and remote onboarding? Finally, Ho w has the concept of remote and virtual \nonboarding evolved throughout the years, with the new norms of work?  \nThe results show an exponential growth of the topic that is still growing worldwide, without \nidentifying the difference between the two concepts. This paper will fill the gap by identifying the \ndifference between virtual and remote onboarding. The paper wi ll also review the development and \nevolution of the concepts from the human resources perspective. The present review will be helpful \nfor academicians, practitioners, and researchers in the human resources field. The study also \npresents implications that c ould help human resources practitioners and academics while designing \nand developing virtual and remote onboarding.  \n \nImplications for virtual onboarding include performing one -on-one meetings to support the \nuncertainty and doubts of newcomers (Yarbrough and Salazar, 2023). In addition to the one -on-one \nmeetings, the implications for remote onboarding would include team m eetings (Vuchkovski et al., \n2023). These team meetings would help with enhancing the psychological safety of the employees \nwithin their corresponding remote teams. Future research points in the direction of empirically \nassessing the application of the remo te onboarding while enhancing the process of remote \nonboarding in companies which would increase the satisfaction of the newcomers in return \nincrease the retention of these talents."
