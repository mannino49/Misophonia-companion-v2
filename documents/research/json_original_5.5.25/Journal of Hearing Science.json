      "text": "Journal of Hearing Science® is a quarterly, open-access journal  \npublished since 2011. This peer-reviewed journal publishes \noriginal contributions to knowledge in all areas of otolaryngology, \naudiology, phoniatrics, and rhinology, as well as in related \nfields such as speech-language pathology, speech therapy and rehabilitation, genetics, pharmacology, surgery, and biomedical \nengineering. Our goal is to provide an international forum for the exchange of knowledge in the hearing sciences. We also provide \na space for scientists to present novel theories, in the belief this \ncan make a valuable contribution to the development of science. A secondary aim is to assist the practitioners by providing \nimportant knowledge to help them work with patients with \nhearing, voice, speech, and balance disorders.J Hear Sci  publishes original articles , reviews, hypothesis \npapers, case studies , and conference proceedings . Its language \nis English. The submission, peer-review, and publishing of manuscripts is free of charge . Issues are published both in print \nand electronically at https://www.journalofhearingscience.com/• Research on humans and animals.  J Hear Sci  editors endorse \nthe principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki and expect \nthat all investigations involving humans will have been performed \nin accordance with these principles. For animal experimentation reported in the journal, it is expected that investigators will have \nobserved the Interdisciplinary Principles and Guidelines for the Use of \nAnimals in Research, Testing, and Education issued by the New York \nAcademy of Sciences Ad Hoc Committee on Animal Research. \nAll human and animal studies must have been approved by the \ninvestigator’s institutional review board.• Review process.  J Hear Sci  uses double-blind review , which \nmeans the identities of both reviewer and author are concealed from each other. Manuscripts are evaluated on the basis that they present new insights into the topic, are likely to contribute to \nresearch progress, or change clinical practice or thinking about a \ndisorder. Manuscripts are first examined by the \nJ Hear Sci editors. \nManuscripts of low quality or which contain copied material \nare promptly rejected. Incomplete packages or manuscripts \nnot prepared in the advised style are sent back to authors for adjustment. Authors are notified with a reference number \nupon registration of the manuscript at the Editorial Office, and \nmanuscripts are then sent to independent experts for scientific evaluation. Evaluation usually takes 1–3 months. Following the \npositive opinion of the reviewers, submitted papers are accepted \nfor publication. • Conflict of interests. Authors should disclose at the time \nof submission any financial arrangement they have with any company whose product figures prominently in the manuscript. Such information will be held in confidence while the paper is \nunder review and will not influence the editorial decision, but \nif the article is accepted for publication, the editors will discuss with the authors the manner in which that information will \nbe communicated to the reader. Because the essence of review \npapers is the selection and interpretation of the literature, J Hear \nSci expects that authors will not have any financial interest in a \ncompany (or its competitor) that makes a product discussed in the article.• Permissions. Material taken from other sources must be \naccompanied by a written statement from the copyright holder giving permission for reproduction. Permission in writing is needed from at least one author of papers in press, unpublished \ndata, and personal communications.• Patient confidentiality. Authors of clinical papers must ensure \nthe privacy of patients. If it is possible to identify a patient from a case report, illustration, or paper, J Hear Sci  requires written \nconsent of the patient or their guardian to publish the data. \nDescriptions of race, ethnicity, or culture of a subject should only \nbe used when they are relevant to the medical condition in the \nstudy. When categorising by race, ethnicity, or culture the terms should be as illustrative as possible and reflect the names these \ngroups themselves use.\n• Copyright and license.  Upon acceptance of an article, the authors \ngrant J Hear Sci  a non-exclusive license to publish it. The authors \nwill retain copyright under a CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 PL (Creative Commons Attribution – NonCommercial – NoDerivatives 3.0 PL license). The license allows anyone to download the article and \nshare it with others so long as they credit the authors and source, \ndo not change it in any way, and do not use it commercially. Once an article is accepted for publication, it is embargoed from \nreporting in the media until it appears on the J Hear Sci  website.\n• Disclaimer. J Hear Sci  makes diligent efforts to ensure that no \ninaccurate or misleading data, opinion, or statement appears in the journal. Statements or opinions paper reflect the views of the \nauthor(s) and not those of editors, editorial board, or publisher. Accordingly, the journal disclaims any responsibility or liability \nfor any such statement. The material appearing in advertisements \nis the responsibility of the advertiser. Efforts are made to ensure that drug doses and other quantities are presented accurately; \nnevertheless, readers are advised that methods and techniques \ninvolving drugs and other treatments described in the journal should only be followed if they accord with the manufacturer’s \nown published literature in the reader’s own country.\n• Complaints and appeals. The editors and publisher will \nrespectfully review all reasonable complaints and will deal with them \naccording to the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity \n(https://publicationethics.org/). The exceptions are: 1)  Disputes of \na personal or legal nature; 2) Complaints relating to circumstances \nthat have already been reviewed and investigated or dismissed, \nunless sufficient new evidence is provided to merit reconsideration; \n3) Repeated complaints on meritless or unsubstantiated matters; \n4) Complaints relating to articles published more than 5 years \nago from the date of the complaint; 5) Anonymous complaints; \n6) Allegations made in an offensiv e manner.\nMANUSCRIPTSThe Editorial Board will consider for publication original articles \nwith the understanding that neither the manuscript nor any part \nof its text, tables, or figures have been published previously in print or electronically and are not under consideration elsewhere. \nJ Hear Sci  requires that the corresponding author sign a statement \nthat the work has not been published previously, is completely \noriginal, and has not been submitted elsewhere for review. The \nstatement should also say that the manuscript has been read \nand approved by all authors, and that all of them meet the requirements for genuine authorship. In addition, a statement \nof financial or other relationships that might lead to a conflict of \ninterest is required.Plagiarism. The journal expects all contributions to be entirely \noriginal and the editorial office checks all manuscripts with a \ncomputer program designed to detect similarity ( iThenticate). \nWe take the issue of plagiarism seriously, and if a manuscript \nshows signs of unoriginality, it is automatically rejected and the \nauthor and their institution asked for an explanation.Journal of Hearing Science®Journal of Hearing Science®\nJournal of Hearing Science® is a peer-reviewed, open access journal issued since 2011.

      "text": "Dear Colleagues,\nIt is with great pleasure that we present the September \n2024 issue of the Journal of Hearing Science , which \nincludes some original scientific papers and the \nabstracts from two conferences �\nThe issue opens with a hypothesis paper on the use \nof artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots when searching \nfor information about mobile apps in audiology �  The \nrole that both AI and mobile apps have in our lives is \ngrowing rapidly, as it is in healthcare, but at the same \ntime there is a great need to verify that the underlying \ntechnology is trustworthy �  Some recent investigations \non chatbots in audiology have highlighted problems \nwith accuracy of information [1,2] as well as the high variability of the responses provided [3] � \nSuch problems loom even larger because chatbots usually fail to provide sources of information, \nand even if specifically asked to provide them will often give incorrect or fabricated sources [4] � \nClearly, this whole field needs much more scrutiny before it can be adopted more widely �\nNext in the issue is a review paper on regeneration of cochlear hair cell based on stem cell therapy � \nIt reviews a promising areas of auditory research: the potential for stem cell-based therapies to \naddress sensorineural hearing loss � This is followed by a paper on wideband absorbance patterns \nin cases of tympanic membrane perforation and another on the effectiveness of bilateral fitting \nof the Adhear bone conduction device �\nThis issue also includes a conference report about the Hearing Across the Lifespan (HeAL) \nmeeting held in Cernobbio, Lake Como, earlier this year �\nFinally, there are abstracts from two highly anticipated conferences in Warsaw – first the 7th International \nConference on Hyperacusis and Misophonia, and second the 59th Inner Ear Biology Workshop �  Many \nof us here are looking forward to learning much from these meetings �\nWith kind regards and greetings,\nProf. Henryk Skarzynski, M.D., Ph.D., Dr. h.c. multi\nVolume 14 ▪ Number 3 ▪ September 2024\n 1�  J edrzejczak WW , Kochanek K �  Comparison of the audiological knowledge of three chatbots: ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard �  Audiol \nNeurootol, 2024: 1–7 � doi:10 �1159/000538983\n 2� J edrzejczak WW , Skarzynski PH, Raj-Koziak D, Sanfins MD, Hatzopoulos S, Kochanek K � C hatGPT for tinnitus information and support: \nresponse accuracy and retest after three and six months � Brain Sci, 2024; 14: 465 � doi:10 �3390/brainsci14050465\n 3� K ochanek K, Skarzynski H, Jedrzejczak WW �  Accuracy and repeatability of ChatGPT based on a set of multiple-choice questions on \nobjective tests of hearing �  Cureus, 2024 �  doi:10 � 7759/cureus � 59857\n 4�  J ędrzejczak WW , Pastucha M, Skarżyński H, Kochanek K �  Comparison of ChatGPT and Gemini as sources of references in \notorhinolaryngology �  MedRxiv 2024 �  doi:10 � 1101/2024 � 08 � 12 � 24311896References"

      "text": "DO CHATBOTS PROVIDE RELIABLE \nINFORMATION ABOUT MOBILE APPS \nIN AUDIOLOGY?\nMałgorzata Pastucha1A-F\nInstitute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing, World Hearing Center, Department of \nExperimental Audiology, Warsaw/Kajetany, Poland\nCorresponding author: Małgorzata Pastucha, Department of Experimental \nAudiology, Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing, ul �  Mokra 17, Kajetany, \n05-830 Nadarzyn, Poland; email: m �pastucha@ifps �org� pl\nAbstract\nIntroduction: In light of the growing interest in utilizing AI for information retrieval, assessing the accuracy and reliability of tools such as \nchatbots is essential. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of chatbots in providing accurate information about mobile applications (apps) \nin the field of audiology.\nMaterial and methods: The responses of the Gemini and ChatGPT chatbots to eight open-ended questions posed in Polish and English were \ncompared. Each answer was assessed for correctness.\nResults: Gemini_ENG achieved the highest correctness with a score of 5 points (62.5%), while ChatGPT_PL scored 2 points (25%), and both \nGemini_PL and ChatGPT_ENG scored 1 point (12.5%). Chatbots were most effective in recommending apps for older adults, with three of \nthe four chatbots providing accurate recommendations. However, they struggled when asked to recommend apps for non-English speakers, to describe apps, or to provide direct links, with none of them scoring points in these areas.\nConclusions: Chatbots are currently unreliable sources of information about audiology apps. Depending on the language, there is significant \nvariability in response accuracy. A good example is that Gemini_ENG performed far better than Gemini_PL. A major issue for all of them was the frequent fabrication of data, including the creation of nonexistent app names and incorrect links.\nKeywords: ChatGPT • Gemini • mobile apps • hearing test • Polish • English\nCZY CHATBOTY MOGĄ DOSTARCZAĆ WIARYGODNYCH INFORMACJI \nO APLIKACJACH MOBILNYCH W AUDIOLOGII?\nStreszczenie\nWprowadzenie: W świetle rosnącego zainteresowania wykorzystaniem sztucznej inteligencji do wyszukiwania informacji ocena dokładności \ni niezawodności narzędzi takich jak chatboty jest niezbędna. Niniejsze badanie ma na celu ocenę skuteczności chatbotów w dostarczaniu \ndokładnych informacji o aplikacjach mobilnych w dziedzinie audiologii.\nMateriał i metody: Porównano odpowiedzi chatbotów Gemini i ChatGPT na osiem pytań otwartych zadanych w języku polskim i angielskim. \nKażda odpowiedź była oceniana pod kątem poprawności.\nWyniki: Gemini_ENG osiągnął najwyższą poprawność z wynikiem 5 punktów (62,5%), podczas gdy ChatGPT_PL uzyskał 2 punkty (25%), \na zarówno Gemini_PL, jak i ChatGPT_ENG uzyskały 1 punkt (12,5%). Chatboty były najbardziej skuteczne w polecaniu aplikacji dla osób \nstarszych, przy czym trzy z czterech chatbotów zapewniały dokładne rekomendacje. Miały one jednak trudności, gdy poproszono je o polecanie \naplikacji dla osób nieanglojęzycznych, opisywanie aplikacji lub dostarczanie bezpośrednich linków, przy czym żaden z nich nie zdobył punktów \nw tych obszarach.Wnioski: Chatboty są obecnie niewiarygodnym źródłem informacji o aplikacjach audiologicznych. W zależności od języka istnieje znaczna \nzmienność w dokładności odpowiedzi. Dobrym przykładem jest to, że Gemini_ENG działał znacznie lepiej niż Gemini_PL. Głównym \nproblemem dla wszystkich z nich była częsta fabrykacja danych, w tym tworzenie nieistniejących nazw aplikacji i nieprawidłowych linków.Słowa kluczowe: ChatGPT • Gemini • aplikacje mobilne • badanie słuchu • polski • angielski\n9ISSN: 2083-389X\neISSN: 2084-3127J Hear Sci, 2024; 14(3): 9–15\nDOI: 10.17430/jhs/192556\nCC BY-NC-ND 3.0 PL, © The Authors\nContributions:\nA Study design/planning\nB Data collection/entry\nC D ata analysis/statistics\nD Data interpretation\nE P reparation of manuscript\nF Literature analysis/search\nG Funds collection"

      "text": "Introduction\nChatbots, advanced conversational tools based on artifi -\ncial intelligence (AI), are able to conduct natural language \ndialogues [1] � Following an initial training phase on large \ndata sets, they generate responses to queries based on a \nwide range of information available on the internet � Due \nto their potential applications in science and medicine [2], \nchatbots are gaining widespread interest, with researchers \ntesting them in various health sectors [3–5] �\nAnother example of rapidly developing technology in \nhealthcare is mobile apps [6,7] � In the field of audiology, \nrapid technology development has led to the marketing of \na number of apps for testing hearing [8] � The apps have \ngood sensitivity and specificity, and a number of studies \nhave demonstrated they have potential for screening pur -\nposes [9–11] � However, the plethora of apps can make it \ndifficult for a user to choose the most appropriate one � \nPatients may therefore seek sources of information in this \narea� One source of information might include a chatbot, \nwhich might appeal to a patient who, for various reasons, \nmay find it difficult to access a specialist [12] � However, \nthe extent to which chatbots can provide relevant informa-\ntion about mobile apps in the field of hearing is unknown �\nTo date, there have been few studies in the field of audi -\nology on the use of chatbots � Existing works have main -\nly concerned the extent to which AI can handle special -\nized questions in audiology [13–16] � The answers vary \ndepending on the version of the chatbot used [14] and \nmay change over time [13,15] � In addition, the accuracy \nof the answers can be affected by the form of the ques -\ntion asked, e � g�  whether it is an open-ended question [13] \nor multiple-choice [15] � Moreover, the responses generat -\ned by chatbots can differ depending on the language used \nin the query, as different databases will be searched [17] �\nIn summary, the efficacy of chatbots in providing correct \naudiological information is unknown � To date, no research \nhas yet been done to verify the accuracy of information provided by chatbots about mobile apps for testing hear -\ning� The objective of this study is therefore to test whether \ncommon chatbots are able to supply reliable information about mobile apps for testing hearing �  Two types of chat -\nbots were selected, and each was asked questions in two \nlanguages, English and Polish � The accuracy, correctness, \nand usefulness of the answers were assessed �\nMaterial and methods\nTwo types of free chatbots – ChatGPT version 4o, \n(OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) and Gemini (Google \nLLC, Mountain View, CA, USA) – were selected for study �  \nQuestions were asked in July 2024 in English and Polish, \nresulting in four versions for analysis: ChatGPT_ENG, \nChatGPT_PL, Gemini_ENG, and Gemini_PL �\nEight open-ended questions related to hearing test apps \nwere formulated ( Table 1 )� These questions were based on \ninformation that could be verified with reference to spe -\ncific studies [8,18] or by searching the mobile app market \n(e�g� , Google Play Store, App Store) �  After asking questions \nof the chatbots, their answers were saved and analyzed \nfor accuracy �  It was checked whether the identified apps \nexisted (questions 1–5), whether their descriptions were correct (question 6), and which apps the chatbot recom -\nmended (questions 7 and 8) �\nThe responses to questions 1–4 were analyzed in terms of both the number of total answers provided and the num -\nber of correct answers � An answer was considered cor -\nrect if the listed app was available on at least one platform (Google Play Store or App Store) and allowed a hearing \ntest to be done �\nFor question 5, it was examined whether the chatbots pro -\nvided a link to a specific app, and if so, whether the link \nwas correct �\nFor question 6, the evaluation was in terms of:\n–  a pp description (accuracy, completeness, incorrect \ninformation);\n–  u ser rating (quantitative/qualitative; if quantitative, \nwhether it matched the ratings given on the platform \nwhere the app is available),\n–  a pp availability on platforms (correct indication of avail -\nability on one or both platforms) �\nNo. Questions\n1 What mobile apps for testing hearing are currently available?\n2 Are these apps available in Poland?\n3 Are there mobile hearing test apps for children?\n4 Are there any mobile hearing test apps specifically designed for children to perform so-called “play audiometry”?\n5 Can you provide a link to these apps?\n6Can you point to specific examples of hearing testing apps with their description, including features, user ratings, and \nthe platforms on which they are available?\n7Which mobile hearing test app would you recommend for a person who has manual dexterity difficulties, is unfamiliar with smartphones, or has increased reaction time? Explain your choice.\n8 Can you recommend an app available in Polish for non-English speakers?Table 1.

they form later in embryonic development, \nand are more easily damaged than IHCs � IHCs are less \nnumerous (3500 of them); they develop earlier and are \nmore resilient [2] �\nMost cases of hearing impairment are due to the degener -\nation of cHCs � Damage to these cells is mainly induced by \nage, anoxia at birth, infection, exposure to ototoxic drugs \n(e�g� antibiotics, some anti-cancer drugs), genetic mutations, \nand exposure to high-intensity sounds � Hearing deficits may \nalso result from damage to the neurons of the spiral gangli -\non that innervate the cHCs [3] � Regeneration of cHCs af -\nter damage occurs spontaneously in non-mammalian verte -\nbrates like birds and fish but not in the mammalian cochlea, \nmeaning that in mammals hearing loss is permanent [4] �\nTherapeutically, a range of hearing support technologies \nexist, such as hearing aids and implantable medical devic -\nes� However, in aiming to restore hearing, remarkable ad -\nvances have led to other innovative therapies [5] � For coch -\nlear implants (CIs) to be successful and effective, afferent \nneurons must be functional [6]; if they are not, CIs may \nbe contraindicated, even if conventional hearing aids fail \nto provide any benefit � The search for new solutions has \nled to stem-cell therapy (SC) [7] � Continued research into \nthe regeneration of cHCs suggests that future treatment of \nsensorineural hearing loss may involve a combination of \ngene therapy, cell therapy, molecular therapy, and CIs [8] �\nIt is now possible to convert differentiated somatic cells \ninto multipotent SCs that have the capacity to generate all \nadult cell types; this technique is called induced pluripotent stem cells � Thus, there is a wide variety of applications for \nthis technology, including regenerative medicine, in vit -\nro disease modeling, and drug screening/discovery [9] �\nAccording to Diensthuber and Stöver, and as shown in \nFigure 1, cochlear or inner ear hair cell regeneration en -\ncompasses cell therapy, gene therapy, and pharmacologi -\ncal and molecular therapy [2,10] �\nStem cell-based hair cell regeneration\nThe inability of mammals to regenerate their hearing or -\ngan after damage is due to the postnatal decrease in SCs \nin the inner ear [11,12] � Generally speaking, there are two \nmodels for studying hair cell regeneration in mammals, \nnamely cochlear organoids and cochlear organs � Hair cells \nwithin the organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells, \nor from a cochlear progenitor, share similar structural \nand functional properties to native hair cells � The inner \near and cochlear organoids can be derived from induced \npluripotent SCs [13] � Induced pluripotent SCs are gener -\nated via genetic reprogramming of adult somatic cells that \nhave limited differentiation potential but, upon reprogram-\nming, express genes that enable them to regain plasticity \nand give rise to all cell types [14–16] �\nPrevious studies have described SC therapy in which cells are transplanted into the inner ear to replace injured or \ndead cHCs [17–19] � To develop successful regenerative \napproaches for hearing loss, there must be a detailed un -\nderstanding of the human inner ear, specifically its func -\ntion, differentiation, and cellular mechanisms � There are \ncurrently several ongoing early-stage studies into the \n regeneration of cHCs �\nTechniques that use SCs as a basis for cHC regeneration \ncould play a key role in hearing restoration [5,10] � There \nare a large number of possible sources for obtaining SCs \nfor hearing therapy, including: embryonic SCs, induced \npluripotent SCs, mesenchymal SCs, neural SCs, and in-\nner ear SCs � It is concluded that SC-based therapy looks \nespecially promising for re-establishing hearing function \n[20–22] � There are two possible SC-based approaches to \ntreating deafness [3,21–23]: \n–  en dogenous regeneration or the restoration of existing \nHCs in the inner ear by inducing changes at the cell  c ycle \nlevel (administration of cell survival factors and other biologically active molecules), stimulating resident SCs \nwithin the organ of Corti to replace their own damaged \ncHCs;Regeneration of inner hair cells\nGene therap y Cell therapy Pharmacological\nand molecular\ntherapy\nFigure 1.

      "text": "Introduction\nThe primary function of tympanic membrane (TM) is to \ntransmit sound waves effectively from the external audi -\ntory canal through the ossicular chain to the oval window \nand inner ear �  This crucial process relies on the vibrato -\nry nature of the TM, i � e� , it converts the ear canal’s sound \npressure to the ossicles’ vibrations [1] � The TM can be di -\nvided into four quadrants: anterosuperior, anteroinferi -\nor, posteroinferior, and posterosuperior [2] � Studies have \nshown that the TM exhibits frequency-specific transmis -\nsion, indicating its importance in sound transduction [3,4] � \nHowever, depending on their location and extent, tympan-\nic membrane perforation (TMP) can have varying effects \non sound transmission �\nTMP can be classified according to the perforation site, \nwhether on the pars tensa or pars flaccida � Central TMP \nmay involve different quadrants of the TM, with anterior \nquadrant TMP extending from the anterior to the malleus \nhandle, and posterior quadrant TMP extending from the \nposterior to the handle of the malleus � Marginal TMP in -\nvolves a lack of TM borders in specific segments [5] and \nthe location of the perforation can alter frequency-specif -\nic sound transmission to the ossicles �\nAlthough single-frequency tympanometry with a 226-Hz \nprobe tone is a commonly used diagnostic tool for evalu -\nating the middle ear system, some studies have reported \nlow accuracy in identifying middle ear pathologies [6,7] � \nThis is because middle ear disorders produce a significant \nchange in middle ear structures, including the ossicular \nmass, stiffness of the TM, and supporting structures, which \nleads to frequency-specific attenuation or filtering [8] � To \novercome these limitations, multi-frequency tympanom -\netry is used, which is superior to standard 226 Hz tym -\npanometry �  However, it has limitations, such as standing \nwaves above 1500 Hz, which result in significant differ -\nences in sound pressure levels within the ear canal and, \nthus, can interfere with accurate readings at high frequen -\ncies [9,10] � To address these challenges, wideband tympa -\nnometry (WBT) emerged as an alternative tool to assess \nthe middle ear system �\nWBT measures the amount of sound energy absorbed or \nreflected by the ear �  A controlled range of sounds is in -\ntroduced into the ear canal, and then an analysis is per -\nformed on how much of that energy is absorbed or reflect -\ned by the eardrum at each frequency �  This information \nprovides insights into the functioning and characteristics \nof the middle ear [11,12] �\nThe impact of TMP on wideband absorbance (WBA) meas -\nures on middle ear transmission has been discussed in sev -\neral studies [13–18] � Karuppannan and Barman (2021) [15] and Karuppannan et al �  (2024) [19] found lower absorb -\nance values in low and mid frequencies, with higher ab-\nsorbance observed beyond 4000 Hz under peak pressure \nconditions for individuals with TMP �  Similarly, Kim et al �  \n(2019) [17] conducted WBA on individuals with TMP and \nnoted lower absorbance at low frequencies and higher ab -\nsorbance at high frequencies � However, inconsistencies in \nthe literature have been reported, with some studies [20,21] \nindicating higher absorbance at low frequencies in indi -\nviduals with TMP �  Overall, no consensus exists regarding \nfrequencies with highly variable energy absorbance pat -\nterns reported in individuals with TMP �\nThis variability in absorbance patterns may be attributed \nto the inclusion of different types and locations of TMP �  \nEven though some studies have shown that the size of the \nTMP has more of an impact on transmission than its loca -\ntion [22], the fact is that the location of a TMP significant -\nly alters frequency-specific sound transmission [23,24] � It \nis therefore essential to study the effect of the location of \nTMP on WBA � However, no studies have compared WBA \nacross different quadrants of the TMP , which is a research \ngap� Thus, the current study investigated the effect of the \ntwo types of TMP on WBA measures � The objectives were \nto compare, against normal ears with intact TM and un -\nder different pressure conditions, WBA across frequencies \nfor the two TMP types �\nMaterial and methods\nParticipants\nThree groups of participants, aged between 18 and 60 \nyears (mean age 35 �2 years; SD = 9�7 years), were recruited \nfor the study �  Group I comprised individuals with central \nTMP (mean age, 36 �3 years; SD = 6�7 years) ( n = 65 ears); \nGroup II included participants with marginal TMP (mean \nage, 32 �6  years; SD = 4�5  years) ( n = 1 3 ears), and Group III \nwas the normal ear group, consisting of individuals with \nintact TM and normal hearing sensitivity (mean age 31 �2 \nyears; SD = 2�5 years) ( n = 20 ears) �\nThe study obtained ethical approval from the Ethical \nCommittee for Bio-Behavioural Research Involving \nHuman Subjects at the All India Institute of Speech and \nHearing (approval no �  WOF-0404) and adhered to the \nethical principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration \n(2013) for medical research involving human subjects � \nThe study’s objectives and procedures were explained in detail to each participant, and written informed consent \nwas obtained for their voluntary participation before en -\nrolment in the study �\nCriteria for inclusion\nThe normal ear group (Group III) had air conduction hear -\ning thresholds of ≤  15 dB HL in t he octave frequencies be -\ntween 250 and 8000 Hz, an air-bone gap of ≤  10 dB HL, \nspeech identification scores of >  9 0%, and uncomforta -\nble loudness level (UCL) of >  90 dB HL �  All participants \nexhibited normal middle ear, as confirmed by single fre -\nquency immittance findings showing an “ A/As” type tym -\npanogram with both ipsi- and contralateral reflexes pre -\nsent between 90 and 100 dB HL, along with the presence WBT wideband tympanometry\nWBA wideband absorbance\nTM tympanic membrane\nTMP tympanic membrane perforationKey for abbreviations\nOriginal articles • 39–47\n40\n Journal of Hearing Science  ·  2 024 Vol. 14  ·  N o. 3"

both lead to impedance \nmismatch and reflection of sound energy �  Between 1000 \nand 3000 Hz, the stiffness and mass components cancel, \nallowing energy to pass into the middle ear [20] �\nFor both pressure conditions, the central TMP group \n exhibited lower absorbance values at low and mid-  \n-frequencies, with medium values around 2500 Hz and \nhigher absorbance beyond 3000 Hz compared with the \nnormal TM group �  These findings are consistent with pre -\nvious studies [15,17,19], which reported reduced absorb -\nance values in the low and mid-frequency range for ears \nwith TMP � Thi s decreased absorbance may be attribut -\ned to the lower ratio of the affected eardrum area to the \noval window area and to the buckling effect � Tonndorf \nand Khanna’s (1972) classic study on frequency-specific \nvibration of the TM [3] revealed that the membrane vi-brated cohesively at lower frequencies but that TMP dis -\nrupts this normal vibratory pattern, necessitating a larg -\ner area for low frequencies � This requirement could lead \nto decreased absorbance, potentially reduced absorbance \nat low frequencies �\nContradictory results are also apparent and documented in \nthe literature, with studies reporting increased absorbance \nat low and mid frequencies in ears with TMP in compari-\nson to individuals with intact TM [20,21,27] � Previous au -\nthors with contradictory findings to those displayed here have attributed this phenomenon to an increase in mass \nwithin the middle ear caused by TMP , which allows low-\nfrequency energy to easily enter the middle ear [26] � At \nhigher frequencies, there are some inconsistencies between \nour work and that of previous authors, with some studies \nreporting normal or near-normal absorbance [27,28] al -\nthough others, consistent with the current work, see in -\ncreased absorbance at higher frequencies [15,20,29] � One \nanimal study has found reduced absorbance at higher fre -\nquencies [24] � The increased absorbance measured in the \ncurrent study at higher frequencies can be ascribed to \nshorter wavelengths easily passing through large TMPs �\nTo our knowledge, no studies have measured WBA in in-\ndividuals with marginal TMPs � The present study revealed \nthey had similar absorbance to the normal ear group up to about 500 Hz, low absorbance at mid-frequencies up \nto 3000 Hz, and higher absorbance at frequencies above \n4000 Hz � The WBA pattern of the marginal TMP group \ndisplayed three peaks at 600, 4000, and 6000 Hz, together \nwith a dip at 2000 Hz � The rationale behind this can be un -\nderstood by examining the physiology of sound transmis -\nsion through the TM � M ost participants had marginal TMP \nin the posterior quadrant � Since the resonant frequen -\ncy of the posterior quadrant of the TM is approximately \n2000 Hz [3], damage to this quadrant can lead to a reduc -\ntion in sound transmission at 2000 Hz and give a signifi -\ncant decrease in absorbance �  Most of the TM responsible \nfor low-frequency transmission remains intact, perhaps \naccounting for an absorbance pattern similar to that of \nOriginal articles • 39–47\n42\n Journal of Hearing Science  ·  2 024 Vol. 14  ·  N o. 3"

By way of contrast, a non-surgical hearing system – Adhear (Med-El, Innsbruck, Austria) – allows the sound processor to be attached \nusing a noninvasive adhesive adapter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Adhear system and assess its subjective \nbenefits in a child who had bilateral conductive hearing loss.\nCase report: The Adhear system was tested in a 13-year-old child with bilateral conductive hearing loss. Pure tone audiometry and speech \naudiometry in quiet were performed without and then with a pair of devices placed bilaterally. Word recognition scores (WRS) at 50 and \n65 dB SPL in quiet were measured using the Pruszewicz monosyllabic Polish word test. After 4 weeks, subjective hearing benefit and experience \nwith the Adhear system was done using the APHAB ( Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit) questionnaire.\nResults: With Adhear, WRS at 50  dB S PL increased significantly from an unaided score of 10%  t o 80%.

      "text": "Introduction\nEarly identification of hearing loss and ear diseases is key �  \nAccording to hearing aid guidelines, a child with hearing \nimpairment should be diagnosed before 3 months of age \nand fitted with a hearing aid before 6 months [1] � The se -\nlection and fitting of hearing aids for young patients is a \ncomplex diagnostic process that requires the cooperation \nof specialists in various areas [2,3] � The most important \nelement in the selection of hearing aids is proper fitting \nand assessing the device’s effectiveness �\nNot all patients can be compensated for their hearing loss \nwith classic air-conduction hearing aids � Th ey include \nthose with defects in the outer or middle ear, chronic otitis, \nor other inflammatory conditions � T ypically, these subjects \nwill have conductive or mixed hearing loss and require \nthe use of bone conduction to allow the external sound \nto reach the inner ear directly, in this way bypassing dam -\naged structures at the level of the outer and/or middle ear �\nBone conduction involves the transmission of sound \nthrough the bones of the skull to the inner ear � A  bone \nconduction hearing aid changes the captured sound signal \ninto vibrations of the bones of the skull, stimulating the \nfluids in the inner ear directly [4] � Unlike the many dif -\nferent models of classic hearing aids, there are only a few \nbone conduction devices available �  They can be mounted \non the patient’s head using soft bands or eyeglass frames � \nThese solutions are often not well accepted by children with \nconductive hearing loss because of head pressure, skin ir -\nritation, sweating, discomfort during long use, poor sound \nquality, or cosmetic stigma [5,6] �Another solution for patients with conductive hearing loss \nis a non-surgical hearing system, Adhear �  The Adhear sys -\ntem (Med-El, Innsbruck, Austria) is a nonsurgical bone \nconduction hearing aid, available since 2017, which uses an adhesive patch to connect the sound processor to the \nskull �  The device has a symmetrical design so it can be \nused on either ear � I t is intended for patients with con -\nductive hearing loss or unilateral deafness, either tempo-\nrary or permanent � There are no age restrictions to us -\ning the device, and it is suitable for children as young as \na few months � The Adhear system consists of a bone con -\nduction audio processor that is held in place with an ad -\nhesive adapter placed over the mastoid behind the auricle \n(Figure 1 )� An integrated transducer in the sound proces -\nsor converts sound into mechanical vibrations, which are carried by the adhesive adapter and transmitted through \nthe skin to the mastoid and then directly to the inner ear �\nThe audio processor has dual microphones and is powered \nby a single P13 battery �  A button allows the user to switch \nbetween programs, the number depending on the age and \nexpectations of the user �  There is a volume control, which \ncan be turned off for the youngest users � The signal pro -\ncessor uses an automatic classifier to control the adaptive \ndirectional microphone system and suppress feedback � Th e \nproprietary adhesive adapter uses a non-toxic, non-aller -\ngenic medical adhesive tape to attach the adapter to the \nskin and provide good sound quality without pressure on \nthe head or skin � It is water resistant and breathable, and \ncan be used continuously for 3–7 days [7,8] � In compar -\nison, bone conduction hearing aids on soft bands are of -\nten not well accepted by children because of head pres-\nsure, sweating, or visual stigma � The lack of a headband \nmakes the system less conspicuous and more comfortable �\nFigure 1.

These devices are in -\ndicated in patients with stable bone conduction hearing \nthresholds within the recommended manufacturer’s range � \nBone conduction implants are a solution for patients over \n5 years old [11] � Bilateral bone conduction fitting was \nsuccessfully done and audiological benefits and patient  \nsatisfaction were shown [11] �\nFor patients for whom previous surgical procedures have not given adequate benefits and for whom classic hearing \naids cannot be used (or for various reasons decide against \nimplantable solutions), bone conduction hearing aids are \nthe only option to improve hearing �\nFor both non-invasive and implantable devices, research \nhas emphasized the importance of early auditory rehabili -\ntation for normal age-appropriate quality of life �  Each case \nneeds to be analyzed individually, looking at audiologi -\ncal aspects as well as the patient’s subjective assessment � \nThe emotional and behavioral difficulties involving chil -\ndren and adolescents with mild to profound hearing loss \nare primarily linked to concerns about relationships with \npeers � In this context, language and communication are \nimportant for the psychosocial development of children, \nas they are the main means of establishing and maintain -\ning social interactions [12] �\nThis paper presents a case report � Due to the specificity of \nthe disorder, it is difficult to collect large material, and at present only a few papers have been published showing \nthe bilateral use of the Adhear system in children � There \nis a need for more detailed research in this area � The pur -\npose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy \nof bilateral fitting of the non-invasive Adhear bone con -\nduction device in a child with conductive hearing loss �\nCase report\nThis case concerns a 13-year-old female with bilateral con -\nductive hearing loss due to congenital defect of the mid-\ndle ears (Figure 1 )� The patient had used bilateral hear -\ning aids � She had a history of chronic middle ear disease \nand interventions including ventilation tubes, but with no \nimprovement in hearing �  Due to chronic inflammation, \nthe child could not use conventional hearing aids during treatment � Attempts were made to use bone conduction \nhearing aids on a soft band, but these were rejected due \nto the child’s discomfort and reluctance �  Due to deformi -\nty of the auricles, the parents are considering reconstruc-\ntion and they do not want an implantable solution at this \nstage �  After reviewing various bone conduction hear -\ning aids, and based on audiometry and medical history,  \nthe Adhear system was selected bilaterally �\nMethods\nHearing tests for air and bone conduction were done � \nAfter the bone conduction devices were selected and set \nup, sound field thresholds and a word recognition test with \nand without the device were done �  Sound field thresh -\nolds with the devices on both sides were measured using \nwarble tones at 0 �25, 0 �5, 1, 2, 3, and 4   kH z with loud -\nspeakers placed 1 m in front of the patient � Word recog -\nnition scores at 50 and 65 dB SPL in quiet were measured with speech coming from the front using the Pruszewicz \n monosyllabic Polish word test � Subjective evaluation of \nbenefits from the Adhear were assessed using the APHAB \nquestionnaire ( Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit )� \nAPHAB comprises 24 questions about auditory functioning \ngrouped into four categories: EC ( Ease of Communication); \nBN ( Background Noise ); RV (Reverberation ); and AV \n(Aversiveness )� The patient completed the questionnaire \nbefore the devices were fitted and again one month after \nthe Adhear system was fitted �\nResults\nResults of pure tone audiometry, free-field audiometry, \nand speech audiometry in quiet are shown in Figures 2, \n3, and 4� The result of free-field audiometry with Adhear \non both sides indicated a hearing level within the normal range, with results better than 25 dB HL ( Figure 3\n)� With \nAdhear in place, WRS at 50 dB SPL increased significantly \nfrom an unaided score of 10%   t o 80% ( Figure 4 )�\nThe results of the APHAB questionnaire confirm the ben -\nefits of the Adhear system ( Figure 5 )� The most significant \nbenefit was in the category of speech understanding in dif -\nficult acoustic conditions (RV), a factor that is particular -\nly important for children � The AV scores were higher with \nthe device, probably because the child needed more than \na month to adapt to the new sounds � Adaptation time is \nindividual and can take several months �\nDiscussion\nThe audiological performance of the new device benefits \nfrom the low weight of the adhesive adapter, improved \nmechanical transmission, and, compared to a  s oftband, \na better position for stimulation close to the ear canal [13] � \nIn 2019, Neumann and colleagues presented the first \nstudy evaluating the audiological and clinical outcomes \nof Adhear [14], where, in short- and mid-term follow-\nups in children under 10 years of age, it was compared \nwith conventional bone conduction devices integrated in \nsoftbands � The comparisons established that sound field \nthresholds (in quiet and noise) and WRSs were statistical -\nly indistinguishable between the devices � However, com -\npared to the softband users, the Adhear children achieved \nCywka and Skarzynski – Effectiveness of Adhear bilaterally\n53 Journal of Hearing Science  ·  2 024 Vol. 14  ·  N o. 3"

inner ear, \nsegregating the cochlea, the organ of Corti, and five vestib -\nular endorgans � Evolution transforms the basilar papilla in \nsarcopterygians into the cochlea in mammals � However, the \nrole of genes driving the ear development is largely unknown �Material and methods: We used double null mice for Iroquois \nhomeobox 3 (Irx3) and 5 (Irx5) transcription factors (Irx3/5 \nDKO) � Mice can survive to about E16 �5, after that they occa -\nsionally can reach at E17 �5�\nResults: We show that double deletion of (Irx3/5 DKO) mice \nleads to the fusion of the saccule with the cochlear base �  The \nmedial rows of cochlear HCs in the expanded sensory epi-\nthelium assumed vestibular-like hair cells near the modio -\nlus while others seem like cochlear hair cells � The otoconia \nand tectorial membranes are needed for normal function but \nare absent in the Irx3/5 DKO inner ear �  The mutant cochlea \nshowed a reduced spiral ganglion neuron population, which \nprojects fibers to both saccular- and cochlear-like HCs � The \ncentral projections from the cochlear apex-base contour are not fully segregated into a dorsal and ventral innervation in \nthe Irx3/5 DKO cochlear nucleus � An expansion of the cochle -\nar dorsal nuclei in the brainstem reaches vestibular fiber con -\nnections only in the Irx3/5 DKO �  Additionally, the auditory \nand vestibular systems in Irx3/5 DKO mice are interconnect -\ned, characterized by the formation of bilateral connections between the descending vestibular and ascending apex that \nalso demonstrates a unique interconnectedness between

\n(CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland\nIntroduction: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a precise, \nsingle-session irradiation technique commonly used to treat \nvestibular schwannomas � However, SRS can lead to irrevers -\nible hearing loss, most probably due to irradiation-induced \ndamage to the nearby inner ear �  Currently, no preventive or \ntherapeutic options exist, highlighting the need for the de -\nvelopment and experimental testing of novel treatments � To \nenable this research, we developed a protocol for inducing \nunilateral hearing loss in mice through targeted unilateral \ncochlear irradiation �\nMaterial and methods: We used 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice and administered precise unilateral irradiation in the vicin-\nity of the cochlea using a Leksell Gamma Knife ® Icon de -\nvice�  The precision and reproducibility of the targeted area \nwere ensured through radiological imaging for each mouse using the integrated cone beam CT scan and co-registering \nthese images with MRI and CT mouse atlas images � To en -\nsure meaningful translational data, we placed a single 4 mm \nisocenter lateral to the cochlea with the 80% isodose line \npassing through the modiolus to deliver 8 ( n = 3), 16 ( n = 5), \n24 (n  = 8), a nd 32 ( n = 8) G y �  Auditory brainstem responses \n(ABR) were measured one day prior to irradiation (baseline) \nand at one and four weeks post-irradiation � Statistical analy -\nsis was performed using two-way repeated measures ANOV A \nwith Bonferroni correction �\nResults: In all experimental groups, the irradiation dose re -\nceived by the non-irradiated cochlea was less than 15% of that \nreceived by the irradiated cochlea � In the 32 Gy group, irra -\ndiation of cochlea yielded significant threshold shifts, com -\npared to the non-irradiated ear, at 22 �6 and 32 kHz on day 7 \nand to a greater degree on day 28 � S imilar but less pronounced \neffects were observed in the 24 Gy group �  Furthermore, we \nobserved a

become \nincreasingly valuable in cochlear implant (CI) surgery as it \nallows intraoperative monitoring of effects of electrode ar -\nray insertion on residual hair cell function � Additionally, \nECochG has the potential to portray postoperative cochle -\nar function � Here we examine the postoperative time course \nof residual hair cell function by recording ECochG in CI re-cipients intraoperatively and at several time points up to one \nyear postoperatively �\nMaterial and methods: Twenty-three patients with severe \nsensorineural hearing loss receiving a CI participated in a \ntrial comparing electrode arrays (SlimJ and Mid-Scala of \nAdvanced Bionics) and surgical approaches (Jwair et al � , \n2021) � Here, the data are analysed by investigators blinded \nto the randomisation � ECochG recordings were performed \nat 5 time points using the active insertion monitoring (AIM) system of Advanced Bionics: intraoperatively, at 4–6 weeks, \n3–4 months, 6–7 months and 12–14 months postoperative-\nly� Responses to pure-tone stimuli with frequencies varying \nfrom 125 to 4000 Hz, at sound levels 100–115 dB HL, were \nrecorded at each of the 16 available electrodes, in two oppo-\nsite phases � The difference and sum of the recordings to the \nopposite phases were computed as estimates of cochlear mi -\ncrophonics (CM, reflecting hair cell potentials) and audito-\nry nerve responses, respectively �\nResults: Significant CM responses (>1 �5 µV) were found in \n12 out of 22 patients intraoperatively, and postoperative -\nly in 10/22 at 4–6 weeks, 12/16 at 3–4 months, 11/16 at 6–7 \nmonths, and 7/11 at 12–14 months � Notably, 7 intraopera -\ntive non-responders showed significant responses in the first \npostoperative session � Averaged across frequencies the larg -\nest responses were observed recorded at the apical electrodes \nduring the intraoperative session � The responses were small -\nest at 4–6 weeks postoperatively, then recovered after 3 to 7 \nmonths, and decreased again up to one year after implanta -\ntion� Intraoperatively, the dominant frequency was 500 Hz, \npostoperatively it was 125 Hz �\nConclusions: Residual hair cell function gradually declines \nover the course of one year �  Three months after cochlear im -\nplantation a short period of recovery is seen, which may be attributed to natural reduction of the

University, Nanjing, China\nGenetic mutations can cause hereditary deafness, among \nwhich DFNA15 caused by mutations in the transcription \nfactor POU4F3 is a clinically common autosomal dominant \nnon-syndromic deafness, and studies have been conduct -\ned to partially restore hearing in model mice by small mol -\necule inhibitors � However, this strategy fails to address the \nroot cause of hearing impairment � Base editors are capable \nof editing mutation sites precisely and efficiently, and have \nthe potential to completely restore hearing damage �  In or -\nder to verify the effectiveness of gene editing for the treat -\nment of this deafness disease, taking the Chinese DFNA15 \n(POU4F3Q113*) deaf family line as an example, we success -\nfully constructed the Pou4f3Q113*/+ mouse model with the \nprogressive hearing damage of this type of patients, which \nprovides a good animal model for the study of this type of \ngenetic deafness disease �  On the basis of the three highly ef -\nficient Cas9 types discovered in the laboratory in the previ -\nous stage, a series of novel ABE toolboxes were developed \nthrough the fusion of multiple types of TadA deaminases � \nThe test screened SchABE8e base editor in vitro can realize \nprecise and efficient editing at the pathogenic mutation (up \nto 50% efficiency) � Compared with ABE8e, SchABE8e has \nhigher editing efficiency and lower off-target mutations and \nindels, which is safer and more precise �  Subsequently, by an -\nalyzing the secondary structure of SchABE8e protein, the op -\ntimal splitting site 4 was screened to achieve similar protein \nexpression as WT SchABE8e in the HEK293T cell �  Delivery \nof split SchABE8e/NNGR-Target3 into the cochlea of neo -\nnatal mice by double

stereocilia fusion by studying mouse models of age-\ning, prolonged noise-exposure, and cell-intrinsic stress caused \nby genetic perturbations � We utilised a novel imaging meth -\nod to cochlear research, expansion microscopy, to generate \nsuper-resolution data of the OHC hair bundle structure and \nprotein expression � Ageing in the C57BL/6J mice exhibited \nmild OHC stereocilia fusion, in most cases restricted to the \nlateral edges of hair bundles, indicating gradual progression \nof the fusion pathology �  OHCs of young adult C57BL/6J mice \nexhibited elevated likelihood of

“gut–  micr obiota–brain \naxis�” I mbalance in the gut microbiota, called dysbiosis, can \nincrease intestinal permeability, allowing pathogens to trig-\nger inflammation in distant organs � Despite these established \nconnections, no research has explored the link between gut \nmicrobiota alterations and inner ear function � To address this \ngap, this study delved into the molecular mechanisms under -\nlying a potential association between gut microbiota altera-\ntions and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) � T o this aim, we used a mouse model of gut dysbiosis induced by dex -\ntran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment, supplemented with fe -\ncal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from donor patients \nwith active (aUC) or remissive (rUC) ulcerative colitis � This \nenabled us to exacerbate or ameliorate the microbiome im-\nbalance, respectively �  Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) \nwere conducted alongside morphological, immunofluores -\ncence, and molecular analyses � ABR results revealed a sig -\nnificant increase in auditory thresholds in mice subjected to \nDSS and FMT-aUC treatments � Conversely, FMT from rUC \ndonors exhibited a protective effect on auditory function, \nhighlighting the beneficial impact of microbiota restoration � \nMorphological evaluations revealed loss of outer hair cells \n(OHCs), degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), \nand atrophy of the stria vascularis in mice with gut dysbio-\nsis� Conversely, FMT from rUC donors displayed a protec -\ntive effect on cochlear structures � Immunofluorescence and \nWestern blot analyses unveiled increased oxidative stress and \ninflammation in cochlear tissues of mice with gut microbi -\nota alterations, while restoration of microbiota composition \nexerted otoprotective effects �

University of Antwerp, Belgium\nThe present study focuses on DFNA9, an autosomal dominant \ndisorder caused by pathogenic variants in the COCH  gene �  \nThese mutations induce the formation of aggregates that are toxic to the fibrocytes in the extracellular matrix, ultimately \nleading to degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), \nwhich are crucial for transmitting auditory signals from the \ncochlea to the brain � An important tool for evaluating the \nfunction of the SGNs, which are the target cells of a cochle -\nar implant (CI), is the electrically evoked compound action \npotential (eCAP) � Therefore, the main objective is to evalu -\nate the eCAP to describe the function of the SGNs and study \ncochlear health in CI patients with DFNA9 �\nFor this reason, we included 15 carriers of the p � Pro51Ser var -\niant in the COCH gene who received a Med-El CI (DFNA9 \ngroup) and 15 matched control CI subjects without DFNA9 \nto compare the impedances and subsequently the threshold, \namplitude and slope of the eCAP amplitude growth function \n(AGF) � These parameters were evaluated from intraoperative \nautoART recordings (Med-El) during CI surgery �  Matching \nof the two groups was based on sex, age at implantation, du -\nration of deafness, and type of implant � The first results, re -\ngarding the difference in impedance between DFNA9 and \nnon-DFNA9 patients, show a significant interaction between \ntime and group in the middle and basal electrodes, indicating \nthat electrode impedances were similar in the early phase af -\nter implantation between the two groups, but increased sig -\nnificantly more for the DFNA9 group up to one year after \nimplantation � Secondly, the results show that the success rate \n(present or absent) to record eCAP responses is lower in the \nDNFA9 group: eCAPs were detectable in 75 �5% of the intra -\noperative measurements (145/192) in comparison to 96 �9% \n(186/192) in the group without DFNA9 � ECAP absence in \nthe DFNA9 group was observed across the whole electrode \narray, but more pronounced in the basal region (channels 11 \nand 12) � Additionally, comparing the parameters of the AGF, \nthe maximum eCAP amplitude was consistently smaller and the AGF slope consistently shallower for the DFNA9 group \ncompared to the control group throughout the entirety of \nthe electrode array �  Finally, the eCAP thresholds in patients \nwith DFNA9 were higher compared to those in the control \npatients for all cochlear locations � To our knowledge, this is \nthe first study to investigate the eCAP measurements in pa -\ntients with DFNA9 � As proven in the literature, eCAP meas -\nures correlate well with the health and survival of SGC � This means that the results of our study predominantly suggest \nthat DFNA9 leads to an even stronger reduction in excitabili -\nty and neuronal health than seen in other causes of deafness �\nDevelopment of a

neuron (SGN) loss and subsequent hearing loss � The \nobjective of this study was to compare various methods of \nouabain administration in the middle and inner ear to char -\nacterize its ototoxic effects in guinea pigs � Different routes \nof administration and doses of ouabain were tested: 1, 3 and 10 mM administered via round window injection (RWI), a \nround window membrane deposit (RWM) or transtympan -\nic administration (TT) � Several parameters were assessed, \nfrom the injection volumes (5, 10, 20 µL), to the injected ear \n(L/R) and the repetition of administration (up to 3 times) � \nSpecific care was provided to the treated guinea pigs with \nconsideration to hydration and food supplementation � ABR \nthresholds and DPOAE amplitudes were measured between \nbaseline (BL) and T+7DAYS or T+14DAYS to evaluate hear -\ning impairments � These functional measures were correlated \nwith histological analyses, SGN counts, inner hair cell (IHC) \nand outer hair cell (OHC) counts � Both RWI and RWM, at \n3 and 10 mM, induced important hearing loss demonstrat -\ned by a significant increase of ABR thresholds followed by \nconsiderable SGN loss � Moreover, a decrease of DPOAE am -\nplitudes and some inflammatory processes were observed, \neven at the lowest dose of all the ouabain administrations � \nInterestingly, IHC and OHC numbers were similar after a 1 mM ouabain injection whereas DPOAE amplitudes dramat -\nically decreased �  However, a 1 mM dose of ouabain admin -\nistered via TT generated a decrease of DPOAE amplitudes, \nwithout affecting ABR thresholds and neither the SGN nor \nthe HC count � Apart from the TT ouabain administration, all \nthe tested approaches generated various health issues, such \nas major weight loss, ear necrosis, rectal prolapse and high \nmortality �  Ultimately, ouabain administration in the middle \nor inner ear of guinea pigs is ototoxic with heterogenous re -\nsults, not limited to SGN loss � C oncomitantly,

basilar papilla (BP), can regenerate HCs through direct \nconversion of supporting cells (SCs) or mitotic proliferation \nof SCs � To explore molecular mechanisms for HC regenera -\ntion in chick BP , we previously established an explant culture model of chick BP , in which HC regeneration occurs predom -\ninantly via direct conversion of SCs (Matsunaga et al � , 2020) \nand performed single-cell RNA sequencing (Matsunaga et al � , \n2023) by using our model �  A pseudotime trajectory analy -\nsis for the process of SC-to-HC conversion revealed that SCs were once reprogrammed to the precursor state, followed by \ndifferentiation into HCs (Matsunaga et al � , 2023) �  In addition, \nwe observed temporal upregulation of EDNRB2 encoded en -\ndothelin receptor b2 in reprogrammed SCs as differentially \nexpressed genes during SC-to-HC conversion � I n the current \nstudy, we examined the expression patterns of EDNRB2 in \nthe developing chick BP to determine which stage progenitor \nor precursor populations express EDNRB2 � The expression \nof EDNRB2 in BP was found only in the time points when \nHC differentiation was initiated, not in common progenitors \nfor HCs and SCs or immature HCs and SCs after fate deter -\nmination � The result supports our hypothesis that EDNRB2 \nis a marker for HC precursors and indicates that SCs are re -\nprogrammed to the precursor state

Kindai University, Osaka, Japan\nSensorineural hearing loss is usually intractable because of \nvirtually no capacity for hair cell (HC) regeneration in mam -\nmals � In contrast to mammals, lower vertebrates including \nbirds have the capability for HC regeneration � Elucidation \nof precise mechanisms for HC regeneration in avian audi -\ntory epithelia will contribute to exploring key molecules \nfor inducing HC regeneration in mammals � We previously  \nestablished an explant culture model of the chick auditory \nepithelium, namely basilar papilla (BP), showing total HC \nloss and consecutive HC regeneration through direct con -\nversion of supporting cells (SCs) to HCs (Matsunaga, 2020) � \nSingle-cell RNA sequencing using this model illustrated dy-namic changes in expressed genes in BP SCs during direct \nconversion, which indicates that reprogramming of SCs to \nthe precursor state occurs before differentiation into HCs \n(Matsunaga, 2023) � To explore mechanisms of SC reprogram -\nming toward hair cell regeneration in chick BP , we performed \nan integrated analysis of RNA- and ATAC-seq of chick BP \nexplant cultures during the early phase (three time points) of

\ncells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), but its function is \nstill unknown � For the first time, we created a mouse model \nwith Isl1 conditional deletion in the SGNs, and in our previ -\nous study of adult Isl1CKO mice, we identified the significant \nrole of Isl1 in the phenotype and function of the SGNs � Here, \nwe present the results of our cellular and molecular assess -\nment of the SGNs’ embryonic development in the Isl1CKO �  \nUsing immunolabeling, we studied the 3D structure of the \ncochlea by confocal and light-sheet microscopy through dif -\nferent stages of development � Exploiting the reporter pro -\ntein, we inspected the axon projection characteristics in the \nIsl1CKO by time-lapse imaging of the cochlear explant � At \nthe molecular level, we performed RNA sequencing to assess \nthe transcriptional regulation impact of ISL1 � In addition, we \ninvestigated the involvement of ISL1 in epigenetics regula-\ntion by performing the CUT&Tag assay for important histone \nmarkers � We observed that from early developmental stages, \nthe SGNs of the Isl1CKO manifested a problem in migration \nand axonogenesis � And while the proliferation of SGNs was \nnot affected a gradual increase in apoptosis was detected �  In \nIsl1CKO, despite the wrong location, SGNs projected axon fibers towards the target cells, however, axonogenesis start -\ned earlier and advanced faster than the control, resulting in \ndisorganized and overshooting axons � Similarly, our RNA se -\nquencing of the Isl1CKO’s SGNs showed massive changes in the expression of the genes essential for neuronal commu -\nnication, migration, survival, and axon projection including DCC , Robo , Unc-5, Nrp, members of the EphA  family, Ntrk2 , \nNtrk3\n� Interestingly, we identified a sizeable overlap between \nthe downregulated genes and the genes with altered histone modification, such as EphA5, Unc5b, and Grin3a , indicating \nthat ISL1 not only directly interacts with downstream genes \nto regulate their expressions, but also employs the epigenetics \nmachinery to demethylase H3K27me3, and promote the ex -\npression of genes essential in neuronal development, axono

is commonly referred to as the extend -\ned high frequency (EHF) range �  This study aimed to investi -\ngate the connection between EHF hearing thresholds (HTs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) in \nadult subjects � Factors such as the presence of spontaneous \notoacoustic emissions (SOAEs), gender, ear side, and aging \nwere of interest �\nMaterial and methods: Participants consisted of 95 adults � \nThe age ranged from 21 to 77 years, with an average of 42  ±  14 � \nThere were 55 women, comprising 58% of the whole group �  \nAll subjects had normal middle

Specifically, we focused on two genes associated with \nsignificant auditory impairments: USH2A, hereditary deaf-\nblindness, and COCH, implicated in late-onset genetic hear -\ning loss, the latter

      "text": "HMGA2 mediates tonotopic identity in the developing \nmouse cochlea\nChakraborty S., Ruhala J., Cassinotti L., Corfas G., \nWaldhaus J.\nDepartment of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University \nof Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\nHMGA2  belongs to the non-histone chromosomal high-  \n-mobility group (HMG) protein family and binds to DNA \nat promoter and enhancer regions � The chromatin modifier \nplays a role in recruiting other factors such as histone acet -\nylases, which together with HMGA2 form a structure called \nthe enhanceosome that has impact on local chromatin struc -\nture and therefore gene expression � In the cochlea, HMGA2  is \ntonotopically expressed �  However, its relevance for frequency \nspecific hearing remains to be determined �  Sonic hedgehog, \na tonotopic morphogen, forms an apex-to-base decreasing \ngradient in the cochlea � To study the impact of hedgehog \nsignaling on HMGA2 expression, the hedgehog pathway was \nactivated in vivo using a gain-of-function mouse model �  On \nthe other hand, retinoic acid forms a base-to-apex decreas -\ning morphogen gradient, thereby opposing sonic hedgehog �  \nTo modulate retinoic acid levels in vivo, gain- and loss-of-\nfunction mouse models were used �  Furthermore, condition -\nal knockout of Hmga2  from the otocyst stage was established \nto study the relevance of HMGA2 using histological staining \nand hearing measurements � Constitutive activation of the HH \npathway resulted in ectopic expression of HMGA2 � Retinoic \nacid in turn was found to limit the extension of the HMGA2 \ngradient towards the base �  This finding indicates that position -\nal information mediated by tonotopic morphogen gradients \nestablish the Hmga2  gradient in vivo �  Conditional knockout

this work, we used different transgenic mouse \nlines to establish that embryonic patterning via retinoic acid \nand sonic hedgehog establish the HMGA2 gradient along \nthe tonotopic axis � Also, loss of Hmga2  demonstrated that \nthe chromatin modifier is necessary for the development of \nlow-frequency hearing in the adult animal �  Together, these \nresults indicate that HMGA2 is an integral

auditory nerve cells can lead to au -\nditory neuropathy, even when the hair cells and the coch -\nlear nucleus remain intact � Cell-based therapy for replacing \nlost or dysfunctional auditory neurons may restore hearing \nin these cases and enhance the degree of success of a coch -\nlear implant procedure by repopulating the cochlea with \ntransplanted, functional auditory neurons �  We developed a novel proprietary differentiation process to manufacture \nLCTANP1 composed of Auditory Neuron Progenitors from \nclinical grade line of pluripotent human stem cells �\nMaterial and methods: The manufacturing process starts \nwith a series of differentiation cues, in specific time frames, \nand ends by harvesting the auditory neuron progenitors cells, \nand cryopreserving them as LCTANP1 drug product in a \nready to administer format � LCTANP1 cells were character -\nized by biological and functionally relevant sets of markers, \nusing different quantitative methods that we newly developed \nand customized such as analysis of specific protein marker expression by flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence and \nexpression profiles, including RNA sequencing �  Functional \nin-vitro assays were developed to measure neuronal prop -\nerties of LCTANP1, such as the ability to elicit calcium in -\nflux� Fluorescent labeled LCTANP1 cells were delivered to \nthe base of the cochleae of eight ouabain-treated guinea pigs by a cochleostomy and via the scala tympani, or the modi -\nolus� Seven days later, animals were euthanized and labeled \nLCTANP1 cells were visualized within the cochlea using a \nfluorescence stereoscope and by human specific immuno -\nfluorescent staining �\nResults: LCTANP1 cells were successfully manufactured at \nscale, met pre-set release criteria, and demonstrated relevant \nactivity in in-vitro functional tests � L CTANP1 cells were cry -\nopreserved in a ready-to-administer, thaw and inject for -\nmat and were successfully thawed, successfully transplanted \nand survived a 7-days study in an in-vivo Guinea pig model �  \nLCTANP1 cells are currently being evaluated in a function -\nal model of hearing simultaneous with

become a standard goal of coch-\nlear implantation � A  new method of monitoring cochlear \nfunction has become available using the intracochlear elect-\nrocochleography or intracochlear ECochG � This measurement \nallows via intracochlear electrodes of the cochlear implant \nitself to record the response to acoustic stimuli �  The feasi -\nbility of such recordings was presented at the XXXII World \nCongress of Audiology in 2014 � I ntracochlear ECochG is \na sensitive measurement of cochlear function that allows for \ndetection of basilar membrane contact in Flex arrays � Our \nprevious study (Lorens et al � , 2019) showed that the meas -\nurements of acoustically evoked intracochlear potentials via the location dependent intracochlear electrodes are system -\natically recordable in a wide range of postoperative hearing \nabilities of cochlear implantees � The most sensitive location within the cochlea to record CM potentials depends on the \nfrequency tone used �  The deeper in the cochlea the mean \nmaximum CM peak-to-peak amplitude is, the lower the stim -\nulating tone frequency will be �  Multiple recordings along the \ncochlea provide a method for assessing cochlear mechanics � \nIn this study, we use this approach to test for electrophysio -\nlogical evidence of basilar membrane fixation, demonstrat -\ned by a substantial basal or apical shift of maximum ECochG \nresponse away from the characteristic frequency of the stim -\nulus� The hearing preservation rates and speech outcomes \nwill be presented and compared in 16 cochlear implantees �\nInput ear impedance and eardrum energy reflectance \nvariations related to increase in intracochlear and \nintracranial pressure\nBotti T.1, Cerini L.1, Sanjust F.1, Sisto R.1, Sharma Y .2, \nMoleti4A.2\n1 INAIL, Monte Porzio Catone, Rome, Italy\n2 University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy\nVariations of the intracranial pressure (ICP) are expected in \nparticular pathologies, in microgravity conditions, and as -\nsociated with postural changes � Lumbar puncture is a di -\nrect but highly invasive ICP diagnostic method �  Mechanical \nmodels of the inner and middle ear suggest an indirect non-\ninvasive method based on acoustic measurements � Since the \ncerebro-spinal fluid is in contact with the intracochlear flu -\nid, a change of the pressure in the lymphatic fluid of the pe-\nripheral hearing system gives information about variations of \nthe ICP �  In particular, the increase in the cochlear fluid pres -\nsure is measurable as increase of the middle ear reflectance \nand, consequently, the otoacoustic emission (OAE) phase \n(Buki et al � , 1996; Avan et al � , 2018; Voss et al � , 2010) �  Avan \net al�  (2000) theoretically characterized the enhancement of \nthe middle ear stiffness in terms of stapedius reflex activi -\nty as a reduction of the stapes compliance and observed the \nrelative increase of the distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs) \nphase �  As ICP changes can be induced by postural chang -\nes, we use theoretical models of middle ear transmission to discuss how and why the reactance of input ear impedance \nZ changes with the body posture, showing correlation with \nthe increase and the frequency shift of the eardrum energy \nreflectance, and the DPOAE phase changes � Specifically, in \nthe low-frequency range, the reactance of Z is stiffness-domi -\nnated, thus it is a negative function of (and inversely propor -\ntional to) frequency �  When a tested subject changes position \nfrom orthostatism to clinostatism, the negative term of reac-\ntance decreases and the frequency of null reactance increases � \nThis evidence is in accordance with the reduction of the sta -\npes compliance which is most relevant at very low frequen -\ncy� These results help providing a theoretical basis to (and a \nconnection among) the empirical methods for the indirect estimate of ICP variations based on the monitor of different \nobservable consequences of the variation of the middle ear \ntransmission, which can be applied in microgravity condi -\ntions or also in cerebrospinal diseases �\nIEB 2024 Abstracts • 93–143\n108\n

effectors with contrasting functions during inner ear sensory organ \nformation\nŻak M., de Andres J., Terry S., Gale J., Daudet N.\nUCL Ear Institute, University College London, UK\nThe inner ear is composed of several sensory organs respon -\nsible for the detection of sound, head position and accelera -\ntion� D uring embryonic development, these organs originate \nfrom neurosensory-competent domains within the otocyst, \nbut the molecular signals controlling sensory organ forma -\ntion remain unclear �  The transcription factor Sox2  is required for neurosensory specification since its deletion abolishes the \ndifferentiation of sensory organs and their associated neu -\nrons � Sox2  is initially present throughout the otocyst, but it \nbecomes restricted to the ventro medial aspect � Our recent \nwork suggests that this restriction is regulated in a dose-de -\npendent manner by a dorso ventral gradient (from high to \nlow) of canonical Wnt activity �  Dorsally, high levels of Wnt \nactivity inhibit sensory organ formation whereas ventrally, \nlow levels are needed to maintain prosensory specification � To \nfind out how Wnt signalling can exert these two contrasting functions, we analysed the expression and function of four \nmembers of the Tcf/Lef family of transcription factors (Lef1, \nTcf7, Tcf7l1  and Tcf7l2 ) in the chicken otocyst � W e found that \nall members of the family are expressed in the otocyst but \nthat each factor has a unique expression pattern � Our func -\ntional studies suggest that only Lef1 and Tcf7l2 contribute to \nprosensory specification � The expression pattern of Lef1 and \nits gain-of-function effect reflect high levels of Wnt activi -\nty, while the distribution of Tcf7l2 and the effect of its over -\nexpression are consistent with low levels of Wnt activity �  In \nsummary, our results suggest that Lef1 and Tcf7l2 transcrip-\ntion factors are key effectors of the Wnt activity gradient dur -\ning inner ear

Health and Science University, Portland, \nUSA\nIntroduction: Prolonged exposure to loud sounds can re -\nsult in noise-induced hearing loss � Among sounds of differ -\nent frequencies, loud high frequencies are damaging to base \nof the cochlea while loud low frequencies induce damage in \nthe larger range of cochlea � Research has predominantly fo -\ncused on the effects of high-frequency noise, though the con -\nsequences of loud low-frequency sounds (LFS) on cochlear \nfunction have received almost no attention �\nObjective: The primary objective of this study was to inves-\ntigate adverse effects of loud-LFS on cochlear sound trans -\nduction and sound transmission in guinea pigs �\nMaterial and methods: Under anesthesia, guinea pigs were \nexposed to 200 Hz at 120 dB SPL for 40 mins, while controls \nreceived similar exposure at 55 dB SPL � The distortion prod -\nuct otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and compound actional \npotential (CAP) thresholds were measured to evaluate outer \nhair cell (OHC) function and sound transmission to brain, re -\nspectively �  In a different cohort of surgical guinea pigs, organ \nof corti (OoC) vibrations were recorded at the apex of coch -\nlea, using optical coherence tomography �  All measurements \nwere taken before and after the sound exposure �\nResults: We present that loud-LFS knocks out CAP for all \ntested frequencies, from 0 �5 to 32 kHz � However, DPOAEs \namplitudes remain unchanged to similar exposure �  These \nfindings suggest that loud-LFS selectively impairs sound \ntransmission to brain without altering the hearing thresh -\nold, particularly in the cochlear region specific to middle \nto high frequencies � However, subsequent investigations of \nloud-LFS impact on apical cochlear mechanics revealed that loud-LFS alters apical frequency resolution by causing an up -\nward shift in OoC best frequency �  Our results also show a de -\ncrease in OoC vibrations at all frequencies, particularly more \npronounced at frequencies below and above the best frequen -\ncy� Vibration magnitude reductions were largest at low stim -\nulus levels while alterations at intense stimulus levels were \ninsignificant, reflecting a loud-LFS mediated impairment of \nOHC driven amplification at the apex of the cochlea � These \nresponse-magnitude changes were accompanied by morpho -\nlogical alterations within the cochlea �\nConclusions: These findings suggest that loud-LFS  c auses se -\nlective damage, impairing cochlear sound transmission across \na wide range while preserving OHC transduction at  c ochlear \nbase and damaging it at the apex �\nMapping human inner ear development: insights from \nsingle-nucleus transcriptomics\nvan der Valk W .H.1, van Beelen

activating macrophages and glial cells (Paciello et \nal�, 2024) �  Considering that alterations in the auditory cortex \ninduced by peripheral damage can be linked with cognitive \nimpairment and altered hippocampal functions (Paciello et \nal�, 2021; Paciello et al � , 2023), we wondered if the ototoxic \neffect of styrene could also be associated with cognitive dys -\nfunctions � Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate \nthe relationship between styrene ototoxicity and cognitive \nimpairment � To this aim, adult male Wistar rats were ex -\nposed to styrene for 5 days a week during 3 weeks at a dose \nof 400 mg/kg �  Hearing loss and damage to neural transmis -\nsion were assessed by recording auditory brainstem respons-\nes (ABR) and by performing wave II latency and

H., Sharaf R., Naldrett K.\nDepartment of Communicative Disorders and Sciences, University \nat Buffalo, NY , USA\nIntroduction: The cochlea is vulnerable to various patholog -\nical conditions, with sensory cells typically being the primary \ntarget of damage �  However, supporting cells also experience significant impacts � Despite their critical role in maintain -\ning the structural and functional integrity of the sensory \nepithelium, the responses of supporting cells to cochlear \ndamage are not well understood �  This study aims to charac -\nterize the reactions of supporting cells to sensory cell dam-\nage in mouse cochleae �\nMaterial and methods: The study utilized a mouse model of \ncochlear damage induced by cyclodextrin to simulate the oto -\ntoxicity of the cochlea � A single dose of cyclodextrin treatment \ncaused cochlear damage with a damaging pattern similar to \nthat caused by aminoglycoside antibiotics � The cochleae were \nexamined at various time points after the treatment to evalu -\nate supporting cell survival patterns and the roles of various types of supporting cells in the repair process of the organ of \nCorti �  We also examined the vulnerability of different sup -\nporting cell populations and cochlear responses to support -\ning cell pathogenesis �\nResults: Cyclodextrin exposure caused considerable senso-\nry cell loss, particularly outer hair cell loss � Despite signif -\nicant sensory cell damage, most supporting cells survived � \nThese surviving cells not only helped maintain the structure \nof the organ of Corti but also expressed immune molecules � \nHowever, the basal end of the cochlea exhibited noticea -\nble supporting cell death, with quantitative analysis indicat -\ning that pillar cells were the most vulnerable, followed by \nDeiters’ cells � This supporting cell death triggered the local \nexpression of immune molecules in the surrounding sup -\nporting cells � Additionally, macrophages were observed in ar -\neas where supporting cells were absent at the chronic phase but not in regions with sensory cell loss at the acute stage of \ncochlear damage �\nConclusions: This study elucidates the complex dynamics \nof supporting cell responses in the cochlea following dam -\nage, demonstrating that while most of these cells retain their \nstructural integrity and initiate immune responses, they ex -\nhibit varied vulnerability to cochlear insults � Th e findings \nemphasize the importance of supporting cells in cochlear re -\ncovery processes and the potential of targeting these cells for \ntherapeutic strategies aimed at restoring auditory function �\nThe border and inner-phalangeal cells are required to \nsynchronize the calcium action potentials in developing \ninner hair

inner hair cells (IHCs) \nelicit sensory-independent Ca2+ action potentials (APs) that \npropagate along the auditory pathway and is required for the maturation of the IHCs and for the refinement of the neural \ncircuitry �  The AP activity in IHCs is believe to the synchro -\nnized by spontaneous ATP-induced Ca2+ waves originating \nin the non-sensory supporting cells (SCs) � This ATP sig

investigates the expression and functional implications \nof H3R in the inner ear of postnatal c57BL/6 mice �\nMaterial and methods: Immunofluorescent staining was \nemployed to determine the localization of H3R in the coch -\nlea of postnatal day 3–5 (P3-5) mice �  Cochlear explants \nwere cultured for 24 hours in the presence of one of two \nH3R  a gonist/antagonists, Ciproxifan or Pitolisant, at vari -\nous concentrations (10 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM) � The effect of \nCiproxifan and Pitolisant on hair cells (HCs) and spiral gan -\nglion neurons (SGNs) morphology was assessed using fluo-\nrescent microscopy �\nResults: H3R expression was detected in HCs and SGNs � \nExposure to Ciproxifan induced significant damage and loss of inner and outer HCs in a concentration-dependent man

information into \nelectrical signals depends on the mechanically induced dis -\nplacement of stereociliary bundles projecting from the api -\ncal surface of the sensory hair cells � Hair bundle deflection \nopens mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels locat-\ned at the tips of the shorter rows of adjacent stereocilia � The \ngating of the MET channels requires force supplied by the \ntensioning of tip links during sound-induced bundle dis -\nplacement � The motor protein MYO7A, which is an uncon -\nventional myosin responsible for syndromic (Usher 1B) or \nnon-syndromic recessive deafness in humans when mutat -\ned, has long been associated with tip-link tensioning, but \nconclusive evidence is still lacking �  In this study, we investi -\ngated the role of MYO7A in mature hair cells using condi -\ntional knockout mice �\nMaterial and methods: The role of MYO7A in mature hair \ncells was investigated using conditional Myo7afl/flMyo15-cre \nmice in which the delayed downregulation of the protein al -\nlowed normal cochlear development and hearing function \nup to about postnatal day 20 � Patch clamp electrophysiolo -\ngy was used to record the MET current, which was elicited by displacing the hair bundles of the IHCs and OHCs with \na piezo-driven fluid jet � The morphology of the stereociliary \nbundles and their molecular composition was

Health Sciences, Eye \nClinic, Ophthalmology Clinic, University of Trieste, Italy\nIntroduction: The definition of a molecular diagnosis for \npatients affected by hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is signifi -\ncantly hampered by the extreme clinical and genetic hetero -\ngeneity that characterise the condition � In particular, peculiar \nand understudied cases are those of non-syndromic mimics \n(NSM), meaning patients with particularly mild forms of syn -\ndromic HHL or initially presenting isolated deafness and de -\nlayed onset of other clinical signs �\nMaterial and methods: In the last 18 months, a cohort of \n73 apparently non-syndromic Italian HHL patients has been \nenrolled in the study �  All the individuals were negative at \nGJB2 and STRC  genetic tests and underwent whole-exome \n sequencing, aiming to define a molecular diagnosis and even -\ntually identify NSMs �\nResults: A molecular diagnosis was provided for 36/73 pa -\ntients (49 �3%), and 12 of them could be classified as NSMs � \nIn detail, two groups of patients could be highlighted: (1) \npatients presenting subtle additional signs that were missed \nduring the first clinical evaluation and (2) patients whose \nmolecular diagnosis suggests the future development of ad -\nditional clinical features � In Group 1, two patients were iden -\ntified, and they carried pathogenic variants within the MITF \nand GATA3 genes, which are associated with Waardenburg \nand Barakat syndromes, respectively � A s regards Group 2, ten \npatients were detected, and the involved genes were CDH23 \n(one patient), USH2A (six patients) and ADGRV1 (three pa -\ntients) � Thus, these results suggest that Usher syndrome type \n2 accounts for the vast majority of NSMs (75%) � Moreover, \nthese considerations further confirm our previous findings \nregarding the high prevalence of Usher syndrome type 2 car -\nriers in the Italian population (1: 70) �Conclusions: Identifying patients within Group 1 of NSMs \nhighlights the importance of a critical re-evaluation of the di -\nagnostic criteria of each condition and provides crucial in -\nsight into the clinical characteristics of very mild forms of \nsyndromic deafness � On the other hand, the clinical condi -\ntion of Group 2 NSM patients will be evaluated by a multi -\ndisciplinary team in order to provide personalised follow-up \nand

Sciences, University of Pavia, \nItaly\nPimozide is a conventional antipsychotic of the diphenylb -\nutylpiperidine class widely used for treating schizophrenia, \ndelusional disorders, and managing motor and phonic tics \nin Tourette’s syndrome �  Its primary mechanism of action in \nthe central nervous system is as a dopaminergic D2 recep -\ntor antagonist � Additionally, Pimozide is known for blocking \nvarious types of voltage-gated calcium and potassium chan -\nnels� Among its side effects, dizziness and balance disorders \nare the most observed �\nThis study delved into the effects of Pimozide on ionic cur -\nrents in vestibular hair cells � Using the patch-clamp whole-cell \ntechnique, we studied the effect of Pimozide at a concentra -\ntion of 3 μM on the ionic currents expressed by chicken em -\nbryo vestibular Type-I and Type-II hair cells, as well as on \nmammalian Type-II hair cells � Consistent with a previous re -\nport on chicken embryo, Pimozide significantly increased the \ndelayed outward rectifying K+ current of Type-II hair cells \non mouse �  In chicken embryo, the drug also notably reduced \nthe inward (anomalous) rectifying K+ current and the mixed \nNa+/K+ (Ih) current �\nIn Type-I hair cells, Pimozide showed no significant effect on \nIK,L, a large low-voltage activated outward rectifying K+ cur -\nrent absent in Type-II cells, nor on the small delayed outward \nrectifying K+ current � The latter result suggests that the de -\nlayed rectifying K+ current involves different channel subu -\nnits in the two hair cell types � Additionally, Pimozide did not \nalter the inward Na+ current expressed by Type-I hair cells �\nIn conclusion, these findings highlight that Pimozide selec -\ntively impacts potassium channels in Type-II, but not Type-I, \nhair cells � The drug acts as a delayed outward rectifying po -\ntassium channel opener in Type-II cells, potentially leading to a decrease in afferent signal transmission from these cells \nto primary sensory neurons � While providing a possible ex -\nplanation for the vestibular side effects of Pimozide, the above \nresults also open up possibilities for its use in reducing altered \nvestibular input in various vestibular disorders �\nIEB 2024 Abstracts • 93–143\n118\n Journal of Hearing Science  ·  2 024 Vol. 14  ·  N o. 3"

demonstrated that \nthe primary ototoxic effect of styrene is mediated by the in -\nterplay between oxidative stress and inflammation � Indeed, \nas reactive oxygen species accumulate, the cochlea’s natural \nantioxidant defenses become inadequate, leading to oxida -\ntive status imbalance and enhanced inflammatory markers, \nresponsible for hair cell death and hearing loss � Nowadays \neffective therapeutic interventions for styrene-induced oto -\ntoxicity are still lacking �  In this study, we compared the pro -\ntective effects of an antioxidant molecule, rosmarinic acid \n(RA), and an anti-inflammatory agent, anakinra (Ana), an \nantagonist of the IL-1β receptor, to evaluate their potential \nas novel pharmacological treatments against styrene-induced \nototoxicity �  To this aim, adult male Wistar rats were exposed \nto styrene (400 mg/kg) by gavage for 3 weeks, 5 consecutive \ndays/week � Before each styrene administration, a subgroup \nof animals was treated with RA at a dosage of 10 mg/kg in -\ntraperitoneally injected, whereas a second subgroup received \na dosage of 40 mg/kg of Ana by intramuscular injection � To \nassess the efficacy of the two different

the model integrates various physiological as -\npects across the entire auditory system, this study primarily \nexamines the distribution of CaV1 �3 channels in inner hair \ncell ribbon synapses and

challenge and, currently, only one drug has been ap -\nproved by Food and Drug Administration as an effective treat -\nment � Thus, several efforts are needed to better understand \ncisplatin mechanism of damage and to explore new therapeu -\ntic strategies � Although the potential effects of brain-derived \nneurotrophic factor (BDNF) have previously been investigat -\ned in some

delivery in counteracting cochlear damage \nin an in in vivo model of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity �  Thus, \nadult Wistar rats were treated with cisplatin (12 mg/kg, in -\ntraperitoneally injected) and after one hour, they received \n5 mg/kg of rhBDNF suspended in a thermogel by a tran -\nstympanic injection � Auditory brainstem responses were re -\ncorded to evaluate hearing function at 1, 3

molecular \nmechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of our rhBDNF \nformulation � Our data showed that rhBDNF mitigates hearing \nloss in cisplatin-exposed rats by preserving synaptic connec-\ntions in the cochlear epithelium and reducing hair cell and \nspiral ganglion neuron death � rhBDNF maintains the balance \nof its receptor levels (pTrkB and p75), boosting TrkB-CREB \npro-survival signalling and reducing caspase 3-dependent \napoptosis in the cochlea � Additionally, it activates antioxi -\ndant mechanisms while inhibiting inflammation and promot -\ning vascular

genes for \nnon-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, presenting attrac -\ntive targets for gene therapy interventions � These approach -\nes also have the potential to enhance conventional treatment \nstrategies � Particularly interesting in this regard are cochle -\nar implants (CI), used for severe to profound HL � However, \ntheir efficacy is believed to depend on spiral ganglion neu -\nron (SGN) survival �  Recognizing the potential of neurotro -\nphins to enhance SGN survival and improve CI outcomes, \nwe here report on the development of a novel adeno-associat -\ned virus (AAV) vector optimized for transducing SGN, even \nin adult mice and at low vector doses � For this purpose, the \ncapsid was engineered to display a heptamer peptide, which \nwas previously derived from a phage

from patients with isolated profound prelingual deafness \nwho received CI before the age of 24 months � All patients \nwere negative for DFNB1 locus pathogenic variants � Genomic \nDNA was isolated from blood samples � In probands whole ex -\nome sequencing (WES) was performed �  Validation of select -\ned variants and family segregation analysis were performed \nusing standard Sanger sequencing �  Identified copy number \nvariants were examined with aCGH and qPCR �  Evaluation \nof patients auditory development was performed with the \nLittlEARS questionnaire (LEAQ) in three subsequent inter

limited to non-linear distortion-prod -\nuct otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) � Linear reflection-type \nstimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) have not \nyet been established for this species and may provide addi -\ntional information about cochlear amplification, tuning and \nonset of hearing loss � In human studies, inclusion of both \nOAE types in cochlear assessment may provide complimen -\ntary information � Here we report initial efforts to broaden \nthe toolbox for time-efficient and objective assessment of \ncochlear function in rats with swept-stimulus DPOAE and \nSFOAE measurements �\nSFOAE measurement feasibility and repeatability were first \nconfirmed in male Wistar rats � Then, for fixed level OAEs \nmeasured across range of frequencies, we implemented a \n“swept-tone” paradigm, testing various frequency sweep rates � \nTo further speed up data collection, the frequency range (~4–\n40 kHz) was divided into 2 or 3 subranges played simultane -\nously �  Results of single vs �  multiple frequency sweep SFOAE \nand DPOAE at varying rates were compared to OAEs meas -\nured with steady-state discrete tones � W e also studied the \neffects of sweeping the stimulus level, at fixed frequency for \nmeasurements of DPOAE input-output functions at six f2 fre -\nquencies � Stimulus levels were swept at variable rates with up \nto three pairs of stimulus frequencies were played simultane -\nously �  Results were compared to DPOAE input-output func -\ntions measured with discrete tones �\nFor the SFOAE repeatability test, a conventional discrete-\ntone suppression paradigm was used �  The maximum aver -\nage within-subject differences were 5 �0 ±  7 � 1 dB within-day \nand 6 �2 ±  13 � 5 dB between days �\nSwept-tone SFOAE and DPOAE recordings showed ampli -\ntudes similar to discrete-tone with rates up to 2 octaves/\nsec� Whereas DPOAEs could be recorded with 3 simultane -\nous sweeps (<3 dB difference), SFOAE results from multiple \nsweeps were not as consistent � Swept-level DPOAEs produced \nresults identical to discrete-tone up to a 80 dB/sec rate and allowed simultaneous recording of 3 frequencies without in-\nterference �  These data confirm that SFOAEs can be measured \nin a consistent and time-efficient manner in rats, with levels \ncomparable to other laboratory species � Further work aims \nIEB 2024 Abstracts •

Australia\n4  O tolaryngology Section, Department of Neuroscience DNS, \nUniversity of Padova, Italy\n5  H uman Anatomy Section, Department of Neuroscience DNS, \nUniversity of Padova, Italy\nThe cochlear implant (CI) is currently the gold standard in \ntreating sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as it activates the \ncochlear nerve bypassing the hair cells, allowing the brain to \nhear sound waves � The goal of ongoing research is to create \nself-powered cochlear stimulation devices based on piezoelec -\ntric nanomaterials that can improve the quality of life for pa -\ntients with SNHL and reduce the side effects of traditional CIs �\nPolyvinyldifluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric nanofibers are a \nnew type of piezoelectric nanostructure developed for bio-\nlogical purposes � The fiber can be coated with barium titan -\nate (BaTiO3) nanoparticles or graphene nanosheets (GN) \nto enhance the piezoelectric coefficients � The purpose of the \nstudy is to evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility of PVDF na -\nnofibers, which appear promising as alternatives for produc-\ning next-generation CIs �\nPure PVDF, BaTiO3-coated PVDF, and GN-coated PVDF \nwere evaluated on three cell lines: HaCaT, OC-k3, and PC12 � \nViability, morphological changes, and neuritic outgrowth \nwere evaluated in vitro using these cell lines as a model for \nthe cochlear tissues �\nThe morphology study indicated that HaCaT, OC-k3, and \nPC12 cells were healthy, well-preserved, and had normal \nstructural characteristics at all times tested � A ccording to cell \nviability results, the fibers caused an increase in cell metab -\nolism after 72 hours of incubation, especially on OC-k3 and \nPC12 � On the HaCaT cell line, the fibers exhibited a slight \nbut not significant reduction of cell metabolic activity start -\ning from 48 hours of exposure �  In addition, BaTiO3-coated \nPVDF have the most favorable results when it comes to the number of branch points and average length of neurites in \nPC12 cells, leading to a conclusion that BaTiO3 nanoparti -\ncles enhance the complex processes of PC12 cells �\nTo summarize, the investigation revealed that the tested na -\nnofibers exhibited high biocompatibility in vitro, particu -\nlarly with cochlear and neuronal cells, and the piezoelectric \nnanofibers with barium titanate particles be used to devel -\nop the next generation of self-powered cochlear implants � \nTo conclude, these piezoelectric nanofibers have the ability to stimulate the cochlea, even though additional research \nis needed to achieve adequate mechanical and electrical \nperformance �\nIn vivo calcium imaging in the developing mouse cochlea\nDe Faveri F.1, Ceriani F.1, Marcotti W .1,2\n1 School of Biosciences, University of Sheffield, UK\n2

origin and modulation of these \ncalcium signals comes from ex vivo experimental work, which \ncannot replicate the sophisticated anatomy, innervation and \nphysiology of the intact mammalian cochlea � We have de -\nveloped surgical and microscopy approaches that, combined \nwith transgenic animals expressing fluorescent indicators, al -\nlow us to study how mammalian sensory hair cells operate \nin vivo �  Using this approach, we investigated the dynamics \nof spontaneous calcium activity in the prehearing cochlea of \nlive mice at the cellular level �\nMaterial and methods: Mice (P3–P10) expressing the genet -\nically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f in either the hair \ncells or the supporting cells were anaesthetised using isoflu -\nrane and their body temperature maintained with a heat mat � \nThe surgical procedure only led to a very small opening in the apical coil of the cochlear bone, leaving the cochlear ca -\nnals intact and unopened �  The mouse was then transferred \non the stage of a two-photon microscope equipped with long \nworking distance water immersion objectives for imaging �\nResults: This approach allowed us to record from the same \ncochlear region spanning 15–30 IHCs � We found that IHCs \nand supporting cells displayed spontaneous calcium activity \nin vivo throughout the age-range investigated �  IHC activity \nmostly appeared in bursts and some IHCs appeared to tran-sition between quiescent periods and periods of prolonged \nspontaneous activity �  Nearby IHCs displayed both independ -\nent and coordinated activity, which was compatible with the modulation on IHC excitability by calcium waves from the \nsupporting cells �\nConclusions: Our approach provides significant insights \ninto the nature of spontaneous cochlear activity in prehear -\ning mice �  These findings provide the first in vivo physiolog -\nical recordings of spontaneous calcium activity occurring in \nthe mouse pre-hearing cochlea � The application of two-pho

\nPhysiology and Pathology of Hearing, Warsaw/Kajetany, Poland\nCongenital hearing loss can be caused by genetic abnormal -\nities leading to inner ear malformations (IEM) � SLC26A4 \n(pendrin) is an anion exchanger expressed in the inner ear, \nthyroid and β-intercalated cells in the kidney �  Mutations in \nSLC26A4 cause a common form of IEMS: enlarged vestibu-\nlar aqueduct (EV A), often accompanied by incomplete par -\ntition type 2 (EV A/IP2) � However, only 25% of patients have \nconfirmed mutations in SLC26A4 � It has been reported that \na group of polymorphisms upstream of the SLC26A4 gene, \nthe CEV A haplotype, is frequently found in patients with \nmonoallelic SLC26A4  mutations � Since the publication of \nthe zebrafish genome in 2001, the zebrafish has become an increasingly popular animal model for studying human dis -\neases � The transparency of the larvae, the large number of \noffspring and the accessibility of various methods of genet -\nic, chemical and physical manipulation make it a very useful \nmodel for studying inner ear development � During early de -\nvelopment, the inner ear undergoes dynamic changes from \nan otic placode and otic vesicle to a labyrinth of semicircu -\nlar canals � Since data on the expression of genes associated \nwith hearing are incomplete, we present here a detailed ac -\ncount of expression during early development � Secondly, we \nplan to create a zebrafish model for human SLC26A4 gene \nexpression by introducing human upstream regulatory ele -\nments into the zebrafish genome �\nInvestigation of

Center, Hannover, Germany\nIntroduction: Structure and hearing preservation are im -\nportant factors in cochlear implant (CI) surgery �  To improve \noutcomes, impedance measurements of the CI electrode can \nbe used to monitor these parameters after electrode inser -\ntion to detect delayed hearing losses: electrode impedance is \nthought to be a biomarker for inner ear inflammation after \ninsertion of a CI electrode into the cochlea � Within the pre -\nsent study, impedance changes over time were analyzed using \nan app-based solution for daily in-vivo impedance measure -\nments of CI recipients �\nMaterial and methods: N = 22 p articipants were asked to \nuse a research software, the Telemetry Study App, to meas-ure the impedance of all 12 electrode contacts morning and \nevening for a period of at least 4 months after implanta -\ntion� Depending on the start of electrical stimulation, the cohort was divided into (1) direct activation (DA) and (2) \nnon-DA group �\nResults: In both groups, lower impedances were observed \nin the evening compared to the morning with the onset of \nelectrical stimulation � An increase in mean impedances was \nshown up to 10 days after surgery �  Mean impedances of the \nDA group reached a plateau after about 30 days after sur -\ngery while the non-DA group continued to show a slight in -\ncrease �  Impedance values of the DA group remained mostly \nunaffected from the start of the first fitting week (~day 40 \npostoperatively) but decreased in the non-DA group �  Mean \nimpedances of the non-DA group were slightly lower than those of the DA group at this time but converged at the end \nof the investigation period �\nConclusions: The Telemetry App allowed for daily imped-\nance measurements and hence for monitoring of the inner \near condition � With increased measurement frequency, the \nimpedance development over time after CI surgery could be \nshown � In addition, daily impedance fluctuations were ob -\nserved with the onset of electrical stimulation �\nIs there a relationship between voice and hearing?\nDaldova V.1, Merkulava A.2, Kobachidze A.2\n1  Th e Republican Center for Research and

\nimpaired hearing suffer from voice and speech disturbances \ndue to inability to control their own voices � Thus, the pur -\npose of this study was to describe the nature of voice abnor -\nmalities in children with hearing loss �\nMaterial and methods: The study involved 100 aged 4–12 \nyears with a diagnosis of bilateral chronic sensorineural hear -\ning loss � The children underwent subjective and objective \nvoice research methods �\nResults: The most prevalent complaint in children (72 �94%) \nwas a change in voice quality �  Endoscopy of the larynx showed \nno pathological findings in 87 �0%� Acoustic analysis of the \nvoice in children with hearing loss showed the following voice \ndisorders: in Grades 3 to 4 hearing loss, a shift in F0 towards \nlow frequencies of 239 �78 Hz is seen (95% CI 228 �6–250 �95) \n(p < 0�05) �  Children with hearing loss had high Jitter of 1 � 82 \n(95% CI 1 �22–2 �43) that was nearly three times over the nor -\nmal limits ( p < 0�0 5) � M PT in children with Grades 3 to 4 hear -\ning loss was lower than that in children with normal voice and \nhearing and measured 5 �41 s (95% CI 1 �22–2 �43) ( p < 0�05)�\nConclusions: The study found that hearing impairment is as -\nsociated with the development of voice abnormalities � Medical \ncare for children with Grades 3 to 4 hearing loss should in-\nclude measures to identify and treat those

-\nergistically with transcription regulators play a pivotal role \nin the determination and preservation of neuron subtypes � \nMature murine cochlear SGNs comprise four distinct sub -\ntypes, specifically designated as Type Ia, Ib, Ic, and II; how -\never, the definitive regulatory factors conferring specification \nand maintenance of these subtypes are yet to be comprehen -\nsively elucidated �\nMethods:  1� Single-cell transcriptomic analysis: Seurat, \nHarmony, SCENIC, Metascape �  2 �  Adono-associated vi -\nrus (AAV)-based delivery system to murine cochlea � \n3� Single-molecular in situ hybridization (RNASCOPE) � 4� \nElectrophysiological patch-clamp recording �  5 �  Immuno -\nfluorescence staining �\nResults: In this study, we initially constructed a single-cell \ntranscriptomic landscape of SGNs from embryonic, neonatal, \nand adult developmental stages � Utilizing the SCENIC algo -\nrithm designed to predict transcription factor (TF) activity, we \nwere able to identify a sequence of TFs exhibiting time-specif -\nic expression patterns � Interestingly, our data revealed a sub -\nstantial association between the epigenetic cofactor KDM5B \n(Lysine-specific demethylase 5B) and the timing of initial sub -\ntype specification which typically occurs at birth or just prior � \nAltering the gene expression of Kdm5b in the mouse cochlea \nat birth through an AAV-based round window injection re-\nvealed bidirectional effects on subtype markers (Calb1, Calb2, \nand Lypd1) � Specifically, a significant downregulation or \neven complete ablation was observed subsequent to shRNA-  \n-mediated knockdown of Kdm5b � Conversely, overexpression \nof Kdm5b resulted in a reinforcement of mixed SGN identity � \nNotably, both genetic manipulations consequently induced \nauditory impairments in the mice, as determined via the au-\nditory brainstem response (ABR) test � Additionally, bulk RNA \nsequencing data derived from profiling cochlear tissue ech -\noed these findings, reinforcing the importance of Kdm5b in \nthe specification process of SGN subtypes � In sum, our re -\nsults indicate that the epigenetic regulator Kdm5b  is

patients are the use of \nhearing aids or cochlear implants � A lthough they improve the \npatients quality of life, ‘normal’ hearing is not completely re -\nstored �  A primary cause of hearing loss results from damage \nto hair cells (HCs) due to excessive noise exposure, ageing, \nor the exposure to ototoxic drugs � These damaged HCs are \nnot regenerated in humans and can continue to deteriorate \nwith time �  In non-mammalian vertebrates, supporting cells \n(SCs) in the cochlea have regenerative capacities and give rise \nto new HCs after damage, even in adulthood �  Research with \nneonatal mice has also shown that SCs can give rise to new \nHCs after damage in vivo �  Furthermore, neonatal SCs can be \nexpanded and differentiated into hair cells in vitro �  However, \nfor translational purposes, it is important to evaluate if this \nis also possible with adult-derived tissue �\nMaterial and methods: Y oung adult and mature adult \nLgr5GFP transgenic and C57CB/Bl6 mice were used for iso-\nlating cochleas � Cochleas were harvested and, after digestion \nwith thermolysin and accumax, single cells were mixed with \nMatrigel, plated in 3D and grown in a high growth factor me -\ndium containing Wnt, R-spondin, and Noggin conditioned \nmediums � After passaging with trypsin and mechanical trit -\nuration, we evaluated proliferation and differentiation by im -\nmunofluorescence microscopy and qPCR or bulk sequencing �\nResults: Lgr5-expressing SCs derived from adult (p30-p200) \nLgr5GFP transgenic and C57CB/Bl6 mice cochleas can be ex -\npanded to at least 9 passages without losing differentiation \ncapacity �  Lgr5 is highly expressed in expansion medium and \nlost after differentiation � Atoh1  expression increases during \nexpansion and it is lost after differentiation � Myosin7 is not \nexpressed in expansion medium and it is highly enhanced af -\nter differentiation � In parallel, we aim to setup a co-culture \nsystem where we will culture differentiated cochlear orga -\nnoids with spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), to further mim-\nic the in vivo physiology �  This research will be the first step \nto building a functional primary

component of \ngap junctions, which facilitate ion transport between cells � The exchange of ions is an essential process for hearing as it functions as a message between sound detection by the hair

systematic analysis of \nproteins and pathways involved in the protective action of \nSENS-401 �\nMaterial and methods: P3-P5 Wistar rat organotypic explant \ncultures, including both spiral ganglion and organ of Corti \nintact tissue, were exposed or not to 20 h-cisplatin (Cis) and \nco-treated or not with SENS-401 � We used unbiased tandem \nmass tag multiplexed quantitative proteomics coupled with \nhigh performance liquid chromatography and mass spec -\ntrometry (FPP Montpellier) � Bioinformatics data processing \nwas done with MaxQuant & Perseus software �  Differentially \nexpressed proteins (DEPs) obtained by comparing condi -\ntions were analysed using the Panther Classification System, \nthe Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated \nDiscovery (DAVID), and

Advanced Institute for Life \nand Health, Southeast University, China\nLgr5+ progenitors in neonatal mouse cochlea have the ability \nto regenerate hair cells (HCs) by directly transdifferentiation \nor mitotic regeneration, which could be induced by sever -\nal genes and pathways � However, the regeneration ability of \nLgr5+ progenitors is still limited in neonatal mice and is al -\nmost lost in adults � Considering HC regeneration is a com -\nplicated process involving lots of genes and pathways, it is \nnecessary to find more key genes which could induce the pro -\nliferation and differentiation of Lgr5+ progenitors to promote \nHC regeneration � Here, we conjoint analysis our three pre -\nvious RNA-seq data: Lgr5+ progenitors in the apical (ALPs) and basal of mouse cochlea (BLPs), neomycin-treated Lgr5+ \nprogenitors (NLPs) and untreated Lgr5+ progenitors (ULPs), \nLgr5+ progenitors and Lgr5-supporting cells (SCs), screened \nnovel genes which we further explored their effects on the \nproliferation ability of Lgr5+ progenitors by sphere assay in \nvitro �  We found that knockdown of Serpine2 inhibit only the \nproliferation of Lgr5+ progenitors � Serpine2, a member of \nthe Serpins family, is involved in proliferation of various tu -\nmor cells in breast, pancreas and other organs � Our in vitro \nexperiment data showed that Serpine2 may be also involved \nin the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of Lgr5+ \nprogenitors � Here we studied the roles of Serpine2 in HC re -\ngeneration in vivo � W e found that Serpine2 conditional over

Cisplatin, an effective chemotherapeutic agent, \nis clinically limited by its side effects, such as high incidence \nrate of ototoxicity and renal toxicity �  Small extracellular ves -\nicles (sEVs) are derived from almost all cells, and they can \nreflect the physiological and pathological information of par -\nent cells and participate in intercellular communication in the \nprogression of pathologies � However, the cargos and roles of \nsEVs in the progression of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity are \nunclear until now �\nMaterial and methods: Here, we established an ex vivo mod -\nel of neonatal mouse cochlea to scrutinize cisplatin-induced \nototoxicity �  And then, we isolated sEV from the condition -\nal culture medium of cisplatin-induced cochlea explants and \ncharacterized it by TEM, NTA, and western blotting �  Next, \nwe used small RNA sequencing and label free LC-MS/MS to \nprofile the miRNAs and proteins cargos of sEV , respectively �\nResults: The small RNA sequencing of sEVs indicated that 74 \nmicroRNAs (miRNAs) were significantly upregulated and 9 \nmiRNAs were downregulated in cisplatin-treated group (re -\nferred to as Cis-sEV) compared with control group (referred to as Ctrl-sEV) � Furthermore, the targets of these differen -\ntial expressed miRNAs were mainly enriched in apoptosis, \ninflammation, and other cell damage-associated signaling \npathways, which suggested that the miRNAs of sEVs proba-\nbly participate in signal communication in cisplatin-induced \ndamage �  On the other hand, LC-MS/MS analysis of sEV sug -\ngested that there is an obviously differentiation between Cis-\nsEV and Ctrl-sEV , with 90 proteins being upregulated and \n150 proteins being downregulated, including numerous pro -\nteins that could regulate the damage response �  Furthermore, \nwe found 3 proteins (Cltc, Cct2, and Hspa8), which are po -\ntentially involved in protein homeostasis and autophagy, are \nverified to be up-regulated in Cis-sEV compared to Ctrl-sEV \nrather than in cisplatin-damaged cochlear tissue lysis, indi -\ncating that they are likely involved in important and specific \nintercellular communication mechanisms underlying cispl -\natin-induced ototoxicity via sEVs, rather than involving in \nintracellular roles �\nConclusions: Overall, this investigation offers an innovative \nand promising perspective on the molecular changes that oc -\ncur in cochlear cells in response to cisplatin, which could lead \nto a better understanding of ototoxicity and potential targets \nfor therapeutic intervention �\nThe cross-rode between oxidative stress and \ninflammation in the auditory system damage: role of via \nglial cell and macrophages activation in ototoxicity\nPaciello F.1, Pisani A.2, Rolesi R.3, Ripoli

damage in the auditory system, \nresulting in functional alterations and hearing loss � Microglia \nand astrocytes play a crucial role in mediating oxidative/in -\nflammatory injury in the central nervous system; however, \nthe role of glial cells in the auditory damage is still elusive �  In \nthis study, we investigated glial-mediated responses to tox -\nic injury in peripheral and central structures of the auditory \npathway, i � e� , the cochlea and the auditory cortex (ACx), in \nrats exposed to styrene, a volatile compound with well-known \noto/neurotoxic properties � To this aim, male adult Wistar rats \nwere treated with styrene (400 mg/kg daily for 3 weeks, 5/\ndays a week) � At the end of treatment (day 21) electrophys -\niological, morphological, immunofluorescence and molecu -\nlar analyses were performed in both the cochlea and in ACx samples to evaluate the mechanisms underlying styrene-in -\nduced oto/neurotoxicity in the auditory system � We showed \nthat the oto/neurotoxic insult induced by styrene increases \noxidative stress in both cochlea and ACx � This was associat -\ned with macrophages and glial cell activation, increased ex -\npression of inflammatory markers (i � e� , pro-inflammatory \ncytokines and chemokine receptors) and alterations in con -\nnexin (Cxs) and pannexin (Panx) expression, likely respon-\nsible for dysregulation of

      "text": "Journal of Hearing Science® is a quarterly, open-access journal  \npublished since 2011. This peer-reviewed journal publishes \noriginal contributions to knowledge in all areas of otolaryngology, \naudiology, phoniatrics, and rhinology, as well as in related \nfields such as speech-language pathology, speech therapy and rehabilitation, genetics, pharmacology, surgery, and biomedical \nengineering. Our goal is to provide an international forum for the exchange of knowledge in the hearing sciences. We also provide \na space for scientists to present novel theories, in the belief this \ncan make a valuable contribution to the development of science. A secondary aim is to assist the practitioners by providing \nimportant knowledge to help them work with patients with \nhearing, voice, speech, and balance disorders.J Hear Sci  publishes original articles , reviews, hypothesis \npapers, case studies , and conference proceedings . Its language \nis English. The submission, peer-review, and publishing of manuscripts is free of charge . Issues are published both in print \nand electronically at https://www.journalofhearingscience.com/• Research on humans and animals.  J Hear Sci  editors endorse \nthe principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki and expect \nthat all investigations involving humans will have been performed \nin accordance with these principles. For animal experimentation reported in the journal, it is expected that investigators will have \nobserved the Interdisciplinary Principles and Guidelines for the Use of \nAnimals in Research, Testing, and Education issued by the New York \nAcademy of Sciences Ad Hoc Committee on Animal Research. \nAll human and animal studies must have been approved by the \ninvestigator’s institutional review board.• Review process.  J Hear Sci  uses double-blind review , which \nmeans the identities of both reviewer and author are concealed from each other. Manuscripts are evaluated on the basis that they present new insights into the topic, are likely to contribute to \nresearch progress, or change clinical practice or thinking about a \ndisorder. Manuscripts are first examined by the \nJ Hear Sci editors. \nManuscripts of low quality or which contain copied material \nare promptly rejected. Incomplete packages or manuscripts \nnot prepared in the advised style are sent back to authors for adjustment. Authors are notified with a reference number \nupon registration of the manuscript at the Editorial Office, and \nmanuscripts are then sent to independent experts for scientific evaluation. Evaluation usually takes 1–3 months. Following the \npositive opinion of the reviewers, submitted papers are accepted \nfor publication. • Conflict of interests. Authors should disclose at the time \nof submission any financial arrangement they have with any company whose product figures prominently in the manuscript. Such information will be held in confidence while the paper is \nunder review and will not influence the editorial decision, but \nif the article is accepted for publication, the editors will discuss with the authors the manner in which that information will \nbe communicated to the reader. Because the essence of review \npapers is the selection and interpretation of the literature, J Hear \nSci expects that authors will not have any financial interest in a \ncompany (or its competitor) that makes a product discussed in the article.• Permissions. Material taken from other sources must be \naccompanied by a written statement from the copyright holder giving permission for reproduction. Permission in writing is needed from at least one author of papers in press, unpublished \ndata, and personal communications.• Patient confidentiality. Authors of clinical papers must ensure \nthe privacy of patients. If it is possible to identify a patient from a case report, illustration, or paper, J Hear Sci  requires written \nconsent of the patient or their guardian to publish the data. \nDescriptions of race, ethnicity, or culture of a subject should only \nbe used when they are relevant to the medical condition in the \nstudy. When categorising by race, ethnicity, or culture the terms should be as illustrative as possible and reflect the names these \ngroups themselves use.\n• Copyright and license.  Upon acceptance of an article, the authors \ngrant J Hear Sci  a non-exclusive license to publish it. The authors \nwill retain copyright under a CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 PL (Creative Commons Attribution – NonCommercial – NoDerivatives 3.0 PL license). The license allows anyone to download the article and \nshare it with others so long as they credit the authors and source, \ndo not change it in any way, and do not use it commercially. Once an article is accepted for publication, it is embargoed from \nreporting in the media until it appears on the J Hear Sci  website.\n• Disclaimer. J Hear Sci  makes diligent efforts to ensure that no \ninaccurate or misleading data, opinion, or statement appears in the journal. Statements or opinions paper reflect the views of the \nauthor(s) and not those of editors, editorial board, or publisher. Accordingly, the journal disclaims any responsibility or liability \nfor any such statement. The material appearing in advertisements \nis the responsibility of the advertiser. Efforts are made to ensure that drug doses and other quantities are presented accurately; \nnevertheless, readers are advised that methods and techniques \ninvolving drugs and other treatments described in the journal should only be followed if they accord with the manufacturer’s \nown published literature in the reader’s own country.\n• Complaints and appeals. The editors and publisher will \nrespectfully review all reasonable complaints and will deal with them \naccording to the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity \n(https://publicationethics.org/). The exceptions are: 1)  Disputes of \na personal or legal nature; 2) Complaints relating to circumstances \nthat have already been reviewed and investigated or dismissed, \nunless sufficient new evidence is provided to merit reconsideration; \n3) Repeated complaints on meritless or unsubstantiated matters; \n4) Complaints relating to articles published more than 5 years \nago from the date of the complaint; 5) Anonymous complaints; \n6) Allegations made in an offensiv e manner.\nMANUSCRIPTSThe Editorial Board will consider for publication original articles \nwith the understanding that neither the manuscript nor any part \nof its text, tables, or figures have been published previously in print or electronically and are not under consideration elsewhere. \nJ Hear Sci  requires that the corresponding author sign a statement \nthat the work has not been published previously, is completely \noriginal, and has not been submitted elsewhere for review. The \nstatement should also say that the manuscript has been read \nand approved by all authors, and that all of them meet the requirements for genuine authorship. In addition, a statement \nof financial or other relationships that might lead to a conflict of \ninterest is required.Plagiarism. The journal expects all contributions to be entirely \noriginal and the editorial office checks all manuscripts with a \ncomputer program designed to detect similarity ( iThenticate). \nWe take the issue of plagiarism seriously, and if a manuscript \nshows signs of unoriginality, it is automatically rejected and the \nauthor and their institution asked for an explanation.Journal of Hearing Science®Journal of Hearing Science®\nJournal of Hearing Science® is a peer-reviewed, open access journal issued since 2011.
