Twohigb \naDepartment of Communicative Disorders and Deaf Education, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA; bDepartment of Psychology, Utah State \nUniversity, Logan, UT, USA \nABSTRACT \nObjective: To identify treatment research that used a behavioural approach to treat misophonia as the \nprimary focus of treatment, and the audiological testing included in the research.\nDesign: Scoping literature review completed in February 2023 and updated in March 2024.\nStudy Sample: Included studies that provided a behavioural or audiological intervention for misophonia, \nwere peer-reviewed, and published in English before February 29, 2024. Studies were excluded if a \npharmacological treatment was provided, if misophonia was not the primary treatment target, or if the \nassessment of misophonia severity was not a treatment outcome.\nResults: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Six studies had paediatric participants and nine had \nadult participants. Three studies included the identification of audiological comorbidities including hear -\ning ability, hyperacusis, and/or tinnitus in their assessment process. Nine of the studies included assess -\nment for psychological comorbidities. For the different psychological treatment approaches, misophonia \nseverity scores decreased from baseline from 19% to 83%.\nConclusions: There is a need for misophonia research to identify audiological comorbidities and to pro-\nvide evidence-based guidance for addressing them within treatment. Symptoms often appear during \nchildhood and individuals with misophonia would benefit from timely assessment and interdisciplinary \ncoordination to address broader patient impacts in the treatment process.ARTICLE HISTORY \nReceived 15 June 2024 \nRevised 21 November 2024 \nAccepted 7 February 2025 \nKEYWORDS \nAdult; hearing; misophonia; \npaediatric; treatment   \nIntroduction\nMisophonia is a sound tolerance disorder characterised by an \nintense emotional reaction (e.g. anger, irritation, disgust) to spe-\ncific sounds that trigger their reaction, including repetitive \nsounds such as eating, breathing, and tapping (Swedo et al. \n2022 ). This condition was first described by audiologist Marsha \nJohnson in 1990 (Bernstein, Angell, and Dehle 2013 ), and in \n2001 the term misophonia was introduced (Jastreboff and \nJastreboff 2002 ). Research on underlying mechanisms influencing \nmisophonia is evolving, and early models are emerging to \nexplain the pathway for activation of the distressing emotional \nresponse. Recently a social cognitive model was proposed based \non neuroimaging studies and the social context of the perceived \nsound source and the role this plays in the strength of the \nresponse to the trigger (Berger, Gander, and Kumar 2024 ). \nNotably, individuals with misophonia often have hearing thresh -\nolds within normal limits (Jager et al. 2020a ) and objective tests \nof the auditory system have been found to exhibit no differences \nbetween individuals with and without misophonia (e.g. Aryal \nand Prabhu 2023a ; Suraj, Venkateswaran, and Prabhu 2024 ). \nCurrent and future research on the neurophysiological mecha -\nnisms involved and how they are similar or different among peo-\nple suffering from misophonia will inform and refine future \napproaches to treatment. A recent consensus definition of miso -\nphonia (Swedo et al. 2022 ) recognised that misophonia can co- exist with other conditions, including auditory, neurological or \npsychiatric conditions, and for individuals with misophonia, their \nsymptoms of misophonia should not be better explained by a co- \nmorbid condition.\nIdentification of co-morbid conditions represents an impor -\ntant step in providing individuals seeking treatment with coordi -\nnated and comprehensive care, suggesting a need for an \ninterdisciplinary approach for assessment and treatment plan -\nning. Psychological comorbidities include disorders such as \ndepression, anxiety, (Ferrer-Torres and Gim�enez-Llort 2022 ) \nattention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Rouw and Erfanian \n2018 ), as well as other psychiatric disorders. Auditory comorbid -\nities have been found with tinnitus and hyperacusis (Jastreboff \nand Jastreboff 2015 ); however, findings vary among studies, rais-\ning questions about the prevalence of auditory co-morbidities \nand how they impact an individual’s experience with misopho -\nnia, that are not yet clearly defined. For example, hyperacusis \ncan be measured by self-report questionnaires and by measure -\nment of loudness discomfort level (LDL) for discrete tones. A \nrecent study that compared LDLs among three groups (i.e. miso -\nphonia, auditory over-responsivity, and health controls) found \nno statistically significant differences in LDLs among the groups \n(Siepsiak et al. 2022 ). Yet in another study of individuals with \nmisophonia, 71% self-reported hyperacusis (Enzler et al. 2021 ).\nCurrently, there are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria \nfor misophonia; however, it is commonly assessed using \nCONTACT Karen Mu~noz \n karen.munoz@usu.edu \n Department of Communicative Disorders and Deaf Education, Utah State University, 1000 Old Main Hill, \nLogan, UT 84321, USA. \nSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2025.2467768. \nß!2025 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY \nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2025.2467768"

      "text": "questionnaires and/or a structured interview process developed \nto determine severity of and response to trigger sounds. People \nseeking help for coping with their symptoms typically seek out \nservices from audiology, psychology, and psychiatry. The preva -\nlence of clinically significant misophonia is unclear for children \nand adults. A recent study found 20% of college students experi -\nenced distress from misophonia (Brennan et al. 2024 ) and a \npopulation-based sample in Germany aged 16 and older found \n34% reported misophonic sound sensitivities (Pfeiffer, Allroggen, \nand Sachser 2025 ). Misophonia typically emerges in childhood \nand impairment often continues in adulthood (Jager et al. \n2020a ). While the cause of misophonia is not yet known, the \nimpact on daily life is significant and can lead to maladaptive \nways of coping including social isolation (Brout et al. 2018 ).\nTo address the impacts of misophonia and help people man -\nage their response to trigger sounds different approaches have \nbeen used, including psychological and pharmacological inter -\nventions (Mattson et al. 2023 ), tinnitus retraining therapy \n(Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2015 ), and technology to mask trigger \nsounds (Bernstein, Angell, and Dehle 2013 ; Zitelli 2021 ). In a \nrecent systematic review with misophonia as the primary or sec-\nondary focus of psychological and/or pharmacological treatment \n(Mattson et al. 2023 ) the authors concluded that while the inter -\nventions showed potential, there currently is no clear treatment \nrecommendation for misophonia. Furthermore, the authors \nestablished that there was a lack of rigour and comparative stud -\nies in the research, as well as limitations with sample size and \nreplication. One of the treatment studies used tinnitus retraining \ntherapy and identified 28% of their sample with hyperacusis \n(Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014 ). Research does not yet have a \nclear answer for how co-morbid auditory disorders influence the \ntreatment process. The current scoping review extends on the \nMattson et al. (2023 ) study by identifying the status of assess -\nment of auditory conditions in misophonia treatment research to \nprovide additional context.\nTherefore, the purpose of this scoping review was to identify \nand describe treatment research that used a behavioural \napproach to treat misophonia as the primary focus of treatment, \nand the auditory conditions assessed for in the research. This \nscoping review contributes to the literature by providing infor -\nmation on gaps that exist in assessing for co-morbid auditory \nconditions in misophonia treatment research for paediatric and \nadult populations. This information can help guide interdiscipli -\nnary collaboration between behavioural/psychological and audio -\nlogical fields.\nMethods\nThe design for this study was a scoping literature review. \nScoping reviews identify key concepts and research gaps using a \nsystematic process.\nEligibility criteria\nA scoping literature review was completed in February 2023 and \nupdated in March 2024 following guidance from the Joanna \nBriggs Institute (Peters et al. 2022 ). To be included, the studies \nwere in peer-reviewed publications, provided behavioural or \naudiological intervention for misophonia, and were published in \nEnglish before February 29, 2024. Studies were excluded if a \npharmacological treatment was provided, if misophonia was not \nthe primary treatment target, or if insufficient data were pro-\nvided on misophonia treatment outcomes (e.g. outcomes were not measured post-treatment, a misophonia severity measure was \nnot used).\nSearch strategy\nTo identify potentially relevant articles, three databases were \nsearched (MEDLINE, CINAHAL Complete and PsycINFO all via \nEBSCOhost) using the following keywords: 1. (misophonia OR \nsound-tolerance); 2. (intervention OR treatment OR hearing OR \naudiol�). An overarching search string was created that incorpo -\nrated the keywords for the database (see Appendix A for search \nqueries).\nData extraction\nThree authors (DV, MH, and DO) developed a data charting \nform prior to completing the literature search. The articles were \nscreened for inclusion independently by two authors (DV, MH). \nFirst, a title and abstract screening was conducted. The authors \nmet to discuss and resolve any discrepancies in selected articles. \nIn the event of disagreement over inclusion, a third author (DO) \nreviewed the article in question. Second, a full text screening was \ncompleted (DV, MH), and reference lists of included articles \nwere reviewed (DV, MH) to identify additional articles for con-\nsideration. Third, two authors (KM, DV) independently reviewed \narticles using Joanna Briggs methodological quality checklists \nthat were available for the study designs (Gagnier et al. 2013 ; \nMunn et al. 2020 ; Barker et al. 2023 ).\nAnalysis\nStudy details were extracted and entered in an Excel spreadsheet \n(i.e. publication date, first author, study design, participant infor -\nmation, outcome measure(s), treatment information, and audio -\nlogical tests). The articles were divided into two groups to show \nthe status of assessing for auditory conditions based on partici -\npant age (i.e. paediatric [under 18years] and adult [18years and \nolder]) and narratively synthesised.\nResults\nThe database search identified 934 articles after duplicates were \nremoved. Title and abstract screening excluded 885, one article \ncould not be accessed, and 34 were excluded during full-text \nscreening. One article was identified from the reference list \nreview; a total of 15 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclu -\nsion (see Figure 1for the PRISMA [Preferred Reporting Items \nfor Systematic reviews and Meat-Analyses] flowsheet). Six studies \nhad paediatric participants (Table 1) and nine had adult partici -\npants (Table 2).\nPaediatric\nThe six studies with paediatric participants were case reports. \nThe children and adolescents ranged in age from 10 to 17years. \nMisophonia onset reported in five of the studies was from \napproximately age 5 to 11years. The Amsterdam Misophonia \nScale (AMISO-S) and/or the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) \nwere used to measure severity. All the studies provided psycho -\nlogical interventions and decreases in severity were found post- \ntreatment. Psychological comorbidities were assessed for in all 2\n K. MUÑOZ ET AL."

Three case studies \nused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) (McGuire, Wu and \nStorch 2015 ; Cecilione, Hitti, and Vrana 2022 ; Dover and \nMcGuire 2023 ). One study used a family-based approach and \nfound family accommodations decreased by 75% from a high \nlevel of accommodation at pre-treatment (Dover and McGuire \n2023 ). One study measured treatment gains beyond post- \ntreatment and improvements were maintained at six months \n(Schneider and Arch 2017 ).\nAdult\nThe nine studies with adult participants used various research \ndesigns and different measures were used to assess severity, \nincluding AMISO-S, MQ, Amsterdam Misophonia Scale – \nRevised (AMISO-R), Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire \n(MAQ), and/or Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Study \n(SFive), and some also used Clinical Global Impressions \nImprovement (CGI-I). Psychological comorbidities were assessed \nfor in three studies and other medical comorbidities (i.e. \nmigraine, irritable bowel, hyperthyroidism) were reported in one \nstudy. Two studies assessed for audiological comorbidities. \nVanaja and Abigail (2020 ) used a retraining treatment and \nassessed hearing ability and findings were within normal limits \nwith no evidence of hyperacusis based on measurement of loud -\nness discomfort levels, although there was a previous diagnosis \nof hyperacusis by another clinic. Jager et al. (2020b ) used a CBT \ntreatment and self-report to assess hearing ability, tinnitus, and \nhyperacusis; three participants had previously been diagnosed \nwith tinnitus and no other hearing problems were reported.\nOpen trial and randomized controlled trial (RCT)\nThe open trial (Schr oder et al. 2017 ) and the RCT (Jager et al. \n2020b ) excluded individuals with significant comorbid condi -\ntions. The age of misophonia onset was 12.5 years (SD 4.8) in \nthe open trial, and was not reported in the RCT. At the end of \ntreatment for the open trail, 48% met the criteria for response to \ntreatment, defined as a 30% or greater reduction on the AMISO- \nS and a score of 1 or 2 (very much improved; much improved) on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I); no fol-\nlow-up assessment was completed. For the RCT, the AMISO-R \nshowed a large effect size (d1.97) in the treatment group com -\npared to the wait list for the decrease in misophonia severity, \nand on the CGI-I, 37% of the treatment showed a clinical \nresponse for misophonia, compared to 0% in the wait list group, \nand these improvements maintained at the one-year follow-up.\nSingle subject design\nThis study used a multiple baseline design across trigger stimuli \n(Dozier 2015a ). The participant experienced triggers from both \nauditory and visual stimuli for their misophonia and reported \nmisophonia onset at age seven. The treatment was behavioural \ncounterconditioning, a technique used for Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder (PTSD) and was delivered remotely. Misophonia sever -\nity decreased from a moderate to a mild level for auditory trig-\ngers based on the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire \n(MAQ). This case treated single triggers in one context, and it is \nnot clear if the treatment would be as effective if multiple trig-\ngers were present or if they occurred in different contexts.\nCase series\nIn the study conducted by Jager et al. (2021 ), seven participants \ncompleted the treatment. The mean age of onset was 13years \n(SD 9.75), and individuals with significant comorbid condi -\ntions were excluded from participation. Participants received Eye \nMovement Desensitisation & Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR), \nwhich focused on misophonia memories that were emotionally \ndisturbing. Number of sessions varied by the number of target \nmemories for the person and ranged from one to four sessions. \nTwo participants (28%) met the criteria for a full response to \ntreatment, defined as a 25% or more reduction measured by the \nAMISOS-R and a CGI-I score of less than three. In the case ser-\nies conducted by Gregory, Graham, and Hayes (2024 ) 19 con-\nsecutive cases were retrospectively reviewed for patients who \ncompleted CBT treatment. Session length and treatment compo -\nnents varied, and age of onset was not reported. The MQ and \nAMISO-S both had a large effect size for pre-treatment to fol-\nlow-up changes, with Cohen’s d of 1.63 and 1.55 respectively. \nReliable improvement on the MQ was found for 78% of the Table 2.

      "text": "participants, and 61% were deemed to have clinically significant \nchanges.\nCase reports\nThree different approaches to treatment were used, including \nretraining therapy with desensitisation and habituation (Vanaja \nand Abigail 2020 ), CBT (Altın oz, Unal, and Tosun Altın oz 2018 ; \nGregory and Foster 2023 ), and counterconditioning (Neural \nRepatterning Technique [NRT]) with treatments conducted inde -\npendently using a smart phone app plus four sessions with the \ntherapist (Dozier 2015b ). The smart phone app treatment was \ndeveloped based on a previous study by the same author (Dozier \n2015a ). Age of onset ranged from approximately six to 24years. \nAll cases reported decreased misophonia severity after treatment. \nOne decreased from a severe to a mild level on the AMISO-S \nwith results that maintained at three months follow-up (Vanaja \nand Abigail 2020 ). Another decreased from a moderate to a sub- \nclinical level at post-treatment (no follow-up assessment com -\npleted) on the AMISO-S (Altın oz, Unal, and Tosun Altın oz \n2018 ). In another, auditory triggers decreased from a severe to a \nmild level (visual triggers remained) on the MAQ and gains \nwere maintained at the 12-month follow-up (Dozier 2015b ). \nGregory and Foster (2023 ) used the SFive to measure outcomes \nand described meaningful changes from one session to the next, \nand found scores decreased 83% from “significantly burdensome \nsymptoms” at pre-treatment.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this scoping review was to identify and describe \ntreatment research that used a behavioural approach to treat \nmisophonia as the primary focus of treatment, and the audio -\nlogical testing included in the research. Only three studies \nassessed for auditory conditions. One case report with an adult \nparticipant completed an audiological test battery finding pure \ntone thresholds within normal limits, excellent word recognition \nin quiet, and a determination of no hyperacusis (Vanaja and \nAbigail 2020 ). One case report with a paediatric participant \nassessed for hyperacusis with a negative finding (Cecilione, Hitti, \nand Vrana 2022 ). One randomized clinical trial (Jager et al. \n2020b ) completed auditory assessments but did not incorporate \nthe auditory findings in the treatment process. How auditory co- \nmorbid conditions should be considered within misophonia \ntreatment research is unknown. The gap in research represents \nan opportunity to expand the understanding of auditory co-mor -\nbidities in future misophonia treatment research.\nThe misophonia treatment research to date is limited. Two- \nthirds of the studies in this review were case reports. The retro -\nspective nature of describing a single case has risk of bias from \nfocusing on a single unusual case or outcome. It is not possible \nto determine a cause-effect relationship from the treatment and \nthe results cannot be generalised to others. There was one RCT \nand outcomes were compared to individuals on a waiting list (no \ntreatment) and evaluator bias may have influenced the clinical \ninterview because they were aware of the treatment condition. \nFuture studies are needed that include (a) independent evalua -\ntors, (b) an active control group to identify treatment factors \nassociated with symptom reduction, including treatment type, \nduration, and delivery considerations, (c) identification of \ncomorbid conditions (e.g. psychological and audiological), (d) \ninclusion of audiological testing and description of parameters \nused to define and characterise auditory considerations, and (e) and more research with children and adolescents to inform prac -\ntice protocols given gaps in protocol guidance for hyperacusis \nand tinnitus assessment.\nResearchers have identified the need for comprehensive \nassessment that involves a team of professionals (Schr oder et al. \n2017 ; Palumbo et al. 2018 , Ferrer-Torres and Gim�enez-Llort \n2022 ), including audiologists (Aryal and Prabhu 2023b ). \nIdentification of comorbid conditions is needed to understand \nthe issues influencing an individual’s experience with misophonia \nand to inform treatment planning. Aryal and Prabhu (2023b ) \nrecommended including objective hearing assessment measures \nto support the evaluation and treatment process along with the \nsubjective measures used to determine misophonia severity. \nStudies have reported co-occurrence of tinnitus and hyperacusis \nwith misophonia (Siepsiak and Dragan 2019 ; Brennan et al. \n2024 ), and Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2015 ) recommend treating \nhyperacusis first when it is present. There is a need to under -\nstand the complex relationships among auditory conditions and \nmisophonia and to determine how they influence treatment. For \nexample, in a sample of children with auditory processing disor -\nders, 13% also had misophonia and these children were more \nlikely to also have hyperacusis and/or tinnitus (Ahmmed and \nVijayakumar 2024 ). There are critical practice implications \nrelated to the age of misophonia onset, timely initiation of treat -\nment, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.\nAlthough there is limited treatment research, the studies to \ndate support the importance of timely assessment and manage -\nment of misophonia. Most of the participants in this review \nreported childhood onset, as young as five years (e.g. Petersen \nand Twohig 2023 ), underscoring the need for validated assess -\nment tools for the paediatric population. Importantly, studies \ndescribed symptoms worsening and having additional triggers \nover time (e.g. Dozier 2015a ), increasing risk for negative conse -\nquences such as isolation and emotional distress. These trends of \nchildhood onset and increasing symptoms over time were also \nfound in a large study of misophonia (N575; onset age \nM13.17 [SD 7.37]; Jager at al. 2020b). Family engagement \nin management can provide an important source of support as \nindividuals learn effective coping strategies. One study with a \npaediatric patient used a family-based approach and family \nmembers learned to be adaptive rather than reactive, such as \nimplementing catchphrases to help the child use coping strategies \nin daily life (Dover and McGuire 2023 ). In another study with a \npaediatric patient, the mother participated in the last ten minutes \nof each session to support homework engagement between ses-\nsions (Petersen and Twohig 2023 ), and one group treatment \nstudy included family and friends in one psychoeducation ses-\nsion (Jager et al. 2020b ).\nThere are important clinical implications for promoting an \ninterdisciplinary approach within practice. When audiology is \nthe point of entry for care, there is the risk that consideration \nfor psychological comorbid conditions may be overlooked, and \ntreatment may not adequately take into consideration the influ -\nence of behavioural coping mechanisms on quality of life. For \nexample, a narrow focus on sound attenuation (e.g. use of ear-\nplugs) to help an individual eat dinner with their family would \nlimit sound tolerance and emotional adjustment to the distress \nby reinforcing avoidance of the trigger sounds (Lewin et al. \n2021 ). Determining the balance for when and how to use strat -\negies is important for longer-term management. Individuals suf-\nfering from misophonia seek services from audiologists. There is \na need for clinical protocols in audiology to guide practice. \nFurthermore, comprehensive assessment and interdisciplinary INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY\n 5"

Other research that treated misopho -\nnia as a secondary concern with another condition was not \nreviewed. This could have limited our understanding of how \nauditory co-morbidities have been considered in treatment \nresearch. Furthermore, only studies published in English were \nreviewed.\nConclusion\nMisophonia treatment research is limited; however, the early \nresearch is promising and demonstrates people suffering from \nmisophonia can experience improvement with treatment. There \nis an urgent need for research to identify treatment factors asso-\nciated with symptom reduction to provide evidence-based guid -\nance for evaluating and treating misophonia. Individuals with \nmisophonia can have co-occurring conditions that would benefit \nfrom interdisciplinary coordination to address broader patient \nimpacts in the treatment process.\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\nFunding\nThis project was partially supported by a grant from the Misophonia \nResearch Fund.\nData availability statement\nThe datasets generated during and analysed during the current study \nare available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAhmmed, A., and S.
