   ```
3. For Firebase Cloud Functions, navigate to the functions directory and run:
   ```

## Notes

- The Firebase client and admin SDKs are separate packages with different use cases:
  - `firebase` is for client-side applications
  - `firebase-admin` is for server-side applications and has elevated privileges

- For the RAG system, the key dependencies are:
  - `openai`: For generating embeddings and AI responses
  - `firebase-admin`: For accessing Firestore vector database
  - `pdfjs-dist`: For processing PDF documents
  - `express`: For the web server interface
